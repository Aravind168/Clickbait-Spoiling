Image: The American Chemical Society\", \"Imagine if we could be like plants, lying outside all day soaking up sweet, sweet energy from the sun. Doesn’t sound like a bad life, does it? So why aren’t the world’s best minds figuring out how to hack photosynthesis into humans?\", \"It turns out there are a lot of reasons, which are spelled out in a new video by the American Chemical Society. First, there are aesthetics to consider: your cells would have to be packed with light-harvesting pigments called chlorophyll, meaning you’d be bright green, or maybe a custom-tailored shade of red or blue. (Although I’m pretty sure you wouldn’t have ivy sprouting out of your forehead.) But far more problematic than your skin’s unusual hue is the energetics of photosynthesis.\", \"Eating sunlight isn’t all that efficient—plants are only able to put a few percent of the energy packed away in the sun’s rays to work. For your average tree, that translates to about 200 calories a day. The reason our leafy green friends can get by on such a lean diet is that they live a very sedentary lifestyle, so unless you really want to lay in the sun all day and also be braindead, you’d need to supplement your solar meals with a regular intake of cheeseburgers. (Also, your body would still require protein in addition to the sugar you’re producing from photosynthesis, so again, cheeseburgers.)\", \"Finally, plants maximize the amount of energy they can capture by growing their leaves very thin. Your sausage fingers and burrito arms are ill suited for the task, so you’d probably want to scrap them for bionic sail appendages instead. Is this sounding fun or what!\", \"Insurmountable obstacles aside, the idea of hacking photosynthesis into humans has gotten real scientific consideration, and there are animals out there that really do photosynthesize, in a way. So, even though our descendants will never live entirely off the sun, who knows? Maybe distance runners of the future will be able to charge up with a little solar snack now and again.\", \"[American Chemical Society]\"\n",

        "# LINKED TEXT: \"When asked to describe the current state of California cuisine, chef Daniel Patterson replies with a simple, \\\"I don't think I'm qualified to answer that.\\\"\", \"Modest words from someone who has been lauded as \\\"a leading force in California cuisine\\\" and \\\"the man single-handedly reinventing California cuisine,\\\" and whose food has been revered as \\\"a signature cerebral brand of California cuisine.\\\"\", \"Whether he chooses to embrace these accolades or not, Patterson's cooking undoubtedly embodies the very best of California cooking, fusing fresh and seasonal local treasures with innovative preparations and presentations. The proprietor of San Francisco's double-Michelin-starred Coi shows the figs-on-a-plate crowd who's boss, transforming ingredients into the very best versions of themselves: asparagus blanched in asparagus water, strawberries coated in a strawberry glaze.\", \"And his influence continues to expand throughout the Bay Area and the world. Alongside the enduring popularity of Coi and his handful of restaurants in downtown Oakland, Patterson's first-ever cookbook, the aptly titled \\\"Coi: Stories and Recipes,\\\" comes out this month (he's also an avid food writer, and the book features original essays that accompany dozens of recipes). The newest addition to Patterson's ever-expanding empire will be the \\\"very casual\\\" Alta CA, slated to open in San Francisco's burgeoning Mid-Market neighborhood later this year.\", \"The Huffington Post recently caught up with Patterson to see if we could glean any morsels of wisdom from the self-taught chef and father of two. Herewith, a few lessons from an icon most certainly qualified to discuss the state of California cuisine and beyond.\", \"Patterson, right, preparing food in Madrid.\", \"1) Eat your veggies. Coi's evolving tasting menu is often vegetable-centric, a testament to the flavor complexity of plants. \\\"It's how we like to cook; it's how I like to eat,\\\" Patterson says, adding that Northern California is known for its produce. \\\"We have extraordinary vegetables here ... it's more challenging and ultimately rewarding for me to work with products that have a much greater range of flavor.\\\"\", \"2) Enjoy said veggies a few weeks after their season starts. \\\"We won't take things at the beginning of the season,\\\" Patterson, who sources his menu from a wide range of \\\"the very best\\\" foragers and producers in the Bay Area, explains. \\\"We wait until they are at peak flavor.\\\"\", \"3) Ingredients dictate everything. The dishes on Patterson's menus take shape only after he and his team know exactly which ingredients they'll be using. \\\"We mostly focus on what tastes good,\\\" he says. \\\"We'll let the ingredients talk a little bit, figure out where they want to go at any given time.\\\"\", \"4) Don't serve complex foods to your 4-year-old. When asked if he feeds his son dishes from the Coi menu, Patterson responds with, \\\"Hell no!\\\" At home, he says, he focuses on simple meals. \\\"We have a slow cooker,\\\" he says. \\\"I'll roast a chicken, throw the bones in with some water. Add some vegetables, take the bones out, put in some beans, turn that into dinner with some greens.\\\"\", \"5) You can succeed without a mentor. Patterson never attended culinary school or worked under a renowned chef, instead opting to open his first restaurant in Sonoma at the age of 25. \\\"I was able to start cooking and figure out what my style was without any preconceived ideas,\\\" he says. \\\"At the same time, I think it took me a lot longer to figure things out than it would have if I’d worked under a mentor. That would have been great, too -- there are pros and cons to both.\\\"\", \"6) It's no fun to play favorites. \\\"My favorite dish is always the next one I'm working on,\\\" Patterson says.\"\n",

There are many theories about why cats knead their paws into you, but many researchers agree that they’re trying to return the affection that you’re showing them. They just don’t know that it actually hurts.2. Sure, it’s kind of gross when cats bring dead animals into the house, but they do it because they consider you family – and they’re trying to teach you how to catch your own prey.3. When cats rub their head against you, they’re marking you as one of their own with the concentrated scent glands in their cheeks and head. Congratulations, you’re family.4. A cat’s unending stare can be a little bit disconcerting, but don’t fret. First of all, they’re not really staring. Their eyes are evolved to blink less frequently than ours. But more than that, a steady, soft gaze means that they feel safe and comfortable with you.5. Like most creatures, cats don’t like to make themselves vulnerable.
