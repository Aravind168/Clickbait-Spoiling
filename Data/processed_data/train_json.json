[{"question": "NASA sets date for full recovery of ozone hole", "context": "2070 is shaping up to be a great year for Mother Earth.That's when NASA scientists are predicting the hole in the ozone layer might finally make a full recovery. Researchers announced their conclusion, in addition to other findings, in a presentation Wednesday during the annual American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.The team of scientists specifically looked at the chemical composition of the ozone hole, which has shifted in both size and depth since the passing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987. The agreement banned its 197 signatory countries from using chemicals, like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), that break down into chlorine in the upper atmosphere and harm the ozone layer.They found that, while levels of chlorine in the atmosphere have indeed decreased as a result of the protocol, it's too soon to tie them to a healthier ozone layer.\"Ozone holes with smaller areas and a larger total amount of ozone are not necessarily evidence of recovery attributable to the expected chlorine decline,\" Susan Strahan of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center explained in a media briefing. \"That assumption is like trying to understand what's wrong with your car's engine without lifting the hood.\"Instead, the scientists believe the most recent ozone hole changes, including both the largest hole ever, in 2006, and one of the smallest holes, in 2012, are primarily due to weather. Strong winds have the ability to move ozone in large quantities, effectively blocking the hole some years, while failing to block it in others.\"At the moment, it is winds and temperatures that are really controlling how big [the ozone hole] is,\" Strahan told the BBC.LiveScience reports weather is expected to be the predominant factor in the ozone hole's size until 2025, at which point CFCs will have dropped enough as a result of the Montreal Protocol to become noticeable.By 2070, however, the ozone hole is expected to have made a full recovery.\"It\u2019s not going to be a smooth ride,\" Strahan cautioned the Los Angeles Times. \"There will be some bumps in the road, but overall the trend is downward.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [0], "text": ["2070"]}, "id": "411701128456593408"}, {"question": "This is what makes employees happy -- and it's not their paycheck", "context": "Despite common belief, money isn't the key to employee happiness, new research finds.A study by hiring software provider Cangrade revealed that being intellectually stimulated is the most important aspect of an employee's job satisfaction. Specially, those surveyed said intellectual stimulation accounts for 18.5 percent of their job satisfaction.That's compared to money, which accounts for just 5.4 percent of how happy an employee is with the job. Achievement and prestige, power and influence, work-life balance and affiliation and friendship were all rated more important to job satisfaction than money.\"These findings are quite surprising, because employers often assume things like income are the strongest drivers of happiness in the workplace,\" said Steve Lehr, Cangrade's chief science officer. \"In fact, our research shows that it may be the weakest.\"Researchers developed a three-part formula for employers who are eager to keep their staff happy:Try to ensure that jobs provide intellectual stimulation and task variety. Give employees some autonomy, influence and opportunities to acquire prestige and recognition. Employers should give employees these things even when they don't say they need them. Give them even more if they say they do.Employers should give all employees a break now and again, including the consummate workaholics who say they don't want or need it.Offer employees extra money, security and social opportunities. However, only to the extent they say these things matter to them.\"If there is a major takeaway here, it's that we can finally prove that money doesn't buy happiness, and that happiness isn't as elusive as we might think,\" said Cangrade CEO Michael Burtov.The study was based on surveys of nearly 600 U.S. employees.", "answers": {"answer_start": [271], "text": ["intellectual stimulation"]}, "id": "380537005123190784"}, {"question": "The perfect way to cook rice so that it's perfectly fluffy and NEVER sticks to the pan", "context": "Boiling rice may seem simple, but there is a very fine line between under-cooked crunchy grains and mushy over-cooked stodge.But now the perfect way to cook the rice has been shared on question-and-answer website Quora - and all it requires is one piece of equipment.Users were responding to the question 'How does one cook rice properly?' - proving that the basics are not always as simple to cook as we may think.Scroll down for video The top voted answer for how to cook perfectly, which has been used more than 4,000 times, was refreshingly simple - but it does require some investment.Several commenters agreed that the best way to cook rice is in a rice cooker, which you can pick up from most high street stores for between \u00a315 and \u00a320.Cliff Chang wrote: 'Seriously, it's so much easier than any other method I've tried.'Take your rice, wash it a bit - not too much - add enough water so that the waterline is twice as high as the rice-line.

That's higher than expected and poses a clear and massive hurdle for Republicans as they attempt to convince dozens of skeptical members.But there's another number that paints a particularly dire picture for the GOP's alternative \u2014 especially in light of President Trump's populist rhetoric.According to the CBO, 64-year olds making $26,500 per year would see their premiums increase by an estimated 750 percent by 2026. While they are on track to pay $1,700 under the current law, the CBO projects the American Health Care Act would force them to pay $14,600. Even if you grant that inflation will allow them to make slightly more money by 2026, that's still about half of their income going to health care.Here's how that looks as a percentage of income (h/t Philip Bump):As skeptics of the law noted, that suggests the reason premiums as a whole will eventually decline is because older, poorer people simply won't be able to afford it. The legislation reduces premiums substantially for younger people but increases them substantially for older people \u2014 and especially poorer, older people \u2014 according to the CBO.The CBO's estimate of the premium increases for older, poorer Americans is actually worse than a previous one from AARP. Here's what AARP, which has announced its opposition to the bill, said last week:... Our estimates find that, taken together, premiums for older adults could increase by as much as $3,600 for a 55-year old earning $25,000 a year, $7,000 for a 64-year old earning $25,000 a year and up to $8,400 for a 64-year old earning $15,000 a year.If you're a Republican looking at these numbers, you have to be concerned \u2014 just from a self-preservation standpoint.Republican leaders have made great pains to argue that the CBO's estimate of the millions who will lose insurance is faulty, or even that it's a necessary side effect of returning to a more free-market approach to health care. But the GOP's counter-argument is predicated on the idea that its alternative would at least allow people access to coverage. Paying such a substantial portion of one's income on health insurance doesn't meet that goal \u2014 if, in fact, the CBO's estimate is anywhere close to accurate.It also affects a group of voters who are integral to the Trump Coalition. Less-formally educated and lower-income white Americans were the backbone of the electoral shift that allowed President Trump to be elected, and he has promised them the world: Coverage that is even more affordable than the Affordable Care Act and \"insurance for everybody.\"On top of all that, older people are much more likely to vote than younger people, especially in a midterm election like 2018. So basically, Trump's win was built on older, poorer people, for whom this law appears to drive up premiums and drive down the insurance rate, while benefiting the younger and wealthier.That's not something that will assure skeptical Republicans at all \u2014 even if they can get past that 24 million number.", "answers": {"answer_start": [581], "text": ["750 percent"]}, "id": "841679598526091265"}, {"question": "#TeenMom2 star @PBandJenelley_1 reveals the sex of her second child through social media", "context": "\"Teen Mom 2\" star Jenelle Evans took to Twitter and Instagram Monday (Feb. 3) to announce that she and boyfriend Nathan Griffin are expecting a baby boy.Evans has faced criticism for the pregnancy, largely because she does not currently have custody of her first child, 4-year-old Jace.

We asked the experts for their best advice on where and how to cash in.By Lynn AndrianiStart With Your WardrobeDavid Weinrot, chief marketing officer at the coupon code site Tada!, says apparel is the top category for sitewide coupon codes (flowers and home goods are big, too), since there's so much inventory and retailers constantly need to make room for new items. Clothing is also where you'll find the biggest discounts, says Daniel Washburn, general manager of another coupon-code site, Coupon Mountain. While some sites broadcast a \"25% off today only!\" coupon code at the top of their home page, more use coupon sites (which get a commission of about 5 percent when you click on a code) to get the word out. There are a couple of tricks to finding these money-saving treasures, aside from searching for a store name with a term like \"coupon\" or \"coupon code,\" says Sarah Jones, coupon editor at DealNews.com. For clothing, she searches the brand name and style name (e.g., \"Michael Kors Chain Lace-Up Shirtdress\") plus the word \"coupon.\" Then she searches for coupons for stores that sell the item, to see what they are currently offering. The idea is to do a mix of general and specific searches to see what comes up.Upgrade Your Electronics Piece by PieceTech retailers, such as TigerDirect and Newegg, release the most coupon codes, says Jones -- but you won't find 30 percent off everything sitewide with those retailers. Since the category has such small margins, stores can't afford to discount widely; instead, they offer codes that give heavy discounts for particular items. For the quickest results, Jones likes to search by model number (this works especially well for electronics and computers).Shop At The Beginning Of The Month -- Or On A MondayMost retailers release their codes onto sales channels at the beginning of the month, and the majority expire on the 15th or 30th. In particular, Weinrot says retailers that sell items that need replenishing -- such as vitamins, diapers and contact-lens solutions -- tend to release coupon codes early in the month, since they know that's when people tend to restock. You can look for codes throughout the month on Mondays, since many stores rotate new offers on a weekly basis, says Jones.Do The MathPrices vary widely: You might find that one store's price without a coupon might be better than another store's price with one. Also consider shipping costs. For instance, a store that has everyday free shipping may have a price that comes out lower with a 10-percent-off coupon than another store's 20-percent coupon with shipping charges added, says Jones. A general rule of thumb: For smaller purchases, take a free shipping code over a code for 10 percent off; for larger purchases, 10 percent (or more) off will probably save you more money than free shipping would.Know Who DiscountsSome stores rarely or never offer coupon codes (Jones cites Walmart and Zappos as examples).

In fact, bees, wasps, hornets, dogs and even cows kill more Americans each year than alligators \u2014 or even sharks \u2014 do.The Washington Post used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u2014 the U.S. health agency based in Atlanta \u2014 to show which animals cause the most deaths in the country each year .

Cows killed 20 people each year, dogs killed 28, and a separate category called \"other mammals\" accounted for 52 deaths per year. Sharks, alligators and bears killed one person each year, on average.The deaths caused by cows don\u2019t include health problems from eating beef; according to the CDC, most of the cow-related deaths happen to people working with cattle in enclosed areas or herding them. Their handlers typically have died from blunt force trauma to their heads or chests.That said, alligator attacks happen more often than once a year; they just aren\u2019t always fatal.Alligators bit nine people in 2015 in the state of Florida, and one of them fatally \u2014 a 61-year-old man who was snorkeling was killed by a 12-foot alligator \u2014 according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

But when the most awaited day of his life came, he had never prepared for the news that hit him so hard in the face.The Father-To-BePaul Servat is a man in his mid-thirties. He was living in Montreal with his family and friends. Due to his busy schedule, he never realized that he was growing old.Looking at his friends happy and content with their own families, Paul had realized he wanted to build a family of his own. He was at the height of his career, fit and healthy and he knew that it\u2019s time for him to look for his other half. Of course, there\u2019s an accessible place to do so.A Whirlwind RomanceAt the age of technology, Paul had easily found his match on a dating site. It was 2013 when a woman named Barbara Bienvenue caught his attention. He was two years her junior and he can easily make her laugh.At their age, there was no time for long courtship. After a few weeks of chatting with each other, they decided to meet in Montreal. The two clicked together and they started dating. Soon enough, the whirlwind romance had blossomed into something else.A Sudden But Delightful NewsBarely two months after dating exclusively, Barbara called Paul and told him that she had something to say. As they were only at the earliest stage of their relationship, Paul had no idea what his girlfriend would say.When they met, Barbara was smiling from ear to ear. And when she told him the good news, there was a quick moment of shock for Paul. But when the news synced in, a big grin formed on his face as well. At last, he\u2019s going to be a father!The Whole Neighborhood RejoicedPaul was swept away by the news. Just a few months ago, he had longed to build a family of his own. Before he knew it, all that he ever prayed was being handed to him. He couldn\u2019t be any happier.When his family and friends found out about the good news, they all felt happy for the couple. They even held a celebration to express how much delighted they are for what was happening in their lives. From that day on, the excited father-to-be began his countdown.Additional BlessingsAdditional BlessingsAs weeks passed by, the couple began to notice that Barbara\u2019s tummy was unusually big. Realizing they might be expecting twins, Barbara went to undergo checkup and when she returned, Paul couldn\u2019t help but jump for joy. They are going to have more than one child, and even more than two. In the begining Paul couldn't believe it, but they were going to have no less than five children!They Must Be PreparedBarbara was one of the lucky women in the world who had conceived quintuplets. Paul couldn\u2019t believe his ears at first. Unlike his friends who had fathered children in their twenties, he was past his prime of becoming a father. But when it was finally given to him, he had it big time! However, there also came his worries.Paul was earning an average income. It was enough to start a family but wouldn\u2019t be sufficient for five. Lucky for them, they had family, friends, and neighbors who were more than willing to lend a helping hand. The preparation for the quintuplets\u2019 arrival has begun.Setting Up a Facebook PageSince the inception of social media platforms, getting help had never been easier. With the help of his friends and co-workers, Paul had set up a Facebook page. He shared their story and used the page to document Barbara\u2019s pregnancy. From his personal to professional contacts, Paul humbly asked for sponsorships.Aside from their neighbors, help from the local businesses in their community had arrived. To be able to show how grateful they are, they took photos of the gifts and posted them on the Facebook page. They want everyone to know that their efforts are paying off.Healthy PregnancyWith each passing day, Paul grew more and more excited. He was always on Barbara\u2019s side whenever she asked for something. He had been so patient of her mood swings and was careful to her like she\u2019s a baby herself. He never wanted anything bad to happen to the mother of his children.So that Barbara wouldn\u2019t get bored in the house, they started arranging the room of their babies. It was such an unforgettable moment for Paul and he felt younger than ever. If only he could, he would pull the days. But for the meantime, he had to be patient. As they say, all good things are worth the wait.Moments to CherishAll throughout the waiting ordeal, Paul felt extremely happy. Even the happiness of his parents who are longing for grandchildren was evident. Her mother was always with Barbara, assisting her in her needs whenever he\u2019s away.Aside from updating the generous people on Facebook, Paul and Barbara had solemn moments as well. His girlfriend had given him the opportunity to pick the names for their babies and he deeply appreciates it. A month before the due date, Paul was confident that they were ready.The Time Has ComeBarbara was on her 34th week when it happened. She was hysterical as she told Paul that her water broke. Usually, a full-term pregnancy consists of 37 weeks. It was his first time to deal with this kind of situation. However, he knew from his research that he needed to stay calm.As fast as he could, he prepared the things and took his girlfriend to the hospital. His family accompanied them as well. Finally, the most awaited day of his life has arrived.Necessary PrecautionsWhen they arrived at the hospital, the doctors attended to Barbara right away. Since she was not yet in the pain of labor, the necessary processes were done. She was checked up and the doctor performed an ultrasound.Paul was nervous and excited at the same time. He was waiting outside for great news. When the doctor finally went out, Paul was quite surprised at the expression on his face. He\u2019s looking confused. Could there be a problem with the babies? His heart skipped a beat.Misunderstanding and ConfusionJudging by the frown on his face, Paul can sense that something was wrong. The staff nurses were clearly uneasy as well. He can\u2019t wait for answers any longer. He approached the doctor.Paul was then taken aside. The doctor was unsure where to start. Perhaps he was even contemplating on the fact that he discovered. Then, like a sword, his words hit Paul\u2019s heart and mind.What Went Wrong?In his excitement, Paul had a hard time accepting what the doctor was saying. His girlfriend was still inside the emergency room. His family was around him, all were eagerly waiting for Barbara\u2019s safe delivery.However, the doctor was explaining there were no babies to expect at all. Barbara was not pregnant in the first place. For the love of God, Paul couldn\u2019t understand what was happening. How on Earth could this happen?Seeing the SignsFor almost nine months, Paul had been with Barbara. He saw her belly grew and he was there when her morning sickness was on its height. She was starting to make milk as well. Even his mom had never sensed that there\u2019s something weird that\u2019s going on.Then like a clap of thunder, it hit him. He was never there when Barbara went to the clinic for checkups. At first, she told him they were expecting twins. Then the next time it became triplets. The following she told her she was carrying four babies. Then it became five. Paul was beginning to feel like a fool. It was then that the doctor told her about Barbara\u2019s condition.Shocked and StunnedAfter months of joy, excitement, thrill, and preparations, Paul was shocked to the core. They were living under one roof and he never had the slightest idea that Barbara was faking her pregnancy. He saw the signs with his own eyes.From time to time, they took photos and uploaded them on their Facebook page in hopes of getting sponsorship. No one close to them had even suspected that there was no baby at all. At that moment, he became unsure whether there was someone close to them who had the idea that Barbara was lying all along. And then there was one.A Woman\u2019s SkepticismGenevieve Laflamme is the first person to sense that something weird was happening. She recently gave birth to triplets. Although she had some suspicions in her mind, she just can\u2019t barge in and tell Paul. He was too happy and excited.Instead of trusting her intuition, she just convinced herself to believe that Barbara was indeed carrying quintuplets. Moreover, she provided her with tips on where they can get financial support. Genevieve even connected Paul and Barbara to the generous folks who sponsored the diapers for her triplets. Upon learning the news, she quite regretted her decision of keeping silent about her suspicions.Living with LiesPaul was not the only one who was brokenhearted with the news. His parents, relatives, and friends were all shocked as well. Even the friend who helped him set up the Facebook page for sponsorship couldn\u2019t help but get annoyed and disappointed with all of Barbara\u2019s lies.He was so in love and caught up with the idea of becoming a father. He couldn\u2019t think of any reason why the woman she loved and trusted with all his heart would make a fool out of him. Then he found out it was not the first time.Family\u2019s KnowledgeDuring their brief relationship, Paul never had the chance to ask Barbara about her family. All that he knew about his girlfriend was that she was from Quebec as well. Barbara didn\u2019t want to talk about her relatives so he respected her silence.When the hoax came out, a relative of Barbara came forward and told Paul that it was not the first time Barbara fooled people. She had long cut ties with them because of her unusual behavior. They were devastated to know that she did again.Lies in the PastThe relative, who didn\u2019t want to mention his name, told Paul that Barbara had an ex-boyfriend in the past who suffered the same fate as him. She told the man that she was pregnant with twins. Like Paul, the ex-couple had raised funds to prepare for the coming of the babies. But in the end, Barbara\u2019s lies were exposed as well.When Barbara left her hometown, the relatives were pretty sure she will never live in lies again. Her honor had been compromised and she promised them that she will lead a better life. But did Barbara really deserve to be condemned or was she a victim as well.What Barbara Really NeedsAlthough Paul was angry at the deception, his family had talked to him about how to handle his emotions. The doctors were empathetic. In his mind, he was thinking about the friends and sponsors that are all waiting for their announcement. He had plenty of explanations to do.At the hospital, the doctor talked about phantom pregnancy. Based on the explanation, what happened wasn\u2019t totally under Barbara\u2019s control. The woman he loved needs deeper understanding. Moreover, she needs medical attention.What is Phantom Pregnancy?Pseudocyesis or commonly known as phantom pregnancy is a condition wherein a woman convinces herself that she\u2019s actually pregnant. It\u2019s easy to fall trap as the signs and symptoms of a real pregnancy can be seen and experienced.According to WebMD, the exact cause of phantom pregnancy is yet unknown. However, they have found out that the extreme desire of a woman to become pregnant is one of the psychological factors. It even causes changes in the body.

See How The Trick Works.", "context": "Most successful businesses operate by following a fundamental set of core values. Their vision and mission statement reflect these values, the day to day operations are driven by them and they dictate how major decisions are made. Having core values provides a clarity that fosters focus and makes prioritizing easy.As human beings, we all have a personal set of core values that reflect the essence of who we are. We all have them. However having them and consciously allowing them to guide you through life are two entirely different things. Understanding and living a life driven by your own personal values is one of the major keys to success, happiness and inner peace.Write it outThe first step in living a life full of purpose and passion is to write down your own personal values. Your values, though tied to your morals and ethics are not a system of right or wrong. Your personal values are the things you value the most. What drives you? What makes you feel alive, energized and invigorated? Is it love, family, money, career, popularity, serving others, social justice, rescuing animals? The list goes on and on. What do you love? What matters to you?Now that you have identified them\u2013write them down.Why? Research shows that writing down your values yields dozens of positive results such as:You get a true picture of who you really are and what you stand for. To get what you truly want, you must be who you truly are.who you truly are. You will begin to manage your time better. You will learn to make better choices about where you spend your time.about where you spend your time. Knowing and being true to what really matters to you will ignite your passion for your purpose and being able to fulfill your purpose fuels that passion even more. The two are interdependent and keep you motivated and moving forward.Our values are like our internal compass. They keep us headed toward our true north. When we get off course, having them written down helps us notice sooner. Writing about our values helps remind us of where we need to be and it helps us get back on track more easily.Our values are our roots that keep us grounded in what\u2019s important to us. Having them written down visually reminds us to stay true to who we really are.In short, discovering, defining, writing down and living your core values helps to ensure that you get more of the right things done and makes the journey so much more enjoyable.Seeing your personal values in writing reduces stressDr. Kelly McGonigal, Stanford Professor and author of the book The Upside of Stress, has studied the impact that connecting our personal values to our experiences\u2013specifically journaling about the connection\u2013has on our overall health, well-being and ability to cope with stress. According to Dr. McGonigal\u2019s research there are life altering benefits to writing about our personal values:\"In the long term, writing about values has been shown to boost GPAs, reduce doctor visits, improve mental health, and help with everything from weight loss to quitting smoking and reducing drinking. It helps people persevere in the face of discrimination and reduces self-handicapping. In many cases, these benefits are a result of a one-time mindset intervention. People who write about their values once, for ten minutes, show benefits months or even years later.\"McGonigal believes that writing about how the events of our day match up with our deepest personal values can mentally and biologically improve our ability to deal with stress. In the cases she studied she found that:\"Stressful experiences were no longer simply hassles to endure; they became an expression of values... small things that might otherwise have seemed irritating became moments of meaning.\"Putting it in to actionWhen our actions and activities don\u2019t align with our values, we feel less authentic and become demotivated in our daily lives..Below are a few simple steps to assist you in aligning your actions, activities, goals and life purpose with your own unique set of values:Writing it down:Choose the top five (or less) things you value most in life and write them down.Define what each of those values means to YOU.Reflect on your day (or week). What went well? When did you feel stressed? Why?Select one or two highs and one or two stressful events and briefly jot down how they connect to at least one of your core values.Select one or two core values and jot down something you can do the next day (or during the following week) that will positively reflect that value.Self Assessment:As time progresses, keep a tally of how many times you purposefully and intentional engage in activities that positively reflect your value systemAssess your stress levels. Are you feeling more or less stressed/anxious since you began the exercise? How is your passion and motivation? Do you feel driven?Assess your physical well-being. How are you feeling overall? What changes have you noticed (more or less: headaches, neck and back pain, tension, upset stomach. etc.).Plan your action: what can you do to keep this moment going?The most important thing you can do for your personal success today is to not only know your core values, but live them. Allow them to become a part of your day to day life. Write about them and learn to see them in everything you do. A life lined-up with personal values is a well-lived, purpose-filled life.ENDORSED BY Ricky Tang EditorLove this article?", "answers": {"answer_start": [591], "text": ["own personal values"]}, "id": "170016066732231_253737671693403"}, {"question": "The summer's 1st real rom-com's about abortion and fart jokes", "context": "Romantic comedies have become so rare that when the trailer for \"What If\" with Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan premiered last week, Vulture's Amanda Dobbins wrote, \"It looks like someone actually made a rom-com in 2014?\" Indeed, a genre that produced some of the most loved films of all-time -- anything written by Nora Ephron, for instance -- has all but disappeared from the multiplex. This is the world that \"Obvious Child\" enters into on Friday, following six successful months on the festival circuit.\"It is 100 percent made to be a romantic comedy,\" director Gillian Robespierre told HuffPost Entertainment when asked if she would consider her new film part of Hollywood's once-favored genre. \"That's a genre I love, and we just took that style -- boy meets girl -- and put a little twist on it. We messed it up a little bit. I hope people call it a romantic comedy, and I'm proud to have it called that.\"Robespierre \"messed it up a little bit\" by focusing her love story on a stand-up comic named Donna (Jenny Slate) who has a one-night stand, gets pregnant and decides to have an abortion. According to Robespierre, \"Obvious Child\" -- which was first a 2009 short film that also starred Slate -- was created as an answer to films such as \"Knocked Up\" and \"Juno,\" where unexpected pregnancies led to new families. \"They just didn\u2019t feel true,\" Robespierre told the New York Times in a recent interview.\"I'm so neurotic that I'm sure there's backlash out there,\" the director said about her film, which debuted at this year's Sundance Film Festival to near-universal praise. \"Not just from the right, but from people who think scatological jokes are lowbrow or unintelligent and everyone who makes them are boring neanderthals. But! Those people are not fun people. Farts are funny. I think you're kind of a robot if you don't think so. You don't have to love the movie, but you have to love a fart sound.\"Robespierre has such a fondness for fart sounds that she includes one in her movie's meet-cute: Donna's one-night stand, Max (Jake Lacy from \"The Office\"), accidentally farts in her direction while she's squatting to pee in the street. (It later earns him the nickname \"Pee Farter.\")\"I like our movie because I think that it's satisfying in the way that traditional rom-coms are satisfying, but that it's storyline is just more modern and less squeaky clean,\" Slate said. \"But it's not trying to be shocking.\"Slate, 32, is best known for her one-season stint on \"Saturday Night Live,\" guest appearances on \"Bored to Death\" and \"Parks and Recreation\" and Marcel The Shell, a short film that she made with her now-husband, Dean Fleisher-Camp. (According to the actress, plans are still in motion for a Marcel feature film, though nothing is set in stone.) Like Donna, she's a stand-up comic in real life, often performing in Brooklyn.\"When we saw her on stage, before we started working on the short, we felt like she was saying what was going on in our head,\" Robespierre said of finding her lead actress. \"She was so funny and charming, and also beautiful and wearing dresses and very feminine. She was saying everything we thought, and always have been thinking, about our bodies and families and life. It was one of those moments where you wanted her to either be in a movie or be your best friend.\"Playing a stand-up comic was not necessarily difficult for Slate, but she and Robespierre made sure that Donna had her own style.\"She doesn't realize that she doesn't have to put everything out there,\" Slate said. \"She doesn't realize she's spraying the area and some people don't want to be sprayed. But it's also satisfying for her to put everything out there.\"Robespierre structures \"Obvious Child\" around three stand-up routines. The first introduces Donna and her openness with jokes about her then-boyfriend and life views in general. (She is pro-farting, as it turns out.) The second is more of a meltdown, with Donna lashing out after being dumped. The third happens the night before her scheduled abortion procedure.\"That to me was totally alien to me. I wouldn't do that,\" Slate said of the final performance, where Donna reveals to an audience of mostly strangers that she's having an abortion. \"I might do it after the fact. But, in general, I tend to not bring up subjects that seem like hot-button issues in my standup. Because I feel like I have too much of my own personal shit to sort out first, and I don't feel that I'm up for it. I don't feel I have anything very funny to say about big issues. For Donna, she's not talking about a big issue. She's talking about herself. So that I relate to. I relate to her understanding that it is in her nature to be confessional. Her nature is not going to change, even though she has to go through a big experience.\"Slate has been praised for her performance in \"Obvious Child,\" though the plaudits have come in two different forms: Depending on the publication, she's either enjoying a breakout moment or her comeback.\"I don't even think about those things at all. I'm grateful that people are writing about the movie, but I don't walk around with a clear narrative of myself,\" Slate said of the opposing media designations placed upon her this year. \"I literally just think about myself day by day.

Start breaking the rules", "context": "Dear Liz,I am in a happy state of shock because I have two job offers at the same time! I am a recent follower of your job search advice. I've used three pieces of your advice in my job search and that's how I got the two job offers I'm considering now.I was job-hunting for six months and I didn't get even one interview during that time. I completed over 100 online job applications. Even as I was filling out the forms I felt that it was a helpless, useless process. All of the online applications are the same, no matter which company you apply to work for.They all want to know how long you worked at each job and they all ask about your Tasks and Duties. Isn't it obvious from your job title what your Tasks and Duties in the job were?When I started to read your columns I stopped completing online job applications and I started writing Pain Letters instead. I sent out six Pain Letters at first and I got two replies.One was a very nice email from a hiring manager who isn't looking for any help right now (I had not seen a job ad from her company, but I thought the company sounded interesting) and the other reply came from the HR Director in a second company where I'd sent a Pain Letter to the hiring manager.The HR Director, Paula, said that the hiring manager I had reached with my Pain Letter didn't have any job openings but two other managers did. I interviewed with Paula's company and met both managers, and that's where my first job offer came from. The second job offer came from my third batch of Pain Letters.All in all I have sent out seventeen Pain Letters now, I've had six job interviews and I've got two job offers to decide between. I think I am going to take the offer at Paula's company because the people there were both extremely smart and very nice during the entire interview process.I think the culture is healthier there than it is in the other company where I have a job offer. It's a great company too, but why not work in the healthiest place possible?I am 34 years old and I was raised to follow rules. I guess most people were. I have never broken rules  before the way I did in this job search. I guess anybody who got one of my Pain Letters and didn't like it didn't respond to me, and that's perfectly fine.Here are three major pieces of your advice that I followed:I stopped applying for jobs online, and started sending Pain Letters and my Human-Voiced Resume directly to hiring managers, instead. Along the way I got a lot better at using LinkedIn to conduct research!The Definitive Careers Guide From Forbes encompasses every aspect of the job hunt, from interview to promotion. Discover how to get ahead today.I got a consulting business card and started to give it out at networking events. I haven't had any consulting projects yet but I've grown my network a lot and I've also grown my confidence.I stopped being so shy and timid at interviews. No one is going to know what I can do for them unless I tell them. I used my LinkedIn research to get inside the heads of each of my hiring managers, and I'm sure that's why I have two job offers now.The managers who did get back to me weren't the least bit bothered by my direct approach to them. They were glad. They said that it's really  hard to find people to fill their positions. I figured that was true but because we hear so much about talent shortages you start to think that your skills are a dime a dozen.Now I know that's not true. Thanks for your encouragement, Liz!

This number translated to approximately 2.15 shoulder injuries sustained for every 10,000 athlete exposures, which matches up with the approximately 820,700 shoulder injuries reported nationwide during this time period.The athletes experienced shoulder injuries three times more often during games and competitions than during practices.The sport with the highest rate of injuries was boys' football (almost five injuries per 10,000 exposures), while the lowest was girls' soccer (about 0.5 injuries per 10,000 exposures).Only about 8 percent of the injuries required surgery, with almost two thirds of the injuries being either a strain/sprain or a dislocation/separation.About 40 percent of the injured athletes experienced a strain or sprain, and 29 percent experienced a dislocation or separation.While only about 8 percent of the injured athletes ended up having to sit out the season (or their high school career) as a result of their injuries, about 41 percent returned to play within a week.\"Continued prospective surveillance is necessary to monitor injury rates, to gain further information about risk factors leading to shoulder injuries, and ultimately to inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of evidence-based interventions to prevent future shoulder injuries,\" the researchers wrote.This study was published January 13 in the journal Pediatrics. The authors reported no potential conflicts of interest.The research was funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Federation of State High School Association, the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment, DonJoy Orthotics and EyeBlack.", "answers": {"answer_start": [175], "text": ["football"]}, "id": "424419118495051776"}, {"question": "Dick Van Dyke Breaks Political Silence: Defiantly Endorses This Presidential Candidate", "context": "It has been decades since beloved American actor and performer Dick Van Dyke has endorsed a presidential candidate.

The series is easily one of the most popular within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it's pretty easy to imagine Marvel working to complete a full trilogy even if the first sequel is a let (which we certainly don't think it will be). As a result, there is already plenty of anticipation for what could wind up being called Guardians of the Galaxy 3 - but the project has picked up interest from one interesting individual in particular: Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler. The musician/actor recently had the opportunity to have a sizable role in the new indie horror movie Happy Birthday, and it was while sitting down with People magazine that he revealed his interest in being a part of the Marvel family -- specifically out in the cosmos with writer/director James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy. Discussing his feelings about acting post-Happy Birthday and his potential future as an actor, Steven Tyler said, I hope [audiences] enjoy [Happy Birthday]. I know I did! It made me want to do more movies for sure, I would do anything to be in Guardians of the Galaxy 3 -- are you listening James Gunn? Steven Tyler, as mentioned, is best known as the lead singer of Aerosmith, but he does have some acting experience under his belt. In addition to playing himself in movies like Wayne's World 2 and Be Cool, he's also played legitimate roles -- such as in Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express and Epic. Of course, he's also spent time as an American Idol judge, which is a certain level of performance as well. And let's not forget that Tyler already has a family connection within the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well, as his daughter, Liv Tyler, played Betty Ross in The Incredible Hulk. Regardless of his experience and connections, however, whether or not Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 could actually find room for Steven Tyler is a legitimate question. The first film already had a massive ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, John C. Reilly, Michael Rooker and more, and the upcoming sequel is adding to that group with exciting stars like Kurt Russell and Pom Klementieff. I suppose it's possible that Tyler could wind up being given a small but important part -- like the one that Sylvester Stallone will be playing in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.

They use up to 50 percent less energy than conventional lights. And the lifetime of LED lights is two to four times that of older, non-LED lights, which means lower maintenance costs for cities that need to change a street\u2019s lightbulbs when they go out.But the bottom line from the AMA is that high-intensity LED streetlights that emit too much blue light can actually throw off sleep patterns of the people living in those neighborhoods and make nighttime glare on roads worse than conventional lights.\"Despite the energy efficiency benefits, some LED lights are harmful when used as street lighting,\" Maya A. Babu, an AMA board member, said in press release.None of the authors of the AMA recommendations were answering questions on the topic, according to the press office.'A Strip Mall In Outer Space'\"It feels like I\u2019m in a strip mall in outer space,\" Brooklyn resident Jolanta Benal told The New York Times last year, complaining about the bright LED streetlights in her Windsor Terrace neighborhood.New York City is spending $75 million to retrofit its more than 250,000 street lights to be energy-efficient LEDs, the Times reported. The new lights are expected to save the city $6 million in energy costs and $8 million in maintenance each year.But lights like these could also be costing residents like Benal a lot of sleep.The retrofitted streetlights were designed to prevent glare, according to a spokesperson for the city's Department of Transportation. But the current blue light allowance for the new street lights is higher than the new AMA recommendations call for.\"The problem is that if people are not exposed to darkness in the evening then they have a problem going to sleep,\" Maurice Ohayon, director of the Stanford Sleep Epidemiology Research Center, told The Huffington Post.Ohayon and his colleagues recently looked at the sleep habits and sleep quality of more than 15,800 people. They found that people who were exposed to more nighttime light were nearly twice as likely to be dissatisfied with their sleep as those living in areas with less light. Those exposed to more light at night also reported sleeping less at night and having more fatigue during the day.If people are not exposed to darkness in the evening then they have a problem going to sleep. Maurice Ohayon, Stanford UniversityAs that exposure to light happens over and over again, our circadian rhythms (the body\u2019s internal clock) get disrupted. And beyond affecting sleep, disordered circadian rhythms are linked to higher rates of chronic diseases, including obesity, heart disease, depression and some cancers.In the same way that blue light from a smartphone or computer screen suppresses melatonin production in the brain (the body\u2019s signal for sleep), it's the blue light in LEDs that causes trouble, Clete Kushida, a neurologist and sleep specialist at Stanford Sleep Medicine Center, explained in a KBCW video.Blame Light Color And IntensityThere is actually no such thing as a \"white\" LED light, Stephen Quick, an architect and urban designer, told HuffPost.LED lights that appear white, like the ones used in streetlights are made up of a combination of amber, red, green and blue light, said Quick, an adjunct professor of architecture at Carnegie Mellon University who was not involved in writing the AMA's recommendations.Quick and his colleagues took a deep dive into the research on cost-saving benefits and potential health, safety and aesthetic concerns of LED lights for a report for the city of Pittsburgh in 2011. The report was used to help Pittsburgh finalize its plan to replace its 40,000 streetlights.That research, like the new AMA recommendation, suggested that a neutral color light with about an even mix of blue and the other colors be used for streetlights, Quick said. \"Think incandescent light -- neither warm nor cool [in color]. It\u2019s soft, but it doesn\u2019t have the cool qualities that you\u2019d see in a fluorescent light.\"Quick said that the Pittsburgh report's recommendations did allow for slightly more blue light than the AMA.Brighter But Not SaferThe other potential problem with LED streetlights that are too bright, according to the AMA\u2019s recommendation against them, is glare.\"A lot of people believe that the brighter the lights, the safer they are,\" Quick said.But LED light is directional -- meaning it gets emitted in a specific direction, unlike conventional lightbulbs, which put out light and heat in all directions.When the lights are lower consistently, we don\u2019t have the glare problem we do when they\u2019re really bright. Stephen Quick, Carnegie Mellon UniversityBecause the light is not diffused, LEDs create a \"glare zone\" for drivers at certain angles that can be worse than conventional streetlights, Quick said.The new AMA recommendations encourage \"proper design, shielding and installation\" to help mitigate glare.Quick also said that dimming the lights would help reduce glare. \"The higher the intensity, the more glare from the bounced light or the direct light,\" he said. \"And when the lights are lower consistently, we don\u2019t have the glare problem we do when they\u2019re really bright.\"The Cost Of Evolving StandardsThe AMA's new recommendations may call for some rethinking of current green building standards and projects.The U.S. Green Building Council -- the group that runs LEED, the most widely used green building certification program in the world -- does not support one specific type of streetlight over another, Theresa Backhaus, a site technical specialist for LEED, told HuffPost via email.\"We encourage lighting design to take all considerations into account for the health, safety and welfare of people and the environment,\" she said.USGBC's Light Pollution Reduction Credit was created precisely to reduce the harmful effects of light pollution, she said. The credit is one that buildings and development projects can meet to earn one of LEED's four rating levels.That credit requires projects to use lower lighting levels for \"sensitive areas,\" such as residential zones and nature preserves, but does not specify a limit on the amount of blue light that can be used.The good news is that most LEDs, especially newer ones, are made with dimming controls, Quick said -- so the intensity of the light can be adjusted fairly easily.Changing the color balance of the lights can be a lot more difficult.Sometimes it's possible to replace just the LED themselves, Quick said, but sometimes the whole fixture needs to be replaced. \"And that gets costly.\"The takeaway is that there\u2019s nothing inherently bad about the LED lights themselves. \"We save a tremendous amount of energy by using them. We also save a lot of money in maintenance costs,\" Quick said.But getting the color and intensity right is important. \"The best procedure right now is for cities to be cautious and know what they\u2019re buying,\" he added.", "answers": {"answer_start": [872], "text": ["high-intensity LED streetlights"]}, "id": "1093444104031880_1127228060653484"}, {"question": "The World\u2019s Most Popular Birth Control Method May Surprise You", "context": "When you think of contraception, it\u2019s likely that condoms and the birth control pill first come to mind.

That is to say: The majority of partnered women around the world now use some form of contraceptive. These numbers are much less encouraging among the least developed countries, where that number drops to just 40 percent. In Africa, it is just 33 percent. At the opposite end of the spectrum is China, which only this year ended its infamous one-child policy, with 84 percent of women using contraception. Close behind is Northern Europe, with 77 percent, and North and South America, with 75 percent each.In the coming decades, those numbers are expected to shoot up.

(Though there is a 1.8 percent difference, the statistics do have margins of error, and methods of compiling them are often revised, so this dip does not necessarily mean there has been a long-term decline in mental illness.)The SAMHSA paper comes amid increasing scrutiny of the ability of America\u2019s health care system to handle issues of mental illness. For example, the American Mental Health Counselors Association released a study earlier this week claiming that adults with mental illness who live in those states electing against expanding Medicaid under Obamacare will be denied insurance. According to the study, care could be denied to up to 4 million patients.The SAMHSA study breaks down mental illness rates by state. Perhaps surprisingly, New Jersey had the lowest national rates of overall and severe mental illness \u2013 14.7 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively.The states with the most mental illness?In Utah, 22.3 percent of the adult population experienced mental illness, and in West Virginia had the most cases of severe mental illness among adults, at 5.5 percent.It may be tempting to look at the map that accompanies the study and try to make guesses at why, say, the Pacific Northwest and the Midwest seem to suffer more from mental illness than other regions. However, because there is so much mental health illness in all the states \u2013 and lots of uncontrolled variables \u2013 it would be hard to draw any real conclusions. According to the study, \"factors that potentially contribute to the variation are not well understood and need further study.\"Not all psychiatric statisticians are satisfied with SAMHSA\u2019s findings, with some alleging that the agency grossly understates the prevalence of mental illness.Ronald Kessler, McNeil Family Professor of Health Care at Harvard and expert in large scale mental illness surveys, tells Newsweek that SAMHSA\u2019s assessment of serious mental illness is \"pretty good\" but that he believes that the \"prevalence for any mental illness is too low.\"Kessler, who is familiar with SAMHSA\u2019s computational methods, said that the agency did not measure all of the ailments in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -- including some major ones like attention deficit disorder.\"I find it objectionable that they use this term \u2018any mental illness,\u2019\" he says. \"What they really mean is any mental illness that they decided to measure. What they ask about is anxiety and depression and drinking and drugs, but there are many things beside that they totally ignored.\"\u2019Kessler estimates that the prevalence of mental illness might range from 25 to 30 percent of American adults. A 2011 report published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pegs the number at 25 percent.SAMHSA\u2019s statistics division disagrees with Kessler\u2019s assessment.\"This captures the majority of people suffering from mental illness in the country,\" Dr. Kevin Hennessy, deputy director of the Center for Behavioral Health and Statistics and Quality, tells Newsweek.

Carriers vary in their processes though generally, an airline will overbook in order to offset the perceived likelihood of no-shows.Federal rules dictate a carrier must first check whether anyone is willing to voluntarily give up their seat before then bumping flyers involuntarily if nobody comes forward.United CEO Oscar Munoz claimed the airline company \"followed established procedures\" when aviation police removed a \"disruptive and belligerent\" passenger from the plane. The airline, owned by United Continental Holdings (NYSE: UAL), said in a statement that the flight had been overbooked.\"Overbooking is a necessity for airlines due to different levels of no show passengers experienced on different routes. It's normally a highly sophisticated process based on extensive detailed statistical analysis,\" John Strickland, an aviation expert and director at JLS Consulting, told CNBC in an email.\"Even when passengers are forcibly denied boarding the idea is to handle this as tactfully & sensitively as possible,\" Strickland added.In the case of the United Express flight 3411 from Chicago to Louisville on Sunday, four crew members were required to board the plane in order to work from Louisville the following day.While it is customary for airlines to negotiate the number of passengers on board a flight, analysts suggested it was unusual such protocol took place after everyone had boarded the plane.Audra Bridges, a witness who posted the video to her Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) page Sunday evening, said United management came on board the flight and used a computer to randomly select four passengers who would then be removed from that trip.

The public markets that date back to the early days of the colonies were important both for trade and keeping people fed. More recently, in the birth of the modern farmers market movement more than 40 years ago, antihunger groups played a key role. In the early 1970s, the direct retail sale of fruits and vegetables by farmers was illegal in California, and the first modern farmers markets in the state opened in 1979, after the then-and-again governor, Jerry Brown, signed the Direct Marketing Act, allowing growers to sell directly to consumers. The first market in Southern California opened in the parking lot of a church in Gardena, a diverse city in the South Bay of Los Angeles County. The market was sponsored by the Interfaith Hunger Coalition, part of the Southern California Ecumenical Council, and was intended to bring the blue-collar city fresh, healthy fruits and vegetables at affordable prices. The coalition expanded into four other communities the following year.Spreading widely and wildly throughout California and across the country over the succeeding decades, farmers markets have drifted somewhat from their antihunger roots. As humorist Clare Doody wrote for The Washington Post last year, everyone who shops at the farmers market has \"already done yoga that morning. Yet somehow they didn\u2019t sweat; their topknot still looks good and they\u2019ve got on a great scarf. And don\u2019t get me started on the women.\" Every paragraph of her piece begins \"I don\u2019t like farmers markets because...\" It\u2019s satire, sure, but it hits close to the experience of shopping the Wednesday-morning market in downtown Santa Monica\u2014where no one appears to have a day job, everyone is an actor/model/DJ, and, yes, they just came from yoga.Last week, however, the Los Angeles City Council passed a measure that will reconnect the city\u2019s 57 markets with their antihunger roots\u2014and further advance a national movement to leverage farmers markets to help increase food access for poor Americans. The measure, which received unanimous support, will require that every farmers market in the city accept Electronic Benefits Transfer cards, which are used to redeem food stamp benefits. Last summer, the Los Angeles Food Policy Council, which lobbied for the measure, found that half the city\u2019s markets either didn\u2019t accept EBT or couldn\u2019t be confirmed as accepting it.Vance Corum, who helped open that first market in Gardena, said, \"The decision by the council to require all markets to accept EBT is the most positive thing the city can do\" to provide equal access to farmers markets.\"We lost a lot of poor people who were coming to farmers markets,\" continued Corum, who runs the Washington state\u2013based nonprofit Farmers\u2019 Markets America. \"Now we\u2019ve built them back to some extent, and we\u2019ll continue to see some bright light at the end of the tunnel, where people of all ethnicities, all income levels, will have some form of access.\"The largely white and middle-class local food movement, which spurred the popularity of farmers markets, is not to blame for that loss. Rather, changes to how federal benefits were distributed cut Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients off from the resource. Between 1994 and 2013, the number of farmers markets nationwide has increased from fewer than 2,000 to 8,144, \"thereby potentially increasing access to farm products for nutrition assistance program participants,\" according to a USDA report. In 1994, just over a quarter of markets accepted food stamps, which were then redeemed with paper vouchers. As the nutrition assistance program switched over to EBT cards in the early 2000s, the ability for cash-based farmers markets to accept food stamps declined sharply, hitting just 8 percent of all markets in 2004. But managers of farmers markets and their vendors have been catching up. As of 2011, more than a third of markets accepted benefits, and the share has continued to increase.The Los Angeles ordinance will further increase that figure. To prevent vendors from spending so they can accept plastic, managers at each market will be required to have an EBT point-of-sale machine (provided for free by the state) that will allow SNAP recipients to debit their cards and receive scrips or tokens representing the equivalent amount of cash. Customers can then spend the scrips with vendors, who can redeem them for cash or another form of payment from the market operators at the end of the day.The scrip can go a lot further at the farmers market than you might imagine. A number of regional price-comparison studies of farmers markets and grocery stores have found that buying direct costs roughly the same, and sometimes even less, than shopping at a supermarket. One study conducted in Vermont found that buying organic items from the farmers market was less expensive in every instance than buying from the store. That\u2019s not to say that some farmers market items aren\u2019t exorbitantly expensive. As Michel Nischan of Wholesome Wave said, \"People will fixate on the $5-a-pound heirloom tomato, but they will not fixate on the 80-cents-a-pound kohlrabi.\" That same tomato might cost a dollar or two a pound when it\u2019s a little past its prime and perfect for making sauce.Nischan\u2019s work at Wholesome Wave is dedicated to making SNAP scrips go twice as far by expanding market-match programs, which incentivize food stamp recipients to shop at farmers markets by matching the amount they spend with an EBT card. Local programs around the country provide such matching funds, and Nischan\u2019s organization was able to get federal funds supporting market-match programs included in the 2014 farm bill. Last year, California received a $3.7 million grant to expand market match in the state. While having an EBT machine at a farmers market can help bring in new customers, those with market-match programs see even larger increases in business. According to Nischan, markets that add a doubling program can see a 38 percent jump in overall sales compared with when they accepted EBT.\"What we\u2019ve seen is that little bit of incentive\u2014it can just be a $5 doubling or a $10 doubling\u2014it changes the way these SNAP consumers spend the rest of their SNAP dollars,\" Nischan said. \"You give these families an extra $10 a week, and they move mountains with it.\"Los Angeles City Councilmember Mitch O\u2019Farrell mentioned the possibility of expanding market-match programs in Los Angeles as a potential step beyond the EBT ordinance. But according to a study released Tuesday on farmers markets in South Los Angeles, the market-match programs available aren\u2019t connecting with residents in parts of the city where food access is the poorest and rates of diet-related disease are the highest. According to a Community Health Councils report, more than 80 percent of nearly 500 consumers surveyed were not aware of market match. Furthermore, there simply are not enough markets serving communities in South Los Angeles, according to Gwendolyn Flynn, CHC\u2019s policy director of nutrition resources development\u2014and the perception remains that not all residents are welcome at those markets that do exist in poor, diverse communities.\"The support of the city council, with their vote, was tremendous in helping to dispel this notion that this was for a few people\u2014no, it\u2019s for everybody,\" she said. Low-income shoppers have felt that \"farmers markets were kind of elitist\u2014and that\u2019s not the case.\"Some organizers see farmers markets as an alternative to the long-flagging efforts to bring grocery stores and other food retailers into neighborhoods that have historically lacked access. But Flynn is hoping for more dynamic, more diverse solutions\u2014not only to the diet-related problems that neighborhoods are facing but to the lack of jobs and economic opportunity as well.\"Having farmers markets shouldn\u2019t preclude us from having supermarkets and grocery stores and community gardens and other forms of urban agriculture,\" she said.But, as Nischan said, \"frankly, from an economic perspective, when you talk about making food access a quick reality, it\u2019s a lot cheaper to open a four-, five-, or six-vendor market\" than to open a grocery store. \"If I were a grocery store owner, I wouldn\u2019t do it either,\" he said, referring to opening a location in a low-income neighborhood.Flynn contends that bringing more food access across the board, from grocery stores that hire hundreds of workers to community gardens that reduce blight and provide opportunities for civic engagement, \"would help to reinvigorate and stimulate these local economies and in the long run would contribute to the health outcomes in communities like South Los Angeles.\"That kind of broad-based neighborhood change, in part driven by farmers markets, has happened before\u2014to a degree. For example, in the early days of the Hollywood Farmers Market, \"Hollywood was a little bit of a rough neighborhood, so we were looking for a social impact related to many things,\" said James Haydu, the executive director of SEE-LA, which operates markets across Los Angeles. Not only did the market sell food to residents and area restaurants, but it used public space, got people out into the street interacting with one another, and helped to support California farmers.Santa Monica was also a far different place in the early 1980s, when its famed downtown market made its debut, from what it is today, with its many post-yoga-class actors.", "answers": {"answer_start": [2331], "text": ["food stamp benefits"]}, "id": "4k3spp"}, {"question": "The Finest Beach is Found at the Tail-end of the Philippines", "context": "Every summer, we are constantly on the look out for new destinations to explore. Besides, of all the 7,641 Philippine Islands, only a handfull are generally considered as established tourist destinations. This includes the island province of Palawan. After earning the most coveted spot as the \"World Best Island\" for 2 consecutive years, truck loads of tourists have made this their destination of choice, leading to the overnight fame of 3 of its major attractions: Puerto Princesa, El Nido and Coron. However, as how the saying goes \"save the best for last,\" Palawan\u2019s finest set of islands is hidden far away from the bustling crowd of Central and Northern Palawan and is found at the southern tip of this elongated landmass. The Balabac Archipelago is a group of 31 islands found at the very tip of the Palawan Province. It\u2019s a collection of islets, atolls and sand bars, of which Onuk Island is said to be the best, most beautiful, most coveted and yet the most elusive island.To get here, one needs to travel to Rio Tuba town from Puerto Princesa, a good 4-hour drive and another 4 hours by boat going to Balabac town from Rio Tuba. Balabac town is still in its purest and untouched form, therefore, accommodations are very basic. From basic to \"roughing it,\" lodging are available in Balabac town and Punta Sebaring Island.From Balabac town, iHAPer must take another 2.5 hour scenic boat ride before reaching the paradise called Onuk island. The boat ride can be very calm to rough depending on the time of the day and weather, however, one can witness an otherworldly change of water color from dark blue, light blue to crystal clear white as the island gets closer.Once the island is reached a blinding white sandy shore welcomes travellers, while a rustic-looking wharf and cottages on stilts is easily noticeable from the approaching boat.The island of Onuk is blessed with immense beauty. Here, one will find probably the whitest and finest sand, comparable to that of talcum powder; a patch of lush vegetation at the center of the island; nesting sea turtles that come back to the island to lay their eggs; and the healthiest corals, where giant Taclobo clams, Nemo, Dory and other types of fish swim in abundance. To top it all, a view of the mountain range of Sabah, Malaysia is surprisingly visible on the southern horizon of the island.Travel PointersAccessing the Island is quite tricky, not because of it\u2019s location but because of the permit that any potential visitor has to request for to visit the island. The Island of Onuk is owned by the Mayor of Balabac, Palawan and any request to visit the island must be coordinated with the LGU of Balabac. Based on the experience of the group of travel blogger Chyng Reyes, permits are only issued, a day before the visit, so an alternate plan to visit other islands of Balabac must be in place as a back up.It is also highly suggested to have a reliable boatman since the town is fairly new in catering to incoming visitors.

How did it all begin? Is there purpose to our existence? Wait, what are those little holes in airplane windows?Thanks to the curious mind of Robbie Gonzalez from io9 , the latter of those questions might be answered. After finding no sturdy answer on internet forums, he decided to track down a copy of a maintenance manual for the Boeing 737 on Wikileaks and contact Marlowe Moncur, Director of Technology for GKN Aerospace, the world leader in passenger cabin window design development.As you might have already guessed, it\u2019s to do with regulating pressure.He found that most cabin windows consist of outer, middle and inner panes \u2013 all of which are made of a superstrong synthetic resin. Typically, it\u2019s the middle pane that has the mysterious little hole.Only the outer and middle panes are actually structural, while the inner is pretty much there as failsafe and to protect the other layers. Moncur said it\u2019s only there to maintain cabin pressure in the extremely rare event that the outer pane becomes fractured.Cruising at 10,600 meters (35,000 feet), the pressure is around 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) per square inch. This is too low for the human body to stay conscious, so the pressure is artificially maintained at around 3.5 kilograms (8 pounds) per square inch. But of course, if you increase pressure inside, the structure has to be strong to hold the difference between the external pressure and internal pressure.The outer pane is the thickest of these and is the primary layer that bears the pressure of the cabin. According to Gonzalez, the little hole is there to act as \"as a bleed valve, allowing pressure between the air in the passenger cabin and the air between the outer and middle panes to equilibrate.\" Simply put, it ensures that only the strongest outer pane is bearing the pressure, leaving the middle pane available in case of an emergency.Phew, now that problem\u2019s solved, go work on creating lasting nuclear fusion .Main image credit: Chris Waits/Flickr.

What's more, a Peruvian ship worker also asked us, \"Is that your daughter? But she looks like a China woman!\" And a presumably respectful Southern gentleman asked me, after seeing me with my parents, if I was \"like a Cambodian victim of sex trafficking?\"That one was really the cherry on top of my Pin\u0303a Colada.These questions are all particularly anathema to me because I actually write for a living about the global subjugation of women. So I am very certain that I'm not my dad's mail-order Asian bride and that my mom is not my sex trafficking captor.My parents, who are 61 years old, white and live in Iowa, adopted me from Seoul, South Korea after I was left on the doorsteps of an orphanage when I was a day old. I'm not a unique case -- after the Korean War ended in 1953, many moms in South Korea abandoned their newborns in a society that would ostracize an unwed woman who had a child.There are complex stereotypes regarding race, gender, prejudice, and privilege that arise when people ask us whether we are married -- namely the inculcated archetype regarding the \"creepy\" older white man man and the younger, submissive Asian woman.Society's view on this is simply not something I want to be reminded of when I'm hanging out with my dad.I'm not saying I'm free of my own biases or I adhere to some supreme level of moral rectitude, but since it's National Adoption Awareness Month (granted, it's domestic-focused) and this type of prejudice is not endemic to a cruise ship but rather something that happens to many Asian adoptees, I thought I'd make a small request. I think it'd be best, guys, if we could stop labeling and perpetuating stereotypes because, well, just look at what happens: awkwardness for everyone involved.My sister-in-law, dad, brother, cutest nephew ever, mom, me.Now, it might seem easy to attribute these statements to the \"type\" of people who go on this \"type\" of vacation.A cruise is, of course, probably about the least authentic way to travel. There is no farm-to-table fare, no architecture steeped in history. The completely curated activities and cheesy over-the-top theatrical tone of a cruise relegates it to steerage in the ranks of traveling. Fine, but it is a fun vacation for families. Plus, I was veritably unable to check email for a week, so I had a great time.But I will say this cruise I went on was not prototypical. On board, we mostly hung out in an unassuming whiskey lounge with dark wood and went to shows and a classy-enough art auction. The cruise left from a port in New York and was a week-long home to an eclectic mix of socioeconomic statuses and races. Old-money-Upper-East-Siders complained about how the food was \"teahrible.\" Russian families three generations strong ate Japanese teppanyaki with precocious daughters looking squarely in their parent's eyes telling them \"Nyet\" (No). Italian women loudly compared their commutes from Staten Island into the city. And a largely Filipino and Peruvian boat crew told me about the new food they ate on the boat -- like spaghetti carbonara.But as I describe these passengers above, it's clear I'm just as prone to stereotyping others as anyone else is. And these subtle, nuanced observations can be more insidious than overtly offensive statements such as racial slurs -- which are vivid and salient in their wrongness. These more latent forms of bias can slowly build undetected. Creating awareness and actively trying not to do this takes work.To be sure, this post isn't some culturally elitist screed meant to elicit comments like \"'Murica, fu*k yeah.\" This is no uproarious David Foster Wallace piece, \"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again,\" in which he derisively mocks the low-brow nature of a cruise he took with statements such as, \"I have seen 500 upscale Americans dance the Electric Slide. I have seen sunsets that looked computer-enhanced. I have (very briefly) joined a conga line.\"All of this caused him to basically have an existential crisis. I guess I can be thankful all that didn't happen to me.I am actually pointing out that on this racially diverse boat, people from all over the world projected stereotypes toward Asian women and white men.Ever one to lighten the mood, my hilarious, intelligent mom said, \"Well, what if you and I are an item, and Dad is just the beard?\"But that would simply never happen because that's not a social construct society has formed a consensus on.When I was younger, I wanted to go places strictly with my dad, because he had brown hair and I thought I resembled him more than my strawberry-blonde mom. As a Korean adoptee in a homogenous Midwest community, I thought I blended in more this way. Now, the reality is that the opposite is true.The cruise isn't the first time something like this has happened. A few years ago, I lived with my parents outside of Chicago when I was in grad school for journalism. My dad and I were at some event and I was producing a radio segment, when a local politician -- you know, those public figures in whom we place all our trust -- asked if my dad and I were married. I remember neighbors asking, too. It's just uncomfortable.But beyond being uncomfortable, these questions are also distressing because they bring up issues from childhood that have shaped who you are. It's a reminder of feeling like an outsider and wanting to fit in. And it's a reminder that you probably overcompensate because of it. It's a reminder that growing up and not seeing anyone who looks like you can make you dislike or be disinterested in your own ethnicity. It's a reminder that you realized -- early on in life -- that the world is such an imperfect place that a mother could be forced to give up her child. And that is all personally painful to think about.But it all also probably made you more of a soul-searcher.Nicole Soojung recently wrote for Bitch Magazine about whether race should be discussed among adoptees, pointing out that some parents opt for a \"colorblind\" approach. She said that a mother who adopted a son told her: \"I don't see my son's color. Race is just not an issue for us.\"But race in relation to adoption is an issue, precisely for reasons like what happened on our cruise.

Though the narrative of acorn-fattened pigs roaming the woodlands of western Spain is popular, it appears to be a misleading one: Most ibe1rico pigs spend their short, unremarkable lives slopping up provender on factory farms.Since the price and quality of jamon iberico vary widely\u2014high-end examples can fetch more than $200 a pound\u2014Spain\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture rolled out designations a few years back that minimize the guesswork. White, green, and red tags denote pork that\u2019s typically mixed-breed and frequently fed with grain, not acorns. Purebred, acorn-fed iberico pigs are tagged with black labels.Outside the Iberian Peninsula, where shoppers are less conversant in Spanish ham-speak, the color-coded tags will likely prove useful. Roughly 20,000 tons of the black-hoofed hams were exported last year alone, up 25 percent from the year before. Eighty percent of exported iberico goes to EU countries such as Germany, Italy, Portugal, and France. Japan, the U.S., and Mexico make up the majority of the remaining 20 percent. But there is a movement in the U.S. to develop its own American versions of the world's most exclusive cured meat. Acornseekers, based in Flatonia, Texas, was the first to bring Iberico pigs, a breed indigenous to Spain and Portugal, to the U.S. for commercial production. La Quercia, an Iowa-based farm that sells its pork to high-end shops such as Eataly and Murray's in New York, has its own \"acorn proscuitto,\" made from nut-foraging Missouri Tamworth pigs. And on Feb. 5, Georgia-based  White Oak Pastures held a dinner to celebrate its first harvest\u2014featuring its pigs flown in from the dehesa savannas in southwest Spain\u2014and included chefs from Spain who led the preparations.Compared with conventional hogs, the indigenous Iberian species matures far more slowly, bears smaller litters, yields less meat, and requires vast swaths of acorn-rich pastureland (the Spanish government mandates at least five acres per animal). Which is why, according to the Asociacion Nacional de Industria de Carne de Espan\u0303a, the largest association representing the Spanish meat industry, 95 percent of jamon labeled as iberico is actually mixed-breed. And why authentic jamon iberico is so much pricier.With that in mind, here are five questions to ask before your next jamon purchase if you\u2019re seeking quality over price, whether traditional Spanish or the newest American offerings: Breed: Was the pig pure-breed or mixed?Diet: Was it fed wild acorns or industrial fodder?Lifestyle: Was it free-range or farmed?Curing: Was it three years (the minimum for pure-breed iberico) or 700 days (the minimum for cross-breed)?Lifespan: Did the pig enjoy one or two years of grazing? If the latter, it leads to a more complex final product.Avelino Garcia, a bespectacled charcutero who\u2019s been carving ham in Madrid\u2019s Pacifico market since 1970, said his customers spring for the acorn-fed stuff on holidays and special occasions only, for the most part. \"Sure, we\u2019ve come a long way since the dime-a-dozen chorizo sandwiches of the Franco era, but jamon iberico will always be a luxury product.\"Corrects second-to-last paragraph about the curing process", "answers": {"answer_start": [66], "text": ["jamon iberico"]}, "id": "830307019513028608"}, {"question": "Kid's solution to the ethical trolley dilemma", "context": "Kid's solution to the ethical trolley dilemma | everyone dies", "answers": {"answer_start": [48], "text": ["everyone dies"]}, "id": "519x2b"}, {"question": "This just might be the biggest travel bummer ever", "context": "If you've ever traveled far and long to see a famous monument, you know it's an exciting experience.

Researchers at North Carolina State University found that the number of people who supported a project on Kickstarter \u2014 rather than how much money the project raked in \u2014 was the real indicator of whether a product would succeed. The study, published this month in the journal Research Policy, followed 1,000 successful Kickstarter campaigns in technology, product design, hardware and video games. All participants who responded raised at least $10,000 from an average of 1,078 backers. SEE ALSO: 3.5 million people supported Kickstarter projects in 2016\"The first key finding was that the amount of money a crowdfunding entrepreneur raised was inconsequential to their product\u2019s ultimate success in the market,\" lead researcher Michael Stanko said in a statement. For one, raising a lot more money didn't make founders any more likely to meet their goals for sales or profit once they entered the marketplace. That was because the difference in funding wasn't enough to help founders spend more on advertising or do anything else that would actually translate into more sales.Beyond that, raising extra money indicated that founders started to lose focus and stop innovating on bigger ideas. Faced with the pressure of a massively successful Kickstarter campaign, founders started to get slightly overwhelmed.

Maybe a job driving the Big Idaho Potato Truck is the career you\u2019ve been looking for.The promotional vehicle, which consists of a semi cab hauling a 12-foot-tall replica potato, travels around the United States to draw attention to the prize spuds of Idaho. Operated by the Idaho Potato Commission, the truck is currently on its fifth annual tour of the country. Funding concerns mean this could be the last year, but a recent, unexpected endorsement from Kobe Bryant\u2014he name-dropped the truck in an ESPN interview\u2014may have helped secure its future.To find out what life on the road with the Big Potato is really like we spoke with Larry Bathe, who is not only the current driver of the trailer, but has been with the project since the very beginning.The Big Idaho Potato Truck first hit the road in 2012, as a promotional tour commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Idaho Potato Commission. As Bathe told us, the idea for the truck came from Linda Kaufman of marketing company Foerstel Design, who was inspired by an old novelty postcard that showed an impossibly massive potato on the back of a flatbed.Bathe, a lifelong truck driver, was brought in to help figure out exactly how to create and pilot a giant potato around the country. Originally, the huge tater was set to be 16 feet tall, and hold a museum inside, but at that scale it wouldn\u2019t have fit under most bridges. The potato creators scaled the tater back to its current 12-foot-tall size, and began to test drive it, which is when Bathe first took the wheel.The truck did its first nine-month tour in 2012, mostly visiting grocery stores to hand out information on Idaho spuds. That was supposed to be the extent of its service celebrating the Potato Commission\u2019s anniversary, but the vehicle proved so popular that it was allowed to hit the road again in 2013. More and more venues began requesting that the truck make an appearance, from Nascar events to the Kentucky Derby. After the Big Idaho Potato Truck\u2019s second tour it had gained so much notice that the program was given a three-year contract, 2016 being its final guaranteed year.\"Some people love it in the commission, and some people don\u2019t, or at least they act like they don\u2019t,\" says Bathe. \"But in the end we win them over pretty easily.\" Despite yearly funding worries, the Big Idaho Potato Truck continues chugging along. Having turned down the first two tours to be with his family, Bathe returned to the truck tour in 2014. He has driven the potato every year since.According to Bathe, driving around with the heavy carb load is both challenging and rewarding. The potato is 12 feet wide and 28 feet long, making it nearly impossible to see what\u2019s directly behind it. \"It\u2019s difficult for mirrors to see behind it, so I don\u2019t have an idea of the traffic pattern [behind the truck],\" says Bathe. Turning the huge tater is also a challenge, that Bathe nearly always has to navigate by instinct and experience.But the driver of the Big Idaho Potato Truck is not alone. There are also two other \"ambassadors\" on board who look after the logistics of the tour. In addition to the responsibility to interact with the public that each of the potato team shares, one of the ambassadors takes care of photography, video, and other documentation, while the other looks after social media and managing the venues and locations. It takes a team to drive a six-ton potato.All three of the team ride in the cab while they are on the road, but the Big Potato itself isn\u2019t empty. \"You can\u2019t have something that can\u2019t be inspected inside, be as big as that potato,\" says Bathe. To allow for this, there is a door in the potato that leads to the hollow insides which have been fitted with shelves and lockers for the potato team to store their stuff.Even with the close quarters and the challenges of driving a giant potato around, Bathe loves his gig. \"The amount of people that wave at you every day when you\u2019re driving the Big Idaho Potato is just outrageous,\" he says. \"I get thumbs up, waves, people taking pictures. It\u2019s just a feel-good job.\"Since each year could possibly be the last for the truck, its overseers have ended up filling the positions last minute. But Bathe hopes that this will change as the popularity of the Big Potato Truck grows, along with its crew.

Today the study has resurfaced as researchers extend upon the original findings by looking deeper into the possible biological basis of homosexuality.Published in New Scientist magazine, the 2006 study was conducted by sexologist Anthony Bogaert, a Community Health Sciences chair and professor at Ontario's Brock University. His research led him to conclude that having more older brothers makes it more likely a man will be gay. Each older brother raises the odds of homosexuality by a third, potentially going from a 3 percent chance with the first son to a 6 percent chance with the fourth.Bogaert studied 944 gay and straight men, including some who were raised with non-biological male siblings, to pit prenatal against postnatal factors. His research, which reappeared in a Sept. 4 New Scientist article, ultimately determined that fraternal birth order seems to have a connection to sexual orientation. \"That means for each male gestation that occurs, something changes in a woman\u2019s body that makes her more likely to give birth to a gay son,\" as Brock University explains Bogaert's findings.An abstract from the study, published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, summarizes the research:Only biological older brothers, and not any other sibling characteristic, including nonbiological older brothers, predicted men\u2019s sexual orientation, regardless of the amount of time reared with these siblings. These results strongly suggest a prenatal origin to the fraternal birth-order effect.Today, Bogaert is looking to determine that prenatal origin.\"[The 2006 study] was an important study and it does suggest there is probably a biological basis to the older brother effect,\" he told The Huffington Post during a phone conversation from Canada Thursday afternoon. \"It's an important study in the context of sex orientation development. We have additional research going on right now testing specifically the underlying biological effect of the older brother. ... There are no results yet. We are collecting samples of mothers of gay men and comparing them to mothers of heterosexual men and looking to see if there is evidence of a biological factor that differs between the two groups.\"Bogaert explained that the 2006 study never determined a specific \"mechanism\" -- a biological factor or process -- behind the older brother effect. He suggested this mechanism could be a maternal immune response, a hormone change in the womb, a gestational factor during pregnancy or even genes.\"The 2006 study really strongly suggests that there is biological mechanism but it never really tested the specific mechanism itself in terms of determining what factor is in fact influencing a change in a mother's development during pregnancy,\" he explained to HuffPost. \"What we're doing now is we're looking at the specific mechanism and seeing if we can find evidence for that. We have a study looking at ... mothers of gay and heterosexual men and seeing if there is a maternal immune response. So, that's something very unique and new.\"Bogaert says that isolating the exact biological mechanism or process will support the \"nature\" side of the Nature v. Nurture debate. If successful, his new research could provide a biological backing for homosexuality.\"I think there's strong evidence that people who believe that there's a biological basis to sexual orientation tend to be more tolerant to sexual minorities, and that's one of the more positive [possible] social outcomes,\" he said. \"And I am in that camp. I don't believe that homosexuality is a disorder or immoral.\"The overarching purpose of the new study is to delve deeper into the origins of sexuality. Bogaert says he is trying to understand sexual variability, human sexuality and sexual orientation as a piece of the larger puzzle.\"Unerstanding the biological mechanisms may have some social ramifications, and for me that's great if it ends up being positive,\" he added. \"But a larger motivation is just trying to understand sexuality, and understanding sexuality has its own benefits from a scientific perspective.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [471], "text": ["having more older brothers"]}, "id": "375715062893142016"}, {"question": "NYC subway worker helps rescue stroller that rolled onto tracks", "context": "A 2-year-old child and her mother are safe today thanks to the quick actions of some heroic strangers.On Monday morning a stroller with a toddler inside accidentally rolled onto the train tracks at the Jamaica Center-Parsons Boulevard and Archer Avenue stop in Queens, New York, CBS New York reported.

Our leader Carla Naumburg is showing us how we can make our family life calmer and happier through mindful parenting.I will never forget the first time I tried to meditate. I was sitting on a hard floor in a stinky gymnasium, hoping to score an easy PE credit so I could graduate from college. A tall, thin man dressed all in white with a long, wispy beard instructed us to cross our legs, close our eyes, breathe deeply and clear our minds.I was able to cross my legs, but it all went downhill from there.Clear my mind? What the hell did that mean? Every time I tried to clear my mind, I realized I was just thinking about clearing my mind, which clearly isn\u2019t the same thing. I tried thinking about black. I visualized black. But then I thought about how black isn\u2019t my favorite color; I prefer blue but I can\u2019t decide between sapphire or turquoise... and the next thing I knew, my mind was anything but clear. Also, my butt hurt from sitting on a hard floor, my nose itched, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I should scratch it.I didn\u2019t try meditation again for almost 20 years.Fast forward to parenthood. You know my story: I was yelling too much and I wanted to find a way to stay calm through the chaos of tantrums and whining and kids not listening. I did not want to meditate. But I was desperate, and everything I read about how to be kinder and less reactive pointed to meditation. Against my better judgment (at the time), I signed up for a mindfulness-based stress reduction course.Here is what I learned about meditation:1. You don\u2019t have to sit cross-legged on the floor to meditate. You can sit in a chair or on a meditation cushion or bench -- or you can lie down or walk. You can be comfortable.2. You don\u2019t have to close your eyes.3. You don\u2019t have to clear your mind. Far from it.4. Meditation isn\u2019t about staying perfectly focused on your breath or a candle or a mantra. It\u2019s about noticing when your mind has strayed and coming back, over and over again. Even seasoned meditators have a hard time staying focused.5. How you feel during your meditation session is not an indication of how successful or unsuccessful it was. How you feel after you meditate is much more important.I try to meditate for about 20 minutes at a time, several times a week. Please note, I said try. It doesn\u2019t happen every day for me, and it certainly doesn\u2019t have to happen every day for you. But meditation is dose dependent, meaning the more you do it, the more you will experience its benefits, such as decreased stress and reactivity (i.e. you\u2019ll be less likely to explode at your kids), improved sleep and better moods.So, if you\u2019re ready to give it a shot, here\u2019s what you need to do:Sit down and breathe.Here\u2019s how:Find a comfortable sitting position, either on a chair or on a cushion. If you\u2019re in a chair, sit with both feet on the floor. You can also lie down, and if you find yourself falling asleep, enjoy the nap. Next time, try keeping your eyes open.Take a few deep breaths to start, and then let your breathing steady out to however your body wants to breathe. You don\u2019t have to breathe slowly or deeply, just breathe normally. Pay attention to your breath, either at your nostrils or at your belly. You can say quietly \"in, out, in, out\" with each breath, or you can count your breaths, and when you get to 10, start again at one.When your mind wanders, as it will after about three seconds, just gently go back to your breathing. Try not to get frustrated with yourself; your mind is just doing what it is used to doing -- thinking! Just notice your thoughts, whatever they are, let them go, and go back to your breath. And then do it again, and again.If 20 minutes seems like a long time, try 10. Or two. Any amount of time is better than none. You can use a kitchen timer, a digital watch or any one of the apps listed below to help you.THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE 1.

While many situations are complex, there's one profoundly simple truth that men need to know: Women leave men they love.They feel terrible about it. It tears their heart out. But they do it. They rally their courage and their resources and they leave. Women leave men with whom they have children, homes and lives.Women leave for many reasons, but there's one reason in particular that haunts me, one that I want men to understand: Women leave because their man is not present.He's working, golfing, gaming, watching TV, fishing ... the list is long. These aren't bad men. They're good men. They're good fathers. They support their family. They're nice, likeable. But they take their wife for granted. They're not present.Women in my office tell me, \"Someone could come and sweep me off my feet, right out from under my husband.\" Sometimes the realization scares them. Sometimes it makes them cry.Men, I'm not saying this is right or wrong. I'm telling you what I see. You can get as angry, hurt or indignant as you want. Your wife is not your property. She does not owe you her soul. You earn it. Day by day, moment after moment.You win her over first and foremost with your presence, your aliveness. She needs to feel it. She wants to talk to you about what matters to her and to feel that you're listening to her. Not nodding politely. Not placating. Definitely not playing devil's advocate.She wants you to feel her. She doesn't want absent-minded groping or quick sex. She wants to feel your passion. Can you feel your passion? Can you show her? Not just your passion for her or for sex; your passion for being alive. Do you have it? It's the most attractive thing you possess. If you've lost it, what's the reason? Where did it go? Find out. Find it. If you never discovered it, you are living on borrowed time.If you think you're present with your wife, try listening to her. Does your mind wander? Notice. When you look at her, how deeply do you see her? Look again, look deeper.Meet her gaze and keep it for longer than usual, longer than what's comfortable. If she asks what you're doing, tell her, \"I'm looking into you. I want to see you deeply. I'm curious about who you are. After all these years I still want to know who you are, every day.\" But only say it if you mean it, if you know it's true.Touch her with your full attention. Before you put your hand on her, notice the sensation in your hand. Notice what happens the moment you make contact. What happens in your body? What do you feel? Notice the most subtle sensations and emotions. (This is sometimes described as mindfulness.) Tell her everything you're noticing, moment after moment.But you're busy. You don't have time for all this. How about five minutes? Five minutes a day. Will you commit to that? I'm not talking about extravagant dinners or date nights (although these are fine, too). I'm talking about five minutes a day to be completely present with the woman you share your life with.To be completely open -- listening and seeing without judgment. Will you do that? I bet once you start, once you get a taste, you won't want to stop.(Note: The gender dynamic outlined above is reversible.

Arkansas hiker Dawn Kelly decided to record the snakes on her smartphone instead, creating the kind of video most of us would rather watch from a safe distance.The unusual thing about this snake battle royale, however, isn't that Kelly managed to record it unscathed, but that the two snakes, a copperhead and a cottonmouth, shouldn't have been fighting at all.According to Alabama Auburn University herpetologist David Steen, male snakes often fight in something called a \"combat dance\" over female snakes. But until now, no one has recorded evidence of two different species of male snakes fighting, according to the BBC.When snakes wrestle, it's not to the death but to overpower the weaker snake and eventually mate with the female snake waiting for the winner nearby. But if the female snake is of a different species, this sort of a sparring match seems like a wasted effort since snakes can only mate with their own kind.The video shows the two male snakes battling, and there's no female snake or snakes captured in the footage. So it's ultimately unclear whether the male snakes were indeed fighting to impress female snakes off camera.Another herpetologist, Professor Phil Senter of Fayetteville State University in North Carolina, told the BBC the tangle could have been about territory and not a mating ritual at all. \"It could have just been a border dispute,\" Senter said.One thing both herpetologists can agree on: two different snake species fighting is extremely rare. \"I've never seen that before, two different species fighting each other as if they're the same species,\" Senter said.One possible explanation is that thanks to reptile breeders who have been known to artificially hybridize these two snake species into \"cottonheads\" or \"coppermouths,\" this might also happen without human intervention in the wild.It could also be a case of mistaken identity, especially since copperheads and cottonmouths are members of the same animal genus, Agkistrodon. \"Snakes are dumb,\" Senter said. \"Their brains are very, very small.

But, Warcraft has already managed to pull in more than $120 million internationally, according to Box Office Mojo, even amid incredibly low expectations for the movie's domestic release on Friday.Warcraft made a respectable $75 million in its first few weeks of a limited international release before opening in China on Wednesday (with midnight screenings starting Tuesday night) to record-setting box-office sales in the country that is expected to surpass the U.S. as the world's largest movie market sometime next year. The movie surged to a $46 million Chinese opening on Wednesday, setting a first-day box office record for a non-weekend release in the country while also breaking a record set last year by Furious 7 for its opening day sales in IMAX theaters, with $5.3 million, Deadline reports .Those blockbuster numbers come despite the fact that critics have lambasted the movie, with various reviews describing it as anywhere from \"rather tacky\" to \"unwatchable\" , to the tune of just a 23% rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes .Variety notes that Warcraft 's stellar start in China could pave the way for the movie to make as much as $150 million in that country, where the game the movie is based on\u2014Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft \u2014is especially popular , boasting a large chunk of the game's millions of fans.

The strong scent will help to deter them from the area and help them learn not to use the bathroom inside!Prevent cracked heelsDo you wish you had soft heals but are stick with skin that dries and cracks? Just grab some Vicks and apply it to your heels and feet. Wear cotton socks on top and be sure to wash your feet with warm water. Use the Vicks nightly and you can also rub a pumice stone onto your heels to help exfoliate and further soften your skin.Relieve headaches and migrainesIf you ever have headaches or migraines often, Vicks can be a great way to help provide some relief to the pain. The menthol in Vicks VapoRub helps to cool off your temples and relieve pressure if you rub some onto it.

If you're an entrepreneur or small business owner, it's hard not to, but all that extra time in the workplace isn't necessarily a good thing. After a certain point, it can be counterproductive and even hazardous to your health, so it's imperative to know when to say no to more hours.What the research says.Various organizations and independent researchers have looked at the physical, mental, emotional, and social effects of working beyond the standard 40 hours a week. Notable findings include the following:Working more than 10 hours a day is associated with a 60 percent jump in risk of cardiovascular issues.10 percent of those working 50 to 60 hours report relationship problems; the rate increases to 30 percent for those working more than 60 hours.Working more than 40 hours a week is associated with increased alcohol and tobacco consumption, as well as unhealthy weight gain in men and depression in women.Little productive work occurs after 50 hours per week.In companies with normal overtime, only 23 percent had absentee rates above 9 percent. In companies with high overtime, 54 percent had absentee rates above 9 percent.Individuals working 11 hours or more of overtime have an increased depression risk.Injury rates increase as work hours increase. Those who work 60 hours per week have a 23 percent higher injury hazard rate.In companies with an 8.7 percent overtime rate, researchers found no fatigue-related problems. When the overtime rate was 12.4 percent, however, fatigue-related problems were minor. By the time the overtime rate hit 15.4 percent, fatigue-related problems were severe.In manufacturing industries, a 10 percent increase in overtime yields a 2.4 percent decrease in productivity.In white collar jobs, productivity declines by as much as 25 percent when workers put in 60 hours or more.Many of the problems identified above tie to stress, which connect to hormonal balances. Specifically, stress raises cortisol, which can disrupt sleep, appetite, blood pressure, immune system function, memory/cognition, mood, and more.A general guideline for your wellbeing.The available research shows that most workers in the U.S. already are working close to the point where problems can start to occur.

The average American consumes two pounds of salmon a year, around two-thirds of which comes from farmed sources in China, Norway, and Canada. While wild-caught is largely self-explanatory, what exactly does farm raised mean in the context of fish, mainly salmon?Floating Pig FarmsAround 40 percent of all fish consumed annually, are raised on aquafarms which can either be land-based or ocean-based. Land-based farms raise thousands of fish in ponds, pools or even concrete tanks, where ocean-based aquafarms house fish in isolated cages either off-shore or in the open water.In both cases, fish are overstocked and have little space to swim or display their natural behaviors, creating an extremely stressful environment. Around 40 percent of aquafarmed fish will die before they are harvested. And with good reason. Stocking thousands of fish in a small amount of space and feeding them protein pellets (ironically made from other fish) doused with antibiotics and chemicals, such as PCB, understandably makes for highly polluted water.

The culprit could be your fascia (pronounced \"fash-ya\"), says Mary Ann Wilmarth, DPT, chief of physical therapy at Harvard University Health Services. This sheet of tissue, made up of densely packed protein fibers, weaves throughout the entire body, and it binds and supports your muscles, bones and even your organs. While bodywork specialists have been passionate about fascia for decades, Wilmarth says it took new research on how fascia and muscles work together (some of it presented at the first international fascia research conference at Harvard in 2007) to get different health pros -- from orthopedists to MDs and pain experts to personal trainers -- to catch on.How Fascia Makes You FeelYou have six times as many sensory neurons loaded in your fasciae as in any other tissue of your body except for your skin, explains Jill Miller, a fitness expert and longtime fascia evangelist (she's an experienced registered yoga teacher, has presented case studies at fascia research conferences and developed the Roll Model fascia therapy program). This internal webbing helps different muscle systems communicate with one another -- they're what make you want to get out of your office chair and stretch or roll your neck around. Ideally, your fascias should be supple enough to slide, glide, twist and bind like long, thin sheets of rubber. When they're not functioning properly, signals from the nerve endings are muffled or muted (so you don't feel comfortable in your own body) or they're interpreted by your brain as pain and discomfort.Find Your Inner FelineYou know how your muscles feel cramped and stiff when you wake up in the morning? After a night's sleep (or another long period of inactivity, like a car trip or plane ride), the parts of your fascia that wrap around and through your muscle fibers, which are normally stretchy and flexible, can stick together like previously chewed Hubba Bubba.The fix: The best way to release the fascia is to slowly and luxuriously stretch out your arms and legs and roll slowly from side to side before getting out of bed. This will gently pull the muscles apart and separate the connecting tissue, Wilmarth says. To get at the fascia in your calves, ankles and arches, sit on the edge of the bed and flex and point your feet before putting the pressure of your weight on them.Roll It Out Like Bread DoughFascia can be finicky: It gets stiff and sticky when you don't move around enough, but it can also get bound up and twisted when you move too much or do repetitive motion or injure yourself through activity, says James L. Thornton, the president of the National Athletic Trainers Association.The fix: Work out overused sore spots with a foam roller. You've probably seen people at the gym using these things, which look like pool noodles, to stretch their back, hamstrings and the notoriously tight IT band on the outside of the hips (this video from Jeff Richter, a certified strength and conditioning coach at St. Vincent Sports Performance in Indianapolis, provides a good foam-roller tutorial). Thornton says to go slowly, and when you get to a sore spot that feels like a bruise, pause for 15 to 20 seconds. The discomfort should melt away as the fascia softens and the muscles release. If you feel intense pain that doesn't dissipate, Thornton says to stop and consider making an appointment with a physical therapist. At home, you can give yourself a massage with tennis balls or Yoga Tune Up balls, which grip the skin to help loosen up individual layers of fascia. Also try a device called the Stick. It lets you really go deep into your calves, shins and hamstrings, but because it's more rigid than a foam roller, the Stick can feel much more intense (think deep-tissue massage versus regular rubdown).Stretch It OutYou've heard that before exercising, it's a good idea to do some dynamic stretching that includes swinging your legs and arms to improve your range of motion. This not only benefits your muscles, says Thornton, but it's also a great way to loosen up your fascia. When your muscles stay tight, the fascia clings to them, and both can become rigid over time.The fix: Take a brisk walk or jog lightly in place, and do some sports-specific moves (for example, leg swings for runners, or shoulder rolls for swimmers). Or try the lazy woman's warm-up: Start your workout, and stay at a slow, easy, I could-do-this-for-hours pace for about 5 minutes.Don't Let the Tissues Get \"Crunchy\"If you've ever had a shoulder rub and heard something that sounded like crinkling plastic under your skin, that wasn't your imagination -- it was probably your parched, stiffened fascia, says Ruth Werner, a past president of the Massage Therapy Foundation, who spent decades teaching anatomy and physiology to other therapists. The collagen fibers that make up fascia need to stay supple to work properly, and to slide over and under muscles and other inner-body surfaces.The fix: One way to keep the fascia hydrated is obvious: drink lots of fluids, says Werner. Another easy (but easily forgettable) way is to make sure you stand up, stretch and flex regularly throughout the day to keep the fascia from locking up. Werner says some research has also shown that rubbing tight areas -- as when you get a massage -- can boost circulation and warm the fascia, changing the texture to make it even more pliable.Let the Pros Handle ItBecause fascia is so interconnected, snags -- or adhesions, as pros call them -- in one area can affect other other areas. \"Imagine putting on multiple layers of long-sleeve shirts, and then think about how tugging on one of them would cause all of the other shirts to pull and stretch as well,\" says Cynthia Ribeiro, the president of the American Massage Therapy Association and a massage therapist. She stresses that you can't have healthy muscles without well-cared-for fascia.The fix: There are different therapeutic methods to address keeping the fascia healthy, from intense, sometimes-excruciating Rolfing to gentle fascial unwinding to myofascial release, which usually involves loading the deeper tissues with force until they start to give. If you're chronically stiff and sore, or you have a muscle injury that just won't heal, consult a specialist to see what would be right for you. Massage therapists like Ribeiro and PTs like Wilmarth have seen clients for whom nothing seemed to work...until a type of fascial therapy helped melt away their pain and stiffness.", "answers": {"answer_start": [376], "text": ["fascia"]}, "id": "540220559175716865"}, {"question": "Bad news for bacon lovers", "context": "Find out which grocery items have skyrocketed in price lately (plus, a surprising food that has dropped).Price Up: Bacon Experts began predicting that prices would zoom up last year after droughts affected feed crops, and then a new virus affecting pigs migrated to the U.S. this summer, further lowering supply of this high-demand meat. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average cost per pound of bacon has gone up 56 percent in 10 years (from $3.14 to $4.92) \u2014 compare that to beef steaks, which are up 41 percent in 10 years. In U.S. cities, the climb has been even steeper. Over the last 12 months alone, the average price of a pound of bacon in urban areas rose 22 percent to $5.62 per pound, up from $4.61 a year earlier. But if you use bacon as an accent instead of a main course, you\u2019ll get the salty, smoky flavor without spending as much. This stew recipe calls for just two slices.Price Up: Chocolate News that will give chocolate lovers pause: Not only is demand up for chocolate (thanks to seemingly endless reports of its health benefits) but supply is down, thanks to a shortage of cocoa beans in West Africa (the source for the majority of the world\u2019s beans). The result? Chocolate prices have soared to $12.25 per kilo (that\u2019s about 2 1/4 pounds) \u2014 up 45 percent from 2007, says The Wall Street Journal. Cocoa butter prices are rising, too (that\u2019s what gives chocolate its melt-in-your-mouth texture), which means it\u2019s costing manufacturers more to make their product. A slightly more expensive bar may still be worth it, though (here\u2019s a scientific reason why you should indulge, even \u2014 or especially \u2014 when you\u2019re stressed out).Price Up: Chicken Surveys show 94 percent of us eat chicken, and nearly four in 10 consumers say they increased their consumption of this healthy choice from 2011 to 2012. But the price of chicken \u2014 particularly boneless breasts \u2014 has risen more than many other groceries in the past six months, finds a recent survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation. That particular cut has risen 61 cents per pound, to $3.93. Bill Roenigk, chief economist for the National Chicken Council, says high corn (i.e., chicken feed) prices are partly to blame, as well as steady demand because of breast meat\u2019s low fat and calorie content. You\u2019ll spend less if you opt for leg meat, thoughRoenigk says dark meat tends to be cheaper than white, and isn\u2019t much different, calorie-wise: about 58 calories per ounce for dark, versus 47 for white (and some experts believe it\u2019s healthier for your heart).Price Up: Wild-Caught Fish Wild-caught fish could be on its way to becoming a special treat: The global fish-price index of the UN\u2019s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) hit a record high earlier this year, a result of increased demand and a surge in oil prices (which has a big impact on the cost of operating fishing boats and transporting the catch). Fish that is wild (not farmed) has seen the sharpest price hike, nearly doubling between 1990 and 2012, whereas the index for farmed fish rose by only a fifth (here\u2019s why). Some of the best eco- (and wallet-) friendly options are farm-raised striped bass or farm-raised rainbow trout, which sell for about $8 a pound and have relatively light impact on the environment. That\u2019s significantly lower than wild-caught fish that offer a similar taste and texture, such as cod (which ranges from $14 to $25 a pound) or halibut ($24 a pound).Price Down: Honeycrisp Apples The \"designer\" apple known as honeycrisp is sweet, juicy, snappy \u2014 and (historically, anyway) pricey, costing as much as $4.50 a pound while in-season Cortlands went for $1.50 a pound.

The lawsuit is a proposed class action, with Kubelskas and Brunner arguing that such pay practices come from \"corporate set policies\" and would apply to other workers.Jimmy John's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.According to Kubelskas and Brunner, Jimmy John's workers aren't given enough time to complete all their closing duties at the end of the day, at which point managers clock them out regardless of whether or not they continue to work. The practice is exacerbated, they claim, by a company policy that bases managers' bonuses largely on whether or not they hit their targets on labor costs.The system, they say, \"has the practical effect of creating widespread wage theft.\"Brunner, who's represented by the Chicago firm Foote, Mielke, Chavez & O\u2019Neil, originally filed suit against the company in July, but she filed an additional, joint complaint with Kubelskas last week. Both suits name JS Fort Group, which they describe as a franchisee, as a defendant alongside Jimmy John's Enterprises.Founded in Illinois in 1983, Jimmy John's has built its foundation on the \"irreverent attitude and dirt-cheap prices\" championed by its founder, Jimmy John Liautaud, according to the company's website. The sandwich chain now has more than 1,900 locations throughout the U.S., and it was often highlighted as an entrepreneurial success story by failed GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney on the 2012 campaign trail.Of Jimmy John's employees, the company's site says, \"They don't mind doing whatever it takes to get the job done. Their hustle is part of how they live their daily lives, and they enjoy the fruits of a hard-earned entrepreneurial lifestyle.\"The proposed class action isn't the first time Jimmy John's has been the target of a lawsuit from workers. Last November, 300 delivery drivers sued a major Jimmy John's franchise operator, claiming that the auto expenses they were forced to bear pushed their earnings below the minimum wage.In 2011, a group of 10 Jimmy John's locations became the target of a heated labor organizing campaign by the Industrial Workers of the World, who'd launched a then-rare bid to unionize fast food workers. The union narrowly lost the election, and six workers later claimed they were fired due to their union support.

Here's what science tells us...", "context": "Are we living in a holographic simulation created by a supercomputer beyond our comprehension? That question occurs again and again in science fiction, perhaps most notably in The Matrix, a film in which unreality is so pristine that no one notices the truth. That we are all actually, truly living in such a matrix seems laughable until you consider the advances made by video games in the last few decades.Not long ago, all we had was pong: two rectangles and a circle. Today we have virtual reality consoles which are edging toward an experience indistinguishable from reality, or at least what we think of as reality. Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX cofounder, was recently asked this question: Is it possible that the world as we know it is just a simulation made by someone else?His response is perhaps startling, saying that the chances of this reality being a \"base\" reality are \"one in billions.\" To make matters even more confusing, humans are increasingly turning to virtual reality devices to escape this \"reality.\" Thorsten Wiedemann, for example, spent forty-eight hours wearing his Oculus Rift device, proving it is possible to live within a virtual reality at least for a short time.When we asked Bill Nye the Science Guy if he thinks we are living in a computer-generated simulation, he turned to some basic scientific principles to justify his answer. Science ultimately demands testable, repeatable hypotheses to proceed, but how do you test whether we are living in a computer simulation or not? There just doesn't seem to be a way.There is every possibility that this is a hyper-real version of The Sims, and we wouldn\u2019t know. If we had never seen the outside world, there\u2019s no reason we would know it exists, that we\u2019re missing it. So if we as a people had only ever existed in this hyper real video game, we wouldn\u2019t know it was all just a game.That is why it is \"unknowable,\" according to Bill Nye. If we were in a video game, human minds would not be able to detect the outside world until \"something goes wrong,\" i.e. a glitch in the matrix.

It gets blamed for infidelity and divorce. Oh the Terrible Societal Pressure of Monogamy! the naysayers tut tut. It's so very difficult, they sigh, as if monogamy was some high-maintence diva demanding the right sort of mineral water. It's just impossible to meet the ridiculous expectations of monogamy!Poor monogamy. Some find it freakish. \"We did not evolve to be monogamous,\" the critics cry, pointing to hedonistic bonobos and walruses, the Hugh Heffners of the animal kingdom. Don't you want to be one of the fun animals? Who's left with monogamy? Wolves and swans, that's who -- pretty creatures known for their savagery and aggression.Monogamy, I'm sorry you've gotten a bad name. For what it's worth, I think you're cool. Hurrah for the faithful! Three cheers for the same ol' same ol'!I know it's easy to dismiss me, a happily married, squidgy, middle-aged woman. Oh god, you would like monogamy. You probably have dial up. What other dorktacular, old school things do you enjoy? LP records and butter churning?Maybe you think my husband is pussy-whipped because he's faithful. If you do, please tell him that to his face -- he's a pick-up truck driving, \"law and order liberal,\" Texas trial lawyer who owns a gun. I had one of the other kinds of husbands once, the unfaithful kind, and I much prefer this one, thank you.Clearly, I lack the sophistication and edginess to be polyamorous. If you're polyamorous, I wish you all the best. Please enjoy your swingers parties in your shag-carpeted, sunken living rooms. Negotiate your open marriages, use protection, and rock on with your bad selves.I just have one request -- quit beating up on monogamy. Monogamy is not the problem. Let me introduce the real villain, the culprit behind infidelity and divorce -- entitlement. Yes, entitlement, otherwise known as narcissism, selfishness, or \"I need a few months living alone in Spain to find myself.\"Entitlement has unfairly framed monogamy for infidelity for quite some time and I'd like to set the record straight.1. Cheating is about the thrill of being dishonest. To \"cheat\" you need an agreement to renege on, namely monogamy. There's no frisson of danger in openness, no illicit sexual high to chase. A recent study \"The Cheater's High: The Unexpected Affective Benefits of Unethical Behavior\" by researchers at the University of Washington, the London Business School, Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania show that cheaters feel happier after cheating. Why? They feel superior, more clever than the people they just chumped. Screwing around feels awesome, so long as you're short on empathy. You know who's empathy challenged? Narcissists.There is a power dynamic inherent in infidelity. The cheater wants all the perks of a committed partner, and the excitement of messing around on the side. The secrecy is about gaining advantage. You commit all your resources and I'll just feign reciprocity. Cheaters don't want a level playing field. It's about control and entitlement. Cheaters give themselves permission to cheat, because they deem themselves more deserving than the chumpy people who play by the rules. (Rules the cheater agreed to, of course.)2. If polyamory is \"natural,\" so is heartbreak. If we've \"evolved\" to screw around, well, we're also wired to be jealous and suffer heartache when we are abandoned. Where's all the talk of how unnatural it is to bond with other people? Gee, we should really stop doing that. This whole trust thing is really overrated.Murderous impulses are also human, and felt very keenly after one's been betrayed. When the cuckolded husband clubs his wife's lover with a baseball bat, they can each claim they \"evolved\" to be this way -- one to screw around indiscriminately, the other to react in a murderous rage. Let's see how those arguments go over in the court of law.We didn't evolve to do a lot of things -- farm, use indoor plumbing, wear lederhosen. Your Darwinian urges are no excuse for behaving unethically. Can we put this tired argument to rest already?3. Monogamy is not difficult -- honest conversations are. You're not good at monogamy? Stay single or find a polyamorous arrangement. Things not working out in the marriage? Speak up and make it work or get out honestly. Unless yours was a shotgun wedding, no one forces you to commit. Lost in the \"monogamy is so hard\" argument is personal choice. Don't agree to be someone you aren't.Oh boo hoo, the pressure. Your parents want grandchildren and your girlfriend is obsessed with Say Yes to the Dress. Find your backbone, son. Don't be a farce registered at Macy's.And if you agreed to this monogamy thing and changed your mind? You're not doing anyone any favors by unilaterally deciding to betray them.

Almost exactly an hour-long speech, though we will try to get an exact count.10:10 p.m. ECHOES OF 2008 \u2014 The president borrows a rhetorical tool he used in his 2008 nominating acceptance speech \u2014 finding middle ground on contentious issues.2008: \"We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.\"2014: \"We still may not agree on a woman\u2019s right to choose, but surely we can agree it\u2019s a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows.\"10:09 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 8 \u2014What he said: \"I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states, that we are the United States of America.\"What he meant: \"I\u2019m almost done here.\"Obama spent most of the speech trying to prove he\u2019s not a lame duck \u2014 and, in fact, sounded energized and eager for battle against Republicans in his final two years. But the reappearance of the \"red states and blue states\" line from his 2004 Democratic convention speech \u2014 the line that may have aged the least well from the speech that launched his national political career \u2014 showed that he\u2019s not above a little nostalgia, and a return to the optimism of the old days, as he prepares to wrap up his presidency.10:08 p.m. OBAMA AD-LIBS AGAIN \u2014 After Republicans derisively cheer when Obama says he doesn\u2019t have any more elections to run, Obama ad-libs: \"I know because I won both of them.\"10:00 p.m. OBAMA\u2019S LEGACY MOMENT \u2014 In a somewhat amazing moment of self-awareness about his legacy and political career, the president invokes his famous 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address in acknowledging his difficulty \u2014 as well as his continuing hope \u2014 to unite the country. \"How ironic, [pundits] say, that our politics seems more divided than ever. It\u2019s held up as proof not just of my own flaws \u2014 of which there are many \u2014 but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, and nai\u0308ve ... But I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long.\"9:54 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 7 \u2014What he said: \"One year doesn\u2019t make a trend, but this does \u2013 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.\"What he meant: \"I\u2019m looking at you, James Inhofe.\"The new chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, a vocal skeptic of climate change, has vowed to block the Obama administration\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions rule and other new environmental regulations. Obama is signaling that he\u2019ll fight back \u2014 if nothing else, to convince Democrats that he\u2019s still on the case and hasn\u2019t given up on climate change.9:51 p.m. THREE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES ABSENT \u2014 Just two-thirds of the Supreme Court is present at the State of the Union address, Time reports. Conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Antonin Scalia are not in the House chamber for the president\u2019s speech. Scalia hasn\u2019t gone for more than a decade, while Thomas has decried the event as \"so partisan.\" In 2010, after Obama criticized the court\u2019s Citizens United decision, cameras caught Alito mouthing \"not true.\"9:48 p.m. OBAMA ON CUBA \u2014 \"When what you\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t work for fifty years, it\u2019s time to try something new. ... And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo.\"9:46 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 6: OBAMA CALLS FOR AUMF AGAINST ISIL \u2014What he said: \"Tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.\"What he meant: \"Step up, McCain.\"Obama is taking plenty of heat from Republican critics like John McCain, his former 2008 rival, and Lindsey Graham for not taking tough enough actions to stop the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant terrorist group. He\u2019s also faced skepticism from other lawmakers, including Democrats, who say they can\u2019t get consistent answers on what the administration\u2019s goals are. So by asking Congress to give him formal authorization for military action, he\u2019s basically trying to force his critics to share ownership of the issue and spell out what kinds of military actions they\u2019re willing to support \u2014 including whether they would back the possible use of ground troops.9:44 p.m. PARIS ATTACK TALK: Lawmakers, including Rep. Gwen Moore of Oklahoma, hold up yellow pencils when Obama brings up the attack in Paris.9:42 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 5 \u2014What he said: \"Look, I\u2019m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven\u2019t always lived up to the hype.\"What he meant: \"I hear you, Rosa DeLauro.\"The speech made clear that Obama will try to get Congress to approve fast-track trade authority \u2014 one of the few areas where he and congressional Republicans actually share the same interests. But he has to nod to the concerns of liberal Democrats \u2014 including DeLauro, a House Democrat from Connecticut who opposes the trade deals the administration is brokering \u2014 that the agreements won\u2019t include enough environmental and labor protections. The bottom line, Obama said, is that \"95 percent of the world\u2019s customers live outside our borders, and we can\u2019t close ourselves off from those opportunities.\"9:39 p.m. THE ISSUE OBAMA AND CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS AGREE ON \u2014First time Rs give Obama a standing ovation and Dems don't - 33 minutes into speech, calling for Trade Promotion Authority \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) January 21, 20159:37 p.m. OBAMA ON KEYSTONE \u2014 \"So let\u2019s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.\"David Nather, on what he meant: \"You\u2019re not getting Keystone.\"Obama has already threatened to veto legislation approving the Keystone XL pipeline, infuriating Republicans who have put its approval at the top of their energy agenda. Rather than touch off that fight again, Obama opted for the \"let\u2019s set our sights higher\" construction \u2014 but there\u2019s no mystery about the signal he\u2019s trying to send.9:34 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 4 \u2014What he said: \"Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible.\"What he meant: \"Seriously, Tennessee is a red state and they\u2019re doing this.\"Obama wants to make the most out of the fact that his community college proposal \u2014 which would make the first two years tuition-free for many students \u2014 is modeled on a program launched by Republican Gov. Bill Haslam. But other Republicans, including Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, say they don\u2019t want to expand it into a federal program; they\u2019d rather let the states make their own choices.9:33 p.m. RBG ASLEEP \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Manu Raju reports that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, seated in the House chamber, is asleep.9:29 p.m. BIG DEM APPLAUSE LINE: MINIMUM WAGE \u2014A big play to the Democratic base with this appeal on the minimum wage. \"And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it,\" he said, to a standing ovation and hoots from Democrats. \"If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.\"9:28 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 3 \u2014What he said: \"So I\u2019ll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let\u2019s put it to a vote right here in Washington.\"What he meant: \"Maybe the states will listen to me.\"White House advisers know there\u2019s not a big chance that a Republican Congress will pass his agenda, but they believe there will be chances to prod states into action \u2014 and paid leave is one of the issues where they think they can shape the debate. And if congressional Republicans vote against issues like paid leave, the advisers believe, they\u2019re just hurting themselves. \u2014 David Nather9:23 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 2 \u2014What he said: \"So the verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don\u2019t get in the way.\"What he meant: \"Did I mention I\u2019m at 50 percent?\"Obama is basking in the best run of economic news he\u2019s had in a long time, all of which have boosted his approval rating to the highest level since spring 2013, according to the latest ABC News-Washington Post poll. His message to Republicans: Don\u2019t assume the public hates my economic ideas \u2013 including my latest package of tax hikes on the wealthy \u2014 as much as you do.9:22 p.m. OBAMA AD LIB \u2014 Twelve minutes in, and this reporter thinks Obama appears to be in a confident mood. It\u2019s all over his face. After a laundry list of ways that the U.S. has improved under his watch \u2014 job creation, lowered fuel costs, better education results \u2014 Obama moves away from his prepared remarks for a moment. \"This is good news, people!\" he says to laughter, offering a wink and a smile.9:16 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 1, courtesy of the great David Nather \u2014What he said: \"Tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.\"What he meant: \"Tonight, I want to talk about 2016.\"Obama has already promised Democrats he\u2019s going to \"play offense\" against Republicans over the next two years, vetoing legislation and fighting against efforts to dismantle his agenda. It\u2019s all part of an effort Democratic political strategists believe will be necessary heading into the 2016 elections: frame the big policy choices against the GOP \u2014 and set up the fights that will carry into Hillary Clinton\u2019s likely campaign for the White House.9:14 p.m. \u2018THE STATE OF THE UNION IS STRONG\u2019 \u2014 \"The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong,\" the president says. \"At this moment \u2014 with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production \u2014 we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.\"9:11 p.m. OBAMA HAILS \u2018BREAKTHROUGH YEAR FOR AMERICA\u2019 \u2014 \"Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999,\" the president says, to big applause in the chamber.9:10 p.m. POTUS TAKES THE PODIUM \u2014 After shaking hands with Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker John Boehner, the Republican leader introduces the president. Obama begins his speech and we are officially underway.9:06 p.m. POTUS ENTERS THE CHAMBER \u2014 President Barack Obama entered the chamber wearing a dark suit and gray tie. Walking behind him are congressional leaders House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.Handshake and pat on the arm for Secretary of State John Kerry and a big hug for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.9:04 p.m. POTUS not yet in the chamber.9:01 p.m. IDLE CHATTER \u2014 As lawmakers wait for the president, video catches conversations between:\u2014 Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel\u2014 Democratic Reps. Eleanor Holmes Norton of Washington, D.C. and Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri\u2014 Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Al Franken of Minnesota (sharing a laugh)8:56 p.m. MINIMAL MIXED SEATING \u2014 Some Democrats and Republicans are seated next to each other, but not many, POLITICO\u2019s Manu Raju reports. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) is sitting next to Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is seated in between Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.), and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) is in between Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.)8:50 p.m. #SOTU UP TO 452 TWEETS PER MINUTE \u2014 Wow.8:45 p.m. ERNST\u2019S CAMO SHOES \u2014 POLITICO congressional reporter Seung Min Kim plays fashion reporter for a night and gets a shot of the camouflage shoes of Iowa Sen.

POLITICO\u2019s Burgess Everett reported earlier this afternoon that the Nevada Democrat was unlikely to attend the speech. Reid returned to his Senate office today for the first time following injuries he sustained while exercising earlier this month, including fractured ribs and bones in his face.8:35 p.m. SITTING COURTSIDE \u2014 Members of Congress often vie for the aisle seats in the House chamber, within speaking and handshake distance when the president enters. According to POLITICO\u2019s Jake Sherman, here\u2019s a partial list of lawmakers who snagged a prized aisle seat: Reps. Billy Long of Missouri, Rep. Barbara Lee of California, Mark Takano of California, Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas and, of course, Eliot Engel of New York.8:30 p.m. KING CLARIFIES \u2018DEPORTABLE\u2019 COMMENT \u2014 Rep. Steve King tried to make a joke out of the comment he made about a guest invited to the State of the Union by President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama.\"The futility of language emerges on Twitter,\" the Iowa Republican said. He then tried to channel pop star Taylor Swift, telling reporters to \"Shake it off.\"When pressed further, King blamed Obama and said the controversy would have no impact on the Iowa Freedom Summit, his 2016 presidential hopeful gathering in Des Moines this weekend.\"Why isn\u2019t the president taking heat for what he\u2019s doing to the rule of law?\" asked an unrepentant King. \"He\u2019s going to make another promise that he\u2019s going to violate the Constitution tonight. At least one.\"King, perhaps Congress\u2019 fiercest and most outspoken critic on immigration, harshly criticized the president and first lady on Twitter for inviting a DREAM-er to sit in the first lady\u2019s box. \u2014 John Bresnahan8:25 p.m. PHOTO: MARTHA RADDATZ AND PAUL RYAN \u2014 The ABC News correspondent and Wisconsin Republican share a photo years after Raddatz\u2019s moderation of 2012 vice-presidential debate between Ryan and Joe Biden.And great to see Rep.

Foxx, normally 13th in line for the presidency, would assume the nation\u2019s highest office and provide continuity of government if such a tragedy struck.Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz was last year\u2019s designated survivor. \u2014 Kevin Robillard7:50 p.m. #SOTU: MORE THAN A TWEET PER SECOND \u2014 A couple hours before the speech, there were about 80-130 tweets per minute using the official #SOTU hashtag, according to POLITICO\u2019s Andrea Bitely.7:40 p.m. 2016 GOVERNORS WEIGH IN \u2014 Capitol Hill and President Barack Obama are in the spotlight tonight, but at least two GOP presidential hopefuls don\u2019t want to be left out.Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker \u2014 two governors weighing running for the Republican nomination in 2016 \u2014 took to Twitter to criticize Obama ahead of his speech.\"I\u2019ll save you 45 mins. Obama will decry Republicans, beat up on private business and argue for more \u2018free stuff\u2019. Your welcome,\" Jindal wrote. (While his timing estimate is pretty close to our reported 50-minute estimate, he might have been better served by going with \"You\u2019re.\")Walker also took a shot at the president on Twitter. \"President seems to measure success by how many people are dependent on the govt,\" he wrote. \"We should measure success by just the opposite.\"7:35 p.m. PHOTO: ALAN AND JUDY GROSS \u2014 Alan Gross, the USAID subcontractor who was reunited with his family last month after being imprisoned in Cuba for five years, appears in a pre-SOTU photo with his wife Judy.Alan and Judy Gross are ready for the #SOTU.

Making government bigger isn\u2019t going to help the middle class. More growth and more opportunity will help the middle class, and those are the Republican priorities.\"7:20 p.m. POLL: 42 PERCENT SAY STATE OF THE NATION IS STRONG \u2014 Forty-two percent of Americans believe the U.S. is in good or excellent shape, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released hours before tonight\u2019s speech. That\u2019s compared with 57 percent who say the state of the nation is not so good or poor.Still, the survey offered some good news for the president as he nears his address to the nation. A plurality of Americans \u2014 42 percent \u2014 believe his policies have helped the economy, while 27 percent said they slowed economic development. And a quarter of Americans say their financial situation has improved since Obama took office, the best number of his presidency.7:10 p.m. ERNST EXCERPTS RELEASED \u2014 Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) will declare that the new Republican majority in Congress is \"back to work\" for Americans, stressing that the era of \"political talking points\" is over in the official GOP response to President Barack Obama\u2019s State of the Union.In excerpts released in advance of Obama\u2019s speech, Ernst will ask to have a \"conversation\" with viewers, pledging that lawmakers in Washington are \"ready to make Washington focus on your concerns again.\"\"We heard the message you sent in November \u2014 loud and clear,\" Ernst will say, a reference to the decisive GOP victories last fall. \"And now we\u2019re getting to work to change the direction Washington has been taking our country.\"The message Ernst plans to send on behalf of the Republican Party is a clear attempt to showcase a GOP that is ready to shift the focus away from a gridlocked Washington that Ernst said held the \"same stale mindset\" that led to policies such as Obama\u2019s health care law.Ernst will strike a tone of cooperation between the Obama White House and Republicans who dominate the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, citing trade and tax reform as two potential areas for a bipartisan compromise.To see the full excerpts released for Ernst\u2019s speech, go here. \u2014 Seung Min Kim7:00 p.m. KING RAILS AGAINST FLOTUS SOTU GUEST \u2014 Rep. Steve King, perhaps Congress\u2019s fiercest and most outspoken critic on immigration, harshly criticized the president and first lady for inviting a DREAM-er to sit in the first lady\u2019s box.\"Obama perverts \u2018prosecutorial discretion\u2019 by inviting a deportable to sit in place of honor at #SOTU w/1st Lady. I should sit with Alito,\" the Iowa Republican wrote on Twitter, in reference to Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, part of the court\u2019s conservative wing.Ana Zamora will sit with first lady Michelle Obama in her box this evening. She moved from Mexico when she was a year old, and has expressed gratitude to the president for his 2012 executive order that has allowed her to stay in the U.S.6:50 p.m. 42 LAWMAKERS TO PAY TRIBUTE TO CHARLIE HEBDO \u2014 Forty-two Democratic lawmakers will pay tribute to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre during tonight\u2019s speech, a spokesman for Rep. Gwen Moore told POLITICO.Moore, a Wisconsin Democrat, planned to lead a group of lawmakers in holding up a yellow pencil during applause breaks when the president mentions the terrorist attacks on the French satirical newspaper. The yellow pencil has become an international symbol for freedom of expression and the press following the attacks.According to Moore spokesman Eric Harris, the lawmakers are: Gwen Moore, Keith Ellison, Barbara Lee, Marcia Fudge, Karen Bass, Charlie Rangel, Janice Hahn, John Conyers, Jim McGovern, Mark Pocan, Joe Courtney, Ruben Gallego, Bobby Rush, Matt Cartwright, Steve Cohen, Bill Foster, Mark Takano, Raul Grijalva, Jackie Speier, Gene Green, Mark DeSaulnier, Rosa DeLauro, Nita Lowey, Doris Matsui, Derek Kilmer, Sander Levin, Eliot Engel, David Cicilline, Loretta Sanchez, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Alan Grayson, Grace Napolitano, Juan Vargas, Donald Payne Jr., Kyrsten Sinema, Alan Lowenthal, Dina Titus, Joaquin Castro, Jim Langevin, Marc Veasey, Chris Van Hollen, John Garamendi, Sam Farr, Debbie Dingell, Michelle Lujan Grisham, Suzan DelBene.Harris added that the list is \"growing by the minute.\"6:30 p.m. SPEECH EXCERPTS RELEASED \u2014 President Barack Obama will use his State of the Union address Tuesday to convey his continued dedication to \"middle-class economics\" and to call for \"a smarter kind of American leadership abroad,\" according to excerpts of his speech provided by the White House.\"The verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don\u2019t get in the way,\" Obama will say. He also will discuss his desire for smart foreign policy around the world and call on Congress to pass a resolution authorizing military action against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.For a link to the full excerpts released by the White House, go here. \u2014 Jennifer Epstein6:20 p.m. CAPITOL POLICE: OBAMA WILL BE DONE BY 9:50 PM \u2014U.S. Capitol Police are telling officers that they anticipate President Barack Obama will finish his State of the Union address by 9:50 p.m., POLITICO\u2019s John Bresnahan reports. A 50-minute speech would be the president\u2019s shortest-ever State of the Union address: As we noted earlier, Mark Knoller of CBS News reported that Obama\u2019s shortest speech to a joint session of Congress lasted one hour.6:15 p.m. WHAT DOES SOTU MEAN FOR CONGRESS? In a new video, POLITICO senior congressional reporter Manu Raju previews tonight\u2019s speech and what it means for lawmakers on the Hill.5:45 p.m. SCOTT: OBAMA EMBRACING \u2018FAILED\u2019 POLICIES \u2014 Add Florida Gov. Rick Scott to the list of Republicans slamming President Barack Obama even before his State of the Union address gets underway.The Republican governor \u2014 who narrowly won reelection against Democrat Charlie Crist in one of the nastiest races in the 2014 cycle \u2014 took aim at Obama\u2019s proposal that seeks to lower taxes for the middle class while raising the top capital gains rate and closing loopholes for wealthy individuals.\"The massive tax increases proposed by the President reflect his commitment to the failed, liberal policies that were roundly rebuked by the American people in November,\" Scott said in a statement released in advance of tonight\u2019s speech.In recent days and weeks, the White House has changed its tactics by aggressively marketing their policy proposals ahead of the State of the Union, both to generate buzz and gather momentum. Scott\u2019s statement is yet another indication, though, that the policy rollout is also allowing Republicans to go on the attack early, as well.5:15 p.m. A stunning photo from POLITICO photographer M. Scott Mahaskey of National Statuary Hall beginning to come alive. The hall just outside the House chamber is a major hub for television camera crews every year before the State of the Union address.Statuary Hall takes shape as a multi-crew television studio as crews setup for the #SOTU Jan. 20, 2015 at the US Capitol in Washington, DC. (M. Scott Mahaskey/Politico) ? A photo posted by POLITICO (@politico) on Jan 20, 2015 at 2:00pm PST5:00 p.m. DON\u2019T YOU HAVE WORK TO DO? \u2014 Several members of Congress have already shown up to reserve seats in the Chamber hours ahead of President Barack Obama\u2019s speech \u2014 despite an explicit message from House Speaker John Boehner not to do so.\"As has been the practice in the past, members will not be allowed to reserve seats prior to the joint session by placement of placards or personal items,\" the speaker\u2019s office wrote in an email earlier today. \"Chamber Security may remove these items from the seats.\"But some lawmakers \u2014 most notably perennial early-arriver Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), who arrived at 8:30 a.m., according to CNN \u2014 have already arrived to reserve seats along the aisle to get a fist-bump or quick chat from the president as he enters the chamber.Other lawmakers who have reserved seats, include Reps. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, Marcia Fudge of Ohio, Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Steve Cohen of Tennessee, according to CNN.4:25 p.m. TEA PARTY LEADER: \u2018TWO TEA PARTY RESPONSES\u2019 TONIGHT: The head of the Tea Party Express, the group responsible for the tea party response to the State of the Union, says the conservative movement will have two responses tonight \u2014 Curt Clawson ... and Joni Ernst.\"Sen. Ernst earned the support of Tea Party Express in the primary and was able to coalesce tea party members and activists across the state of Iowa because of her message and her values that are representative of the larger tea party movement. ... So, in that vein, I would say there\u2019s going to be two tea party responses,\" Tea Party Express Executive Director Taylor Budowich said in a phone interview with POLITICO.Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, of course, will be delivering the official Republican response tonight, while Florida Rep. Curt Clawson of Florida will deliver the tea party one. But Tea Party Express endorsed Ernst when she ran to the right of the field in the 2014 Republican primary, and the new senator has significant support from grassroots conservatives.Budowich dismissed concerns about whether the annual tradition was deepening rifts between the conservative and establishment wings of the GOP, predicting that Clawson and Ernst\u2019s speeches would be \"complementary.\" He argued that a tea party response is still helpful in 2015, even though he estimated that there is 95 percent overlap between the official Republican Party platform and that of the tea party.Tea Party Express has hosted an official tea party response to the State of the Union since 2011.When asked how many more years his organization would feel compelled to offer its own, separate response to the State of the Union, Budowich they plan to stop in 2017 \u2014 because the president will be a member of the tea party, naturally.4:05 p.m. BIDEN TO CALIFORNIA \u2014 Vice President Joe Biden will visit southern California later this week, the White House announced today. On Friday, Biden will address West Los Angeles College to discuss higher education. Earlier this month, the White House unveiled a plan to make two years of community college free for all students, a proposal the president will likely discuss this evening.The vice president will also speak at the Patient Safety, Science & Technology Summit in Irvine on Saturday. Other speakers at the summit include former President Bill Clinton, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Reps.

Now, because of President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration in November 2014, Blanca\u2019s mom is able to apply for Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA).\"Gamez is currently applying for law school and working for a local nonprofit called ProgressNow Nevada. \u2014 James Hohmann3:50 p.m. PORTMAN FUNDRAISING OFF SOTU FOR SENATE RUN \u2014 Sen. Rob Portman is soliciting donations for his upcoming Senate run by criticizing the president ahead of tonight\u2019s address. The Ohio Republican \u2014 who last month announced he would not run for president and would instead seek reelection to the Senate \u2014 sent a fundraising email to supporters this afternoon.\"In past State of the Union addresses, the President has repeatedly touted ineffective policies and made promises to the American people that he could not keep,\" Portman writes in the email. \"I don\u2019t know about you, but I am fed up with the failures of the Obama administration and think it\u2019s time we take a stand.\" The email then links to a donation page for his 2016 campaign.The NRCC also sent a fundraising note to supporters earlier in the day based on Obama\u2019s State of the Union address.Portman, who was first elected to the Senate in 2010, co-chaired the NRSC in 2014.3:45 p.m. LAWMAKERS TO OFFER CHARLIE HEBDO TRIBUTE \u2014 Rep. Gwen Moore will lead a group of lawmakers in a tribute to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris, her office said today. A spokesman for the Wisconsin Democrat said that the congresswoman \u2014 along with other lawmakers \u2014 will hold up a yellow pencil during applause breaks when the president mentions the terrorist attacks on the French satirical newspaper. The yellow pencil has become an international symbol for freedom of expression and the press following the attacks.\"The congresswoman believes that this is unique opportunity to join our global partners in showing our collective support and solidarity,\" Moore press secretary Eric Harris said in a statement.Harris noted that Moore, who suffered two broken feet and a broken arm after she fell over the holidays, will be in a wheelchair for the speech.3:00 p.m. NRCC FUNDRAISING OFF SOTU \u2014 The National Republican Congressional Committee is setting a fundraising target for tonight at 9 p.m., the time of the president\u2019s State of the Union address. The NRCC sent out an email this afternoon from Republican strategist and former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove slamming Obama for executive overreach.\"President Obama will double down on his go-it-alone strategy in tonight\u2019s State of the Union address,\" Rove\u2019s email says.The NRCC is hoping to reach its target of 1,000 membership renewals by the time Obama addresses the joint session of Congress tonight.2:45 p.m. WARREN BACKS OBAMA TAX PLAN \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren today offered her support for the White House middle-class tax plan that the president will detail in his speech.The Massachusetts senator, a favorite in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, offered praise on Twitter for the plan that would raise taxes on the wealthy by raising the top capital gains rate and closing certain loopholes. \"The game is rigged when people pay higher taxes working for money than inheriting it,\" she wrote. \"I support @barackobama\u2019s plan.\"Obama\u2019s proposal will face long odds in the Republican-dominated House and Senate. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin have already signaled their objection to the proposal.Warren\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.1:20 p.m. RAND WOULD LIKE A WORD \u2014 Sen.

In a not-so-subtle bit of symbolism, both the president and some congressional Republicans are bringing guests to highlight their views on the issue.Alan Gross, the USAID subcontractor who was imprisoned for five years in Cuba, will join First lady Michelle Obama in her box tonight, along with his wife, Judy. The White House secured Gross\u2019s release as part of the agreement to normalize relations with Cuba. Republicans who objected to Obama\u2019s Cuba deal last month cheered Gross\u2019s return to the U.S.House Speaker John Boehner will host dissident and activist Jorge Luis Garci\u0301a Pe\u0301rez, who served 17 years as a political prisoner under the Castro regime. Pe\u0301rez, known as Antu\u0301nez, has spoken out against Obama for the deal, which he has said appeases the repressive actions of the Cuban regime. In The Wall Street Journal, a Boehner spokesman said the Ohio Republican\u2019s guests highlight \"victims of the continuing tyranny on Cuba.\"Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American, will host Rosa Maria Paya Acevedo, an activist whose dissident father died in a 2012 car accident that the family believes was orchestrated by the Cuban regime. \"While I disagree with the president\u2019s new Cuba policy, I hope Rosa Mari\u0301a Paya\u0301\u2019s presence on Tuesday night will at least remind him that her father\u2019s murderers have not been brought to justice, and that the U.S. is now, in fact, sitting at the table with them,\" Rubio said in a statement.Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Cuba, will host Marlene Alejandre Triana, whose father died when his plane was shot down by the Cuban Air Force in 1996. Ros-Lehtinen is holding a joint press conference with fellow Florida Republican Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Carlos Curbelo, as well as Antu\u0301nez and his wife, at 4:30 p.m. today to discuss the White House Cuba policy.12:15 p.m. REID BACK AT IT \u2014 Senate Minority Leader is back in his office today, following an injury he sustained last month while exercising. The Nevada Democrat broke bones in his face and four ribs, and told KNPR State of Nevada that he might permanently lose sight in his right eye.

People talked about terrorism twice as much as the next-highest subject in Facebook chatter about the State of the Union from Jan. 11-17.The rest of the top 10 topics: 2) Obamacare; 3) Immigration; 4) Jobs and the Economy; 5) Israel and Palestine; 6) Taxes; 7) Community College Funding; 8) The NSA; 9) ISIS; 10) Paid Sick Leave.Obama will likely address the U.S. military\u2019s air campaign in Syria and Iraq against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant targets, as well as the greater fight against global terrorism following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris earlier this month.10:15 a.m. DEMPSEY TO MISS SOTU \u2014 Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey will not attend tonight\u2019s State of the Union address, the Pentagon announced. He is in Belgium attending NATO meetings. Vice Chairman Adm. Sandy Winnefeld will attend Obama\u2019s speech.10:10 a.m. ERNST ALL SMILES \u2014 Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst doesn\u2019t seem too nervous as she prepares to deliver the Republican response to Obama\u2019s speech, in an image posted on House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s Twitter account.10:00 a.m. GOP SENATORS RESPOND TO OBAMA COMMUNITY COLLEGE PLAN \u2014 Three Republican senators wrote an op-ed today advocating an alternative plan to the White House proposal to make two years of community college free for all students. Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Ben Sasse of Nebraska \u2014 all former university professors \u2014 advocated in USA Today for their plan to simplify the financial aid process without increasing federal spending. \"Community colleges are the best buy and the most nimble part of higher education,\" the senators wrote. \"If you want to change those two things, the surest way to do that is a new federal program that misses the mark.\"9:30 a.m. SO, ABOUT THAT MIDDLE-CLASS TAX PROPOSAL ... \u2014 Your thoughts on Obama\u2019s tax plan that he will discuss at length this evening, key Republican committee chairmen?\u2014 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), today: \"[The plan] appears to be more about redistribution, with added complexity and class warfare, directed at job-creating small businesses than about tax reform.\"\u2014 Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), yesterday: \"[W]e see now what the president had mind: a $320 billion tax hike on savings and investment, largely to fuel more Washington spending \u2013 and make the tax code even more complex. One word comes to mind. Seriously?\"9:10 a.m. THE SURVIVOR SWEEPSTAKES \u2014 Every year, the president designates one Cabinet member to stay behind from the State of the Union address and away from Capitol Hill in case of a catastrophic event. Philip Bump of The Washington Post, using data from the UCSB American Presidency Project, takes a look at the last three decades of survivors. Six Interior and six Agriculture secretaries have stuck behind in the last 30 years, tied for the highest number.Obama has picked his Energy secretary the past two years \u2014Steven Chu in 2013 and Ernest Moniz in 2014.8:45 a.m. HOW LONG WILL HE TALK? \u2014 Several strategists told POLITICO\u2019s Kendall Breitman to expect a relatively short State of the Union address this evening. But CBS News White House correspondent and unofficial White House record-keeper Mark Knoller notes that history indicates Obama\u2019s speech will probably last at least an hour.Correction: Pres Obama's 2nd SOTU Address was his longest: 1 hr 26 mins. His 4th was shortest: 1 hr. Average length: 1 hr 9 mins. \u2014 Mark Knoller (@markknoller) January 20, 20158:20 a.m. POETRY VS. PROSE \u2014 A fascinating nugget from this great Michael S. Schmidt profile of Cody Keenan, the oft-bearded speechwriter who drafted tonight\u2019s speech, centers on the president\u2019s shift in rhetorical style. Schmidt contrasts Keenan with former chief speechwriter Jon Favreau, who wrote for Obama during his first campaign and throughout his first term. While Favreau was responsible for much of Obama\u2019s soaring oratory the earned him significant attention at the beginning of his career, Keenan\u2019s grittier, more blue-collar prose has defined much of the president\u2019s tone in the dog days of his second term.\"Keenan, the president\u2019s chief speechwriter for nearly all of the second term, is a different breed from his predecessor, Jon Favreau, who was known for his ability to write lofty, big-picture speeches about hope and change,\" Schmidt writes. \"Mr. Keenan focuses far more on individual, hard-work stories as parables for what is difficult but still possible in America.\"8:00 a.m. IN THE FLOTUS BOX \u2014 First lady Michelle Obama will be hosting more than 20 guests for the speech this evening, the White House announced yesterday. They include:\u2014 Alan Gross, a contractor who spent five years imprisoned in Cuba before the White House secured his release last month as part of the deal between the two countries.\u2014 Dr. Pranav Shetty, who oversaw two Ebola treatment units in Liberia in August and will go to Guinea later this week to help fight the disease there.\u2014 Larry Merlo, CEO of CVS Health, the first major pharmacy to ban tobacco sales.\u2014 Ana Zamora, a DREAMer finishing up her last year of college at Northwood University in Texas.\u2014 Catherine Pugh, Maryland Senate majority leader and president-elect of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators.For the full list, go here.7:30 a.m. DUELING NARRATIVES: WHO\u2019S IN CHARGE? \u2014 Good morning from Washington, D.C., where the White House and congressional Republicans are already squaring off over the importance of tonight\u2019s speech. In many ways, the back-and-forth over tonight\u2019s State of the Union address is another battle in the larger turf war between the GOP and the Obama administration following the November midterms.As POLITICO\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere reports, the White House is hoping to build on the president\u2019s momentum from the last two months to make a simple point: He\u2019s still very much relevant, even as a lame duck. \"[T]here\u2019s really only one thing Obama is trying to get across: He\u2019s still here,\" Dovere writes. The White House has resisted ceding ground to congressional Republicans since their midterm victory, instead going on the offense with an immigration executive order, normalizing relations with Cuba, a climate deal with China and a middle-class tax plan he will discuss at length tonight. Obama, who seems somewhat liberated following the election, has an approval rating of 50 percent for the first time in about a year and a half, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.But congressional Republicans are already downplaying tonight\u2019s address as \"just another presidential speech,\" John Bresnahan and Manu Raju report: \"They\u2019re giving the president his turn in the spotlight \u2014 but that\u2019s about it. They say there\u2019s very little chance it will change their agenda, and on Wednesday they\u2019re getting back to business by pushing the bills they want to,\" they write. Republicans have their own set of priorities \u2014 reining in Obama on immigration and Iran, putting a Keystone XL pipeline bill on the president\u2019s desk, taking aim at the Affordable Care Act \u2014 that they plan to push aggressively with majorities in both chambers.We\u2019ll continue to monitor this dynamic between the White House and congressional GOP throughout the day and into this evening.", "answers": {"answer_start": [41321], "text": ["at least an hour"]}, "id": "557638847367249921"}, {"question": "Science Says This Is The Best Movie To Watch On A Date", "context": "The best movie to watch with someone you\u2019d like to see naked isn\u2019t a romcom or a comedy\u2014it\u2019s a horror flick.

It had contacted its British rival again on Saturday, seeking to discuss further a takeover.The chase was welcomed by investors in both companies, as deal-making grips the healthcare industry. AstraZeneca shares were up 11.7 percent at $76.69 in New York on news of the latest offer, which would be the biggest foreign acquisition of a British company and one of the largest pharmaceutical deals. Pfizer shares were up 3.8 percent at $31.92 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday afternoon.AstraZeneca said Pfizer's suggested offer undervalued the company \"very significantly,\" adding that Pfizer wanted to pay 70 percent in shares and only 30 percent in cash. AstraZeneca urged its shareholders to take no action and said it remained confident of its independent strategy.\"I feel pretty confident of a higher bid coming,\" said Neil Veitch, global and UK investment director at SVM Asset Management, which owns AstraZeneca shares. \"I think it's more likely than not that we'll see an agreed deal somewhere in that 52 to 53 pound range.\"Buying AstraZeneca would boost Pfizer's pipeline of cancer drugs and create significant cost and tax savings. Under British takeover rules, Pfizer has until May 26 to announce a firm intention to make an offer or back away.The renewed approach comes amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the sector, pushing the value of deals to $153 billion so far this year, as the industry restructures amid healthcare spending cuts and competition from cheap generics.\"Society wants products faster, they want more products and they want value,\" Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read told reporters. \"Industry is responding to society's request for increased efficiencies and productivity.\"Read said AstraZeneca had declined to engage in talks and the U.S. group was now considering how to proceed, but he remained convinced that combining the two companies made strategic sense and would benefit AstraZeneca investors.NEW DRUG PIPELINESPfizer's original proposal, made to the board of AstraZeneca on Jan. 5, would have valued AstraZeneca shares at 46.61 pounds each - a premium of around 30 percent at the time.AstraZeneca said the proposal comprised 13.98 pounds in cash and 1.758 Pfizer shares for each AstraZeneca share.\"My guess is it will go for somewhere between 50 and 55 (pounds a share),\" said Dan Mahony, a fund manager at Polar Capital, who raised his stake in AstraZeneca in February last year. \"I doubt Pfizer will want to go completely hostile.\"Most of Pfizer's past deals have been conducted on a friendly basis, including its 2009 purchase of Wyeth for $68 billion. But it has been willing to play hardball if needed, as it did in 2000 with its $90 billion purchase of U.S. rival Warner-Lambert, with which it won full ownership of cholesterol fighter Lipitor, the best-selling drug of all time.Read told U.S. analysts that since the initial approach to AstraZeneca, both companies had seen experimental drugs fare well in trials. At the same time, Pfizer concluded it was too difficult to pursue big deals domestically while being on the hook for higher U.S. tax rates.\"We're coming from a position of strength, on our near-term pipeline\" of experimental drugs, Read said.Recent favorable data includes results for Pfizer's experimental breast cancer medicine palbociclib.INDEPENDENT FUTUREPfizer's declaration turns up the heat under AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, who has been in the job since October 2012 and who made clear last week he saw an independent future for the group, flagging spin-offs of two noncore units as one option to create more value.Soriot has been credited with reviving AstraZeneca's previously thin pipeline of new drugs, badly needed to offset a wave of patent expiries on older drugs, and shares in the group have now risen more than 60 percent under his tenure.However, his overhaul - including an ambitious plan to move the company's research and corporate headquarters to Cambridge, England - is still a work in progress and he has also come under fire from some shareholders over executive pay.Read said it was premature to say who would lead a combined company.Buying AstraZeneca would give Pfizer a number of promising - though still risky - experimental cancer medicines known as immunotherapies that boost the body's immune system to fight tumors. It could also generate significant cost savings for the U.S. group.Acquiring a foreign company also makes sense for Pfizer as it has tens of billions of dollars accumulated through foreign subsidiaries, which, if repatriated, would be heavily taxed.The drugmaker has more recently been divesting certain operations, while mega-mergers had fallen out of fashion in the pharmaceuticals industry following scepticism about how well some of them have worked.HEFTY RETURNBut CEO Read said large deals could also make good sense and buying AstraZeneca would \"maintain the flexibility for the potential future separation of our businesses.\"The transaction would complement both Pfizer's innovative drug businesses and also its established products business - comprising older and off-patent medicines - which many analysts expect to be eventually spun off.In addition to using offshore cash, buying AstraZeneca would be tax-efficient since Pfizer could redomicile to Britain and enjoy lower tax rates, thanks to attractive incentives to companies that manufacture and hold patents in the country.Pfizer envisages combining the two drugmakers under a new UK-incorporated holding company, although the head office and stock market listing would remain in New York. But the suggested deal has triggered worries about jobs in Britain's drug sector, viewed as a key industry by the government.AstraZeneca has already laid off thousands of staff as it shrinks its cost base to cope with a fall in sales due to patent losses on blockbuster medicines, while Pfizer has shuttered a research site in Sandwich, southern England.Read said Pfizer had contacted the British government about its plans on Monday, after Finance Minister George Osborne said on Friday that any deal was \"a commercial matter between the companies\".A spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters on Monday that any Pfizer takeover bid would be assessed by \"independent procedures and frameworks.\"Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Guggenheim Securities are advising Pfizer, while Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Evercore Partners are working for AstraZeneca.

And the worst global meltdown since the Great Depression got rolling in 2007 with the failure of mortgage lenders Northern Rock in the U.K. and New Century Financial in the U.S.You can\u2019t really mark the next crisis down on your calendar, of course. The point is that crackups come fairly regularly. And some of the prerequisites for the next one do seem to be falling into place.The International Monetary Fund may have gotten things about right in its annual Global Financial Stability Report, which was issued in October. It doesn\u2019t sound an alarm but expresses concern. Short-term risks have actually abated, the IMF says, pointing to rebounding commodity prices, which help some key emerging markets, and the prospect of easier money in developed markets. But, it says, \"medium-term risks continue to build.\" It cites the unsettled political climate, which makes entrenched problems harder to tackle; some weak financial institutions in developed markets; and heavy corporate debts in emerging markets.Risks that aren\u2019t acute can build for a while before triggering a crisis. What\u2019s indisputable is that debt, the tinder of almost every financial conflagration, is growing rapidly. At 225 percent of world gross domestic product, combined public and private debt outside the financial sector \"is currently at an all-time high,\" the IMF says. Debt fuels growth but also makes borrowers brittle. Debtors keep owing money even if they lose the ability to repay. If they default, their lenders are damaged and sometimes default on their own obligations, and so the dominoes fall.The world\u2019s banks are mostly stronger now than they were on the eve of the last financial crisis, but there are important exceptions. The stock of Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s biggest, has fallen 62 percent from its 2015 high, and Chief Executive Officer John Cryan has so far resisted an obvious solution to shore up the bank, namely raising money by issuing new shares, which would dilute the ownership of current shareholders. The German government, having inveighed against bailouts for southern European banks, is insisting it won\u2019t reverse course now for its own bank. In Italy, meanwhile, troubled loans on banks\u2019 books equal about one-quarter of the nation\u2019s GDP.Even in the U.S., investors don\u2019t appear to regard big banks as any safer now than they were before the last crisis, according to a paper issued by former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Natasha Sarin, a Harvard graduate student. The stock prices of the big U.S. banks are uncomfortably low, Summers and Sarin say, which implies that their \"franchise value\" has been eroded. That suggests that in a crisis they might have a hard time paying off their debts by liquidating assets.Ultralow interest rates aren\u2019t helping banks\u2019 ability to withstand a crisis. They squeeze profits\u2014which banks need to build up their safety cushion\u2014by reducing the amount banks can earn on the loans they make. It\u2019s not only the level of rates but also the small difference between the short-term rates at which banks borrow and the long-term rates at which they lend.Two regulations that take effect in 2018 will begin to pinch in 2017 as banks prepare to comply with them. One, from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, strictly limits the amount of leverage that banks can use to make money. Another requires them to recognize expected loan losses more quickly. Although the rules should make banks safer, they could also further reduce their profits. If banks keep trying to thread the needle\u2014scraping by without turning to shareholders for more capital\u2014they could become even more vulnerable.Whatever the stresses on conventional banks, they probably pose less of a risk than the shadow banking system, says Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Standish, a unit of BNY Mellon. The \"design failure\" of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to reform Wall Street is that by raising the cost of operating a conventional bank, it pushed some money toward less regulated shadow banks, Reinhart says. The shadow banking system includes hedge funds, money-market mutual funds, and Wall Street securities lenders and borrowers.China may be the scariest source of risk on the horizon. Its growth rate has been driven by unsustainably rapid expansion of lending to businesses and households, says Bloomberg Intelligence Chief Asia Economist Tom Orlik. The government has signaled, through an editorial in the state-run press, that it wants the country to start deleveraging. \"So far it is not clear if words will be matched with deeds,\" Orlik wrote on Oct. 11.Chinese banks are \"the major risk, a potential detonator,\" says Samuel Malone, director of specialized modeling at Moody\u2019s Analytics. He looked at the size, fragility, and interconnectedness of the world\u2019s biggest banks and concluded that China\u2019s Southeast Asian neighbors, particularly Singapore, are most directly exposed. China\u2019s shadow banking system is huge and poorly understood, and the losses that it suffers could quickly be transmitted to conventional banks.", "answers": {"answer_start": [4378], "text": ["China"]}, "id": "812627298172239872"}, {"question": "Guess how much a beer costs at #SB50...nope, it's higher:", "context": "If you can drop $4,600 on a Super Bowl ticket, you'll have no problem spending $13 on a bottle of domestic light beer, right?

The image was discovered Sunday that Donald Trump's Twitter wasn't the first place the meme appeared.

Doing so allows you to see the thread on /pol/ as it originally existed.Of note is the file name of the photo, HillHistory.jpg, potentially a nod to the Neo-Nazi code for \"HH,\" or \"Heil Hitler,\" which the alt-right is fond of hiding in plain sight.The image also appeared on a Twitter account that regularly tweets violent, racist memes commenting on the state of geopolitical politics.Other examples of images tweeted by this account include violent propaganda about Muslims and refugees and racist images of Clinton:Mic previously reported white supremacists rally on the internet to expose what they believe to be a vast anti-white conspiracy, centuries old, in which Jews have paid off politicians and infiltrated the media to undermine Western society from the top down. The Clinton meme Trump tweeted \u2014 which first appeared on perhaps the biggest bastion of the anti-Semitic alt-right \u2014 has brought that same hateful paranoia into the mainstream.One relationship of particular importance to their \"anti-White conspiracy\" is that between Jewish reporters and Hillary Clinton , whom they believe to be working in tandem to undermine the Western world, preventing nations like the U.S. from becoming more like their vision of utopia \u2014 a nation with racial purity among its core values.Trump has since deleted the meme and in its place uploaded an alteration that replaces the Star of David with a circle.In November, Trump retweeted a meme perpetuating the racist lie explicitly that black people committed more violent crimes against white people than any other race.

The man-child schtick is such a comedy trope in American cinema that it has even crossed the gender divide in Apatow female-led vehicles like Bridesmaids and Trainwreck.Take a look at a list of the best comedies made in the last 20 years and a large percentage of them will follow this pattern \u2013 perhaps perfected in Step Brothers \u2013 and there\u2019s no denying that Sandler was a part of this.

Well, there are several possible theories...It\u2019s Some Kind Of Weird Performance Art To Deliberately Ruin His CareerUniversalFed up with making lowbrow but endearing comedies and tired of the Hollywood system, Sandler now only makes irredeemably awful films as some kind of weird performance art.Doing what\u2019s known in the industry as \u2018the Eddie Murphy\u2019, he is hellbent on torpedoing his entire career as some kind of commentary on the fickle nature of celebrity by making piss-poor films where he plays multiple characters, puts on a weird accent, and/or does drag (Jack & Jill).Each film he makes will become more elaborately unnecessary than the last, until the release of his magnum opus \u2013 a film in which Sandler plays every single character and nothing happens except him walking around a mansion wearing clown make-up and a fat suit, slipping on banana skins and farting for seven straight hours.It\u2019ll be like a vomit-flecked Disneyland version of Waiting For Godot, that instead of making you laugh, makes you question the very value of laughter itself in a world bereft of meaning.Then, as a final salvo, he catches a glimpse of his own reflection in a mirror and uses that patented Sandler aggression to fist fight his own bloodied reflection while laughing and crying at the same time.He Just Stopped CaringNetflixAlternatively, maybe he\u2019s just become jaded and cynical with how poorly his films are received, and as a big middle finger to critics, he\u2019ll star in literally anything that will guarantee him $10 million and a portion of the gross.He\u2019s now just a kind of Adam Sandler automaton who roams from film set to film set, dancing on cue with a glazed faraway look in his eye until the director yells cut or an assistant comes along to drive him home.Maybe He Can Just No Longer Tell Good From BadColombia PicturesIt could be that after nearly three decades in Hollywood, Sandler is just no longer able to tell what\u2019s actually good from bad.There\u2019s a chance he read/wrote Pixels/Don\u2019t Mess With The Zohan/Grown Ups/Jack & Jill and genuinely thought they\u2019d be funny and not the cinematic equivalent of urinating into your own face.It Doesn\u2019t Matter, He Still Made Some ClassicsNew Line CinemaAt the end of the day, like every great band or actor who were once relevant and made great films or music but have now fallen out of favour, we can always remember Sandler for The Wedding Singer, Big Daddy and Happy Gilmore.And be thankful that, before he started bottle-feeding us his own warm piss, he made some damned funny films.Happy Birthday Adam!", "answers": {"answer_start": [2358], "text": ["somewhere around 2005"]}, "id": "52geyu"}, {"question": "Find out what made Marian Rivera ditch her usual alluring poses!", "context": "- During Marian Rivera\u2019s lifestyle talk show, she visited a 3D museum located in Quezon City and gamely posed for the cameras- The actress was commended for funnily posing like a child in the different art pieces- The 3D art museum she visited is the largest one in Asia when it comes to the number of 3D paintings availableKapuso Primetime Queen Marian Rivera didn\u2019t feel shy and went all out while posing animatedly beside the 3D attractions in an art museum in Cubao, Quezon City.The 31-year old actress visited \u2018Art in Island\u2019 for her lifestyle-morning talk show, \u2018Yan ang Morning!\u2019As part of the TV program, Rivera visits a lot of attractions daily.

These days, Monsanto's seeds make up 23% of the global vegetable seed market.The company's non-GMO crop research happens on a California campus that's filled with greenhouses, test vegetable plots, and lab equipment.\"The biggest part of the business is tomatoes and peppers.

In colonial America, hard cider was more popular than whiskey, wine, and beer; scholars estimate that 18th-century residents of Virginia and Massachusetts were each drinking between 15 and 35 gallons of the stuff a year. During the 19th century, though, consumption declined, and the spirit never quite recovered after the era of prohibition.Today hard cider accounts for roughly 1% of the US beer market, according to Dan Rowell, CEO of the Vermont Hard Cider Company, whose Woodchuck Hard Cider is one of the top-selling American brands. But Rowell and other cider makers are witnessing a veritable boom in business, perhaps owing to a deepening interest in craft brews and the wave of adults seeking gluten-free alternatives. Like beverages brewed from grains, fermented apple juice comes in many tastes, and it\u2019s just as ripe for small-scale, local appeal.Rowell recently told the Los Angeles Times that he predicts cider will capture 5% of the beer market before 2020. A new Woodchuck Hard Cider processing facility opened in Vermont in August; it\u2019s 100,000 square feet and reportedly can fill and cap 600 bottles of cider a minute.Since 2009, hard cider has been the fastest-growing segment in the alcoholic beverage industry.Accordingly, big companies like MillerCoors and Heineken are getting in on cider pressing. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world\u2019s largest beer company, introduced Stella Artois Cidre in 2013 and Johnny Appleseed hard cider in March 2014. Analysts predict that Boston Beer Co., which makes Samuel Adams beers, will owe a fifth of its sales volume to its Angry Orchard brand of cider by the end of 2015. Angry Orchard has climbed past European brands such as Magner\u2019s Irish Cider to become the top-selling cider brand in the US. (Surprisingly, though, the Boston Globe reports that Angry Orchard makes its cider from apples harvested in Italy and France. That may be because there aren\u2019t enough cider-worthy apples in America to meet the increased demand.)Some cider makers are hoping for policy changes related to the way alcoholic beverages are labeled in the US, arguing that current rules make the definition of \"cider\" too narrow. It can have only 7% alcohol by volume before being taxed as wine, and can only be lightly carbonated before being taxed as sparkling wine. Cider makers have said this is too fine a line to walk, especially since it\u2019s tricky to predict exactly how alcoholic their experimental small batches will be. They\u2019re lobbying to have the federal definition of hard cider changed to accommodate 8.5% alcohol by volume and to mimic EU standards on carbonation. Alcoholic cider has been popular in the UK for at least a decade and reportedly accounts for 15% of the beer market there.", "answers": {"answer_start": [127], "text": ["hard cider"]}, "id": "514470166789632000"}, {"question": "How cruise liners fill all their unsold cabins", "context": "How Cruise Liners Fill All Their Unsold Cruise CabinsWhat could be better than a cruise for relaxation and luxury?Premium food, premium services and shows and entertainment worthy of Las Vegas are all just part of the deal when you book a cruise.

Even less time than previously thought, a scientist reveals.A scenario often presented to introductory physics classes is that of a \"gravity tunnel\" \u2014 a tube drilled from one side of the Earth to the other through the planet's center. The answer taught for nearly a half-century for how long a fall through such a hole would take was about 42 minutes and 12 seconds.The solution to this problem depends on the strength of Earth's gravitational pull, which in turn is based on its mass. As one falls through the planet, there is less mass beneath whoever is making the descent over time, so the force of the gravity experienced would lessen as one approached Earth's center. [What If? 22 Crazy Hypothetical Questions (and their Answers)]Still, assuming no air resistance, the momentum from the fall could sling one all the way to the surface on the other side. Anyone making the fall would have to make sure to get away from the exit hole as soon as they flew out of it, or else they could drop in again, hurtling back and forth inside the gravity tunnel, like a weight swinging at the end of a pendulum.\"I guess you can imagine it like a waterslide that takes about 40 minutes to fall through that takes you to speeds over 8 kilometers per second (17,895 mph),\" said physicist Alexander Klotz at McGill University in Montreal. \"Halfway through the ride, gravity would switch directions and you'd go from right-side up to upside down. You'd have to grab onto the other end or else you'd fall back down the way you came. If the waterslide was made of glass, it would be like zooming through a sea of lava.\"Still, at least one major unrealistic assumption dogged this calculation ever since it was first made in 1966. Ignoring for a moment how drilling a hole about 7,918 miles (12,742 kilometers) long through the Earth is virtually impossible, the problem with the 42-minute solution was that it assumed the planet was uniform in density throughout like a marble.Now, using a more realistic model of the Earth, Klotz finds the fall would take only about 38 minutes and 11 seconds, about 4 minutes faster than thought.Klotz based his calculations on the internal structure of the planet as determined from seismic data. While the Earth's crust has a density less than about 187 lbs. per cubic foot (3 grams per cubic centimeter), Earth's center has a density of about 811 lbs. per cubic foot (13 grams per cubic centimeter). The density of the planet does not rise in a straightforward manner the farther down one goes \u2014 there is a sharp 50 percent increase in density at the boundary of the planet's mantle and its outer core about 1,800 miles (2,900 km) below Earth's surface.The physicist assumed there was no air resistance in the gravity tunnel. \"In my opinion, if you have the technology to dig such a tunnel, you have the technology to suck the air out,\" Klotz said.Surprisingly, Klotz found that he calculated almost the identical answer if he assumed the strength of Earth's gravitational pull was uniform throughout the planet and equal to its value on the surface. This assumption works because Earth's gravity \"only changes by, like, 10 percent as you go deeper \u2014 first stronger, then weaker \u2014 for like the first 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles),\" Klotz said. \"So if you start falling and picking up speed, by the time you reach a region in which gravity is significantly different from its surface value, you are going so fast that you spend very little time in this region.\"Don't expect anyone to test these calculations with a real tunnel through Earth anytime soon.\"The Soviets tried digging as deep a hole as they could from 1970 to 1989 and only got 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) deep, about 0.1 percent of the way through the Earth,\" Klotz said.Klotz detailed his findings in the March issue of the American Journal of Physics.", "answers": {"answer_start": [436], "text": ["42 minutes and 12 seconds"]}, "id": "1100188040002123_1122118304475763"}, {"question": "One of the planet's deadliest ancient diseases could be about to return", "context": "Smallpox \u2013 a deadly disease eradicated from the world in 1977 \u2013 could return as the frozen tundra of Siberia melts and releases the virus from the corpses of people who died in a major epidemic about 120 years ago, experts have warned.The disease was once one of the most feared in the world.

She split her budget into four categories and marked an envelope for each:Rent Money for Anna (Lowry's roommate, who paid the utilities) Savings Fun Fund\"Every time I came home from either of those jobs, I would usually put 50 percent into 'rent,' 25 percent into 'money for Anna,' and then 25 percent into 'savings,'\" she said. Extra cash would go into the \"fun fund\" envelope, which she joked was \"usually pretty empty.\"The 27-year-old said the envelope system is effective because you can see how much money you have in each of your budgets.\"I think it's incredibly helpful to look into your rent envelope and see, 'Hey, it's half way through the month, but I still need $300,'\" she said. \"Or to look into your savings envelope and think, 'Wow, in the last three months I've saved $200.' Especially when you're in a stage in your life where every penny counts.\"The system keeps you focused on your budgets and prevents you from overspending, according Lowry.\"If you're doing it the right way, it should be getting funded more towards the beginning of the month,\" Lowry said. \"You're saying, 'OK this is May 1 and this month I have $300 to be spending on groceries so that by the time you get to May 25, if you only have $30 left, that's all you have left to spend.\"She said it also helps prioritize your budget \"especially if you're trying to get your financial life together.\"\"I think it helps illuminate that what you thought were your priorities aren't based on how you've been spending your money and it can help you redirect and refocus,\" Lowry said.Now a full time author, blogger, and public speaker, Lowry no longer gets paid in cash. She said she still uses the same system, but with multiple checking and savings accounts in place of envelopes.\"It's the exact same system, just digital,\" she explained, noting that many banks will allow you to open multiple accounts. You can automate contributions from your paycheck to a savings account, which makes saving easy, according to the the blogger.\"When I'm logging into my checking, which I do a little more frequently than savings, I'm not seeing my savings there, so I'm not tempted to pull money out,\" Lowry said.While Lowry achieved her financial goals, there is one thing she regrets: not putting enough in her \"fun fund.\"\"I'm thankful I had that experience, but I'm also now trying to be a little bit better about finding balance in my life and saying yes sometimes and not solely always focusing on making money,\" Lowry concluded.", "answers": {"answer_start": [67], "text": ["envelopes"]}, "id": "854922676997173248"}, {"question": "\u2018It\u2019s Something I\u2019m Still Processing\u2019: Hillary Clinton on Winning, and Why Her Mother Would Be Nervous", "context": "A day after claiming her party\u2019s nomination for president, an exhilarated Hillary Clinton said she was \"still processing\" the emotions of the moment on Wednesday as she heard from people around the globe both excited about her success and deeply anxious about her Republican rival, Donald J. TrumpIn a brief but at times introspective interview, Mrs. Clinton said that although other countries have been led by women, such a milestone would be different were it to happen in the United States. She called the demands of the American political system more personally grueling and difficult.\"I really believe our system is probably the most challenging in the world,\" Mrs. Clinton said. \"If you\u2019re a prime minister, you\u2019re chosen by your peers,\" she continued. \"If you\u2019re president, you run statewide, but it\u2019s usually with the backing of a party and you don\u2019t have to raise the money to run.\"But, she added, \"Women candidates all face the same scrutiny, and questions about ourselves, so there are similarities.\"The implications of her claiming the Democratic nomination for president \u2014 the first woman to do so for a major American political party \u2014 became clear quickly for Mrs. Clinton, 68, in recent days. Prominent women and many male leaders have \"reached out to me in recent days to encourage me and say how much this election means to their country and the world.\"\"It\u2019s something I\u2019m still processing,\" Mrs. Clinton added.Her comments came days before Mr. Trump plans to give a major speech seeking to revive the scandals of the 1990s that entangled Mrs. Clinton and her husband, Bill, and criticize the foundation the family has run. She vowed not to respond to his personal attacks and said she would continue to use his words against him.\"I am responding to his very apparent lack of qualifications to be president based on what he has said and done and the temperamentally unfit person he is,\" Mrs. Clinton said.She joined Republican leaders including Speaker Paul D. Ryan in denouncing Mr. Trump\u2019s comments last week that a Mexican-American judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel of United States District Court, had been biased against Mr. Trump because of his heritage.Mrs. Clinton went beyond her previous characterization of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, saying on Wednesday that his attack on Judge Curiel based on his ethnicity was \"an outrageous, racist attack.\"But even as Mrs. Clinton tried to portray a steely fortitude in facing Mr. Trump, and a determination not to allow his personal attacks to get her off course, she offered a glimpse of the toll that reliving some of her lowest and most publicly humiliating moments would take.Throughout her second presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton has drawn on the inspiration of her mother, Dorothy Rodham, who was born into poverty and neglect and taught her daughter, from an early age, to confront bullies and stand up for herself.\"She was such a stalwart support in every way, mostly personal, but she would have been excited; she would have been proud,\" Mrs. Clinton said about how Mrs. Rodham would have viewed the events of the past few days.But, Mrs. Clinton also suggested that her mother would be eager to protect her from the attacks to come. \"She might have been a little apprehensive,\" she said. \"This is a very big step.\"Mrs. Clinton offered a vigorous defense of a decision which has haunted her primary campaign \u2014 her acceptance of large amounts of money for giving speeches to Wall Street banks, a practice that even her most ardent supporters have viewed as puzzlingly self-defeating.Mrs. Clinton called such speeches that garner six-figure fees \"the norm\" for previous secretaries of state. \"I actually think it makes sense,\" she added.When pressed on why, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and the Occupy Wall Street movement, she chose to give such speeches, Mrs. Clinton reiterated that she had put forth \"the most specific plan\" of any candidate to regulate the financial industry.\"A lot of people know you have a front-row seat in what is going on in the world, so maybe you have some interesting observations about political or economic concerns,\" Mrs. Clinton explained. \"That to me is how it came about, and that\u2019s what I talked about when I was making speeches.\"During the interview, Mrs. Clinton seemed almost to be trying to grapple with the meaning of her achievement and the overall restive mood of the country. She seemed also to be wrestling with themes she publicly raised, at times to mockery, in her early years in the White House \u2014 about whether the country has lost its sense of larger mission and community.\"It\u2019s important people feel like they\u2019re part of a larger national purpose,\" Mrs. Clinton said. \"It makes a big difference if people have jobs with dignity and purpose.\"\"I\u2019ve thought a lot and spoken about, from time to time,\" the need for more \"love and kindness.\" Or, as she put it in 1993, drawing on the reflections of the Republican operative Lee Atwater as he faced death, \"a little heart, a lot of brotherhood.\"\"I think in this campaign I\u2019ve tried to raise some of those themes again,\" she continued.Now that she has finished a primary battle that stretched on far longer than she expected, Mrs. Clinton, speaking from her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., planned to visit the local bookstore.\"I\u2019ll finally have a break where I\u2019ll have some time,\" she said. \"I love to wander around bookstores and see what strikes my fancy.\"She pointed to one book she had read recently that she said would stay with her through the general election: the swimmer Diana Nyad\u2019s memoir, \"Find a Way,\" about her nearly 111-mile swim at age 64 from Cuba to Florida.\"When you\u2019re facing big challenges in your life, you can think about Diana Nyad getting attacked by the lethal sting of box jellyfishes,\" she said. \"And nearly anything else seems doable in comparison.\"Asked if Mr. Trump would be her \"box jellyfish\" over the coming months, Mrs. Clinton let out a hearty laugh, then demurred. \"I don\u2019t know about that,\" she said.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1674], "text": ["personal attacks"]}, "id": "4nakaz"}, {"question": "This melting glacier kept an ancient secret...", "context": "By Laura Poppick, LiveScience Staff Writer:An ancient forest has thawed from under a melting glacier in Alaska and is now exposed to the world for the first time in more than 1,000 years.Stumps and logs have been popping out from under southern Alaska's Mendenhall Glacier \u2014 a 36.8-square-mile (95.3 square kilometers) river of ice flowing into a lake near Juneau \u2014 for nearly the past 50 years. However, just within the past year or so, researchers based at the University of Alaska Southeast in Juneau have noticed considerably more trees popping up, many in their original upright position and some still bearing roots and even a bit of bark, the Juneau Empire first reported last week.\"There are a lot of them, and being in a growth position is exciting because we can see the outermost part of the tree and count back to see how old the tree was,\" Cathy Connor, a geology professor at the University of Alaska Southeast who was involved in the investigation, told LiveScience's OurAmazingPlanet. \"Mostly, people find chunks of wood helter-skelter, but to see these intact upright is kind of cool.\"Stumps have been thawing from beneath the Mendenhall Glacier for about 50 years, but recently, considerably more have been found in upright positions with roots still intact. Credit: Jamie BradshawThe team has tentatively identified the trees as either spruce or hemlock, based on the diameter of the trunks and because these are the types of trees growing in the region today, Connor said, but the researchers still need to further assess the samples to verify the tree type.A protective tomb of gravel likely encased the trees more than 1,000 years ago, when the glacier was advancing, Connor said, basing the date on radiocarbon ages of the newly revealed wood. As glaciers advance, Connor explained, they often emit summer meltwater streams that spew aprons of gravel beyond the glacier's edge. [Images: Shrinking Alaska Glacier Spied from Space]A gravel layer about 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 meters) high appears to have encased the trees before the glacier ultimately advanced enough to plow over them, snapping off limbs and preserving the stumps in an ice tomb.Taku Glacier, located south of Juneau, is currently triggering this same process as it advances over a modern forest of cottonwood trees, offering the researchers a chance to observe the process in real time, Connor said.Unlike the growing Taku Glacier, which accumulates snow at a high elevation and thus is well situated to grow, the lower-elevation Mendenhall Glacier has retreated by an average rate of about 170 feet (52 m) per year since 2005. This year's summer retreat has not yet been calculated, but the team expects it to be relatively high due to unusually warm summer temperatures, Connor said.Researchers have collected pieces of wood to date using radiocarbon dating techniques, and have found that the forest is more than 1,000 years old. Credit: Jamie BradshawGlacial retreat worries many locals who are concerned about the threat of rising sea levels and loss of major freshwater sources that they rely on for drinking water. Anchorage, the state's most populated city, relies entirely on the retreating Eklutna Glacier for its drinking water.Still, glacial retreat does offer an interesting opportunity to investigate well-preserved remnants of an ancient world. The team plans to return to the Mendenhall Glacier to dig through sediment in search of pine needles associated with the trees, along with other vegetation. They also plan to measure the growth bands of the trees to determine how old the trees were when they died.\"These are relict stories, and piecing them together with radiocarbon dating and stratigraphic work would help piece together the chapters of the story,\" Connor said.The researchers have not yet published the results from the investigation but plan to do so once they have gathered more data.Copyright 2013 LiveScience, a TechMediaNetwork company.

I typically drink far more than the recommended six to eight glasses per day, and feel dehydrated if I adhere to the guidelines. I have no underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, that would lead to increased thirst.Absolutely, and if you do, you can develop a dangerous condition called hyponatremia, or water intoxication.Under normal conditions, the body beautifully maintains its fluid balance. Lose fluids through sweating, for instance, and your body responds with the feeling of thirst. You drink. If you swallow more liquid than needed just then, your body typically responds by excreting the excess through urination.But should you consume so much fluid that your body can\u2019t easily rid itself of the surplus, you dilute sodium levels in your blood. Osmosis then draws water from the blood into body cells to equalize sodium levels, and those cells swell. At that point, you have hyponatremia. If the cellular bloating occurs in the brain, it can be fatal.Until about 20 years ago, hyponatremia was extremely uncommon among healthy people. But then several marathon runners died from hyponatremia. In general, they had been middle- or back-of-the-pack, slower runners. They did not sweat much. But they drank plenty of water, trying to ensure that they would be well hydrated.Today, most knowledgeable coaches and exercise experts warn athletes not to overdrink. \"You should drink only when you need to, when you are actually thirsty,\" said Dr. James Winger, a professor of family medicine at Loyola University Medical Center, who has studied the hydration habits of athletes.If you\u2019re not sure whether you\u2019re drinking too much or too little during exercise, try weighing yourself before and after a lengthy workout, experts advise. If you have lost more than about 3 or 4 percent of your body weight, you\u2019re probably flirting with dehydration and might want to drink a bit more next time. But if you have gained weight or your fingers seem swollen and your rings tight, you\u2019re most likely drinking too much and should moderate intake.Most important, listen to your body\u2019s signals, Dr. Winger said. \"Thirst is a very reliable indicator,\" he said, of whether and how much to drink.", "answers": {"answer_start": [264], "text": ["Absolutely"]}, "id": "611997343676792832"}, {"question": "Which #Community actor is responsible for @danharmon's return?", "context": "Fans of \"Community\" are excited about the return of series creator Dan Harmon, and they have series stars Joel McHale and Jim Rash to thank for his return.Harmon, the creator of \"Community\" gave up his show when Sony (the company that produces the series) and NBC fired him and brought on David Guarascio and Moses Port who were producers on ABC's \"Happy Endings.\" Then in an unprecedented move, they re-hired Harmon for \"Community's\" upcoming fifth season.When speaking with the New York Times, McHale, who plays Jeff Winger on the series hinted at his frustration with the fourth season. \"The scripts don\u2019t just come out of stories and jokes,\" said McHale. \"They come out of real meaning, and real characters that crazy stuff happens to.\"The New York Times also reports that it was McHale and Rash (who plays Dean Pelton on the series) are the ones fans should thank for bringing Harmon back to \"Community.\" The two actors met with Sony and NBC for months before Harmon finally met with Chris McKenna, an executive producer on \"Community\" about returning for a 13-episode fifth season.The upcoming fifth season of \"Community\" will premiere Jan. 2 on NBC.", "answers": {"answer_start": [106], "text": ["Joel McHale"]}, "id": "413402801742426112"}, {"question": "This might be the most shocking thing @Courtney Love has ever done", "context": "In case you needed a brief refresher, this was Courtney Love circa 1995 ...Girl would wake up every day and smear lipstick on her general face area.Well, guess what?

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), sexual interests fall into two categories: normal (normophilic) and anomalous (paraphilic). Researchers asked 1,040 Quebec residents, representative of the general population, about their experiences of sexual behaviour considered abnormal by the DSM-5. The study, published in The Journal of Sex Research, found that of the eight types of anomalous behaviour listed in the DSM-5, four were found to be neither rare or unusual among the experiences and desires reported by men and womenIt suggests these women exist within a culture that discourages speaking up against unwanted sexual encounters, and where it may even be dangerous to do so.\"It appears that faking orgasm is both problematic and helpful at the same time,\" says Ms Thomas.\"On the one level faking an orgasm may be a useful strategy as it affords some control over ending a sexual encounter.

If you've ever tried homemade pasta, however, you understand what pasta is really all about. Homemade pasta is a little chewy and very tender; it really does just melt in your mouth.It may sound difficult, but making your own pasta is actually much easier than you might think. If you have a pasta maker, the most difficult part is probably setting up the machinery (you can also make pasta by hand). Whichever route you take, homemade is as simple as mixing together two or three ingredients. The basic process consists of mixing flour and water -- and egg if you want -- together, kneading it into dough, letting the dough rest for a while, and cutting noodles.

It's \"simple and forgiving, [and] one of those recipes that\u2019s more about technique than ingredients or quantities.\"If you're still not convinced, here's something to consider: Homemade pasta is so satisfying that it needs little else to make a completely delicious meal, especially if you've added something flavorful, like spinach or beets, to the pasta dough.

(Photo: GABRIELLE LURIE, AFP/Getty Images)Diehard Apple (AAPL) fans are fretting over what will go missing in the newest iPhone. But investors are more worried about something other than an absent headphone jack: The missing enthusiasm for Apple's stock.Shares of Apple are down 0.7% in the 30 days leading up to the 11th iPhone product launch expected Wednesday, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500 index 0.1% increase during the same time.The lackluster stock reaction coming into the smartphone announcement is a departure from previous Apple smartphone launches going back to the original iPhone almost a decade ago.On average, Apple shares have gained 3.8% in the month prior to an announcement. The last iPhone, the shrunken-down and discounted SE, certainly sparked more interest, gaining 10.3% in the 30 days prior to the March 2016 announcement as the S&P 500 rose 6.9%.The lack of excitement is notable given the importance of the product to Apple; iPhone revenue accounted for two-thirds of Apple's revenue last year, according to market research firm Trefis.All this shows investors, despite media hoopla, aren't looking for much from the iPhone 7, says UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a note to clients.\"Investors already anticipate underwhelming iPhone 7 features,\" Milunovich says.Apple's shares are lagging the market ahead of the iPhone 7 launch. (Photo: S&P Global Market Intelligence, USA TODAY via Microsoft Excel)The lackluster run of the stock ahead of the new smartphone announcement is even more disappointing since the stock typically runs into pressure afterwards. Apple's stock has declined an average of 0.6% in the 30 days after the previous iPhone announcements going back to 2007. In the last four cycles, shares of Apple fell 4% in the two weeks after new phones were actually launched and made available, Milunovich says.The smartphone is a mature product and the company's other offerings ranging from watches to tablet computers as well as music and payment services have failed to pick up the slack. Apple's revenue is expected to fall 8% this fiscal year ended in September to $215.4 billion, says S&P Global Market Intelligence. Even with a new smartphone launch, next fiscal year, analysts see revenue inching up just 4%, a fraction of its 28% revenue growth in fiscal 2015 and 31% average revenue growth over the past five fiscal years.Samsung also continues to challenge Apple's cash cow. Apple claimed 75% of the premium-tier smartphone profits in the second quarter, says Michael Walkley, analyst at Canaccord Genuity. But that's down from Apple's 90% share of profit in the first quarter due to Samsung capitalizing on better demand for its Galaxy S7 device, he says.Investors appear to be saying Apple's halcyon days may be over. Shares are down 4% over the past year to $107.70, as of Tuesday's close, while the S&P 500 is up nearly 11%. Investors are paying roughly 12 times for every dollar in earnings the company is expected to post this fiscal year, which is \"similar to other large computer vendors,\" says Milunovich, who is holding his price target on the stock at $115 a share.And that's the bright spot for investors at least hoping the stock will stop falling as expectations are brought down. Consumers waiting to upgrade their phones may finally pay up for the iPhone 7 or new phones launched in 2018, Walkley says. Apple still also has a large captive audience of users to pitch its services to, Walkley says.

But a draft of the new recommendations, subject to final approval, still lists light canned tuna as a low-mercury fish for vulnerable groups.Seafood contains nutrients like protein, iron and omega-3 fatty acids, which are especially vital for the growth and brain development of fetuses, breastfeeding babies and young children. But certain kinds of seafood, especially larger fish, can contain a neurotoxin called methylmercury (commonly referred to as simply \"mercury\") that can cause severe birth defects like blindness, deafness and mental retardation if fetuses are exposed to the metal in utero.Canned tuna was once the most widely-consumed type of seafood in the U.S., and in 2012 still came in second, after shrimp. Despite the rankings, all canned seafood, of which tuna is the leader, dropped to its lowest level in more than 15 years, reports the Washington Post -- perhaps because of health concerns like mercury.Currently, the FDA recommends that pregnant women, women who may become pregnant, nursing mothers and young children also stay away from shark, swordfish, king mackarel and tilefish -- recommendations that Consumer Reports agrees with. But when it comes to the FDA's recommendations of which seafood those groups should eat, the government agency stops short of a comprehensive list, save these suggestions: salmon, shrimp, pollock, tilapia, catfish, cod and light canned tuna, about two to three times a week.To give people a wider selection of low-mercury seafood, CR took the Environmental Protection Agency's data on the average amount of mercury per fish and listed them into two groups: \"Lowest\" mercury and \"Lower\" mercury as part of their report.\"The best fish on the list is salmon,\" said Halloran. \"Virtually all the canned salmon in stores is wild Alaskan salmon, and it's a very good substitute for canned tuna -- it's just a little more work, because you have to take the bones out.\"To see Consumer Report's list of the 17 best seafoods with low mercury levels, check out the slideshow below.Seafood With The Lowest Mercury Levels", "answers": {"answer_start": [194], "text": ["Tuna"]}, "id": "502686552657387521"}, {"question": "Vans x Nintendo sneaker collection gets a release date.", "context": "Vans x Nintendo sneaker collection gets a release date.UPDATE: Vans x Nintendo collaboration are now on sale in the UK at this link.One of my personal favorite Vans collaborations finally gets a release date.

Past studies have examined the relationship between height and lifespan of populations around the world, suggesting that shorter people generally live longer lives, while taller people are more likely to have certain illnesses and develop various types of cancer.Now, thanks to new research published in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers have finally discovered the secret behind shorter people's longevity: It's in their genes.Using data from a long-term observational study of Japanese-American men in Hawaii, researchers demonstrated that a gene linked to longevity, called FOXO3, is also linked to body size. What's more, researchers found that the shorter a person was, the more likely they were to have a long life.In one of the world's largest and longest-running studies of aging men, researchers at the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine, Kuakini Medical Center and U.S. Veterans Affairs ran an analysis by dividing more than 8,000 subjects into two height groups -- 5'2\" and shorter and 5'4\" and taller -- and looking at their heights, health and death rates over a 40 year period.\"The folks who were 5'2\" and shorter lived the longest,\" Dr. Bradley Wilcox, a researcher and professor at the UH Manoa's Department of Geriatric Medicine, told Hawaii News Now. \"They also had lower fasting insulin levels and got less cancer.\"And while 5'2\" is very short -- the average height of an American male is 5'9\" -- the results were heartening for \"taller\" short guys too: Data showed that lifespan and stature were linked so that the taller a man was, the shorter his lifespan was as well:The research showed, for the first time, that the \"longevity gene\" FOXO3 is linked to human body size. \"We knew that in animal models of aging. We did not know that in humans,\" Dr. Willcox said in a statement. \"We have the same or a slightly different version [of the gene] in mice, roundworms, flies, even yeast ... it\u2019s important in longevity across all these species.\"\"The small yeast, flies and mice have genes like FOXO3 that dampen insulin signaling and make them smaller from birth,\" said Dr. Willcox of the image above.In order to make that same connection with their human subjects, Dr. Willcox and his team compared the genotypes of men that lived to be 95 years and older with those in the study who lived an average lifespan.\"What we found was that those who lived a long time versus those who lived an average time tended to have a certain version of the FOXO3 gene,\" Dr. Willcox told HuffPost. They discovered that people with the \"protective\" version of the gene had double the odds of living to 100 -- triple, if the person inherited that gene from both parents.\"If you're bigger you have more cells, so you have to grow more and you use up a lot of those cells,\" researcher Dr. Tim Donlon theorized to Hawaii News Now. \"My feeling is that if you're shorter, you have a reserve of cells you can use later in life, and that might have some impact on why shorter people or smaller people have a longer life span.\"As Hawaii News Now points out, the longevity gene acts \"like a stress resistance gene. It sees problems and fixes them. For example, if there are too many cancer cells around, it will eradicate them. Everyone has it, but only 4 percent of people have the protective version.\"\"One of the reasons why Honolulu is perfect for this kind of study is that we have the longest-lived state in the country, combined with a population that has remained, for the most part, in Hawaii,\" Dr. Willcox said in a statement. He also noted that \"no matter how tall you are you can still live a healthy lifestyle\" to make up for not having the protective FOXO3 gene.While the study could potentially apply to women and other ethnicities, researchers say that more research is needed to verify whether the results can be generalized beyond Japanese-American men. But Dr. Willcox seems confident that it will.\"People aren't all that different. Genetically, we're all pretty similar,\" he told HuffPost. \"If this effect applies to model organisms, than you can be pretty sure that it applies to other humans because humans are a lot more similar to each other than they are to model organisms.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [527], "text": ["longevity"]}, "id": "467445922004484096"}, {"question": "The one tool I didn't expect to find on the back of the Marine Corps' main battle tank", "context": "ANNISTON ARMY DEPOT, Alabama \u2014 Used in nearly every major US conflict since its introduction in 1980, America's mighty M1 Abrams serves as the principal battle tank of the Army and Marine Corps.At close to 70 tons, the stalwart M1A1 Abrams is among the heaviest tanks in the world, but it makes up for its weight with exceptional firepower and unnerving maneuverability.Today the Abrams has three variants \u2014 the M1, the M1A1, and the M1A2 \u2014 thanks to upgrades and modifications carried out at Anniston Army Depot, a maintenance and munitions-storage site nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.On a recent tour of the 3.5 million square feet of said installation, where war-weary tanks are resurrected, I was tipped off to inquire about a \"grunt phone.\"Motioning for me to walk to the back of a turret-less Marine Corps M1A1, a logistics specialist at the installation named Larry Phillips pointed to what he called a \"TIP,\" or tank infantry phone \u2014 aka grunt phone.Secured to the rear of the hull underneath the taillight guard and above the track, the exterior phone housed in a box allows infantry troops to communicate with the tank crew.The infantry phone, a frequent request from troops serving in Iraq, was incorporated in the 2006 rollout of the Tank Urban Survival Kit system, a series of Abrams modifications intended to improve coordination and survivability in urban environments.Along with the grunt phone, TUSK added a remote weapon station machine gun operated from inside the vehicle, a loader's armor gun shield, reactive armor tiles fitted to side skirts, a remote thermal sight, and a power-distribution box.Because of upgrades and improvements such as TUSK, a new Abrams tank has not been built from scratch since 1993.", "answers": {"answer_start": [948], "text": ["infantry phone"]}, "id": "4n2kke"}, {"question": "The U.S. city that doesn't have enough homes:", "context": "\"We have seen an extremely competitive market even in the winter months.

Instead of clicking, he forwarded the message to researchers at the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab.The hack is the first known case of software that can remotely take over a fully up-to-date iPhone 6.Experts at Citizen Lab worked with security company Lookout and determined that the link would have installed a program taking advantage of a three flaws that Apple and others were not aware of.

Tools such as that used in this case, a remote exploit for a current iPhone, cost as much as $1 million.NSO chief executive Shalev Hulio referred questions to spokesman Zamir Dahbash, who said the company \"cannot confirm the specific cases\" covered in the Citizen Lab and Lookout reports.Dahbash said NSO sells within export laws to government agencies, which then operate the software.\"The agreements signed with the company\u2019s customers require that the company\u2019s products only be used in a lawful manner,\" he added. \"Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes.\"Dahbash did not answer follow-up questions, including whether the exposure of the tools use against Mansoor in UAE and a Mexican journalist would end any sales to those countries.Low ProfileNSO has kept a low profile in the security world, despite its 2014 sale of a majority stake for $120 million to California private equity firm Francisco Partners.

In November 2015, Reuters reported that NSO had begun calling itself \"Q\" and was looking for a buyer for close to $1 billion.Sarah McKune, senior legal adviser to Citizen Lab, said Israel tries to follow the strictures of the Wassenaar Arrangement, which puts controls on the international sale of nuclear and chemical weapons technology and more recently cyber intrusion tools.NSO may have had to apply for an export license, she added, saying that raised questions about \"what consideration was given to the human rights record of UAE.\"The Israeli embassy in Washington did not respond to an email seeking comment.NSO marketing material says that it also has capabilities for Android and BlackBerry devices. No version of the software has been exposed, indicating it remains effective.Citizen Lab did not directly accuse UAE of carrying out the attack on Mansoor with NSO gear called Pegasus, but it said other NSO attacks on critics of the regime were connected to the government.Others TargetedIt also said a Mexican journalist and a minority party politician in Kenya had been targeted with NSO software and that domain names set up for other attacks referred to entities in Uzbekistan, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and other nations, suggesting that other targets lived in those nations.A call to the UAE embassy in Washington was not immediately returned.The market for \"lawful intercept,\" or government hacking tools, has come under increased scrutiny with revelations about authoritarian customers and noncriminal victims.Two popular vendors, Hacking Team of Italy and Gamma Group of the United Kingdom, have had their wares exposed by researchers or hackers.Mansoor had previously been targeted with software from both of those companies, according to Citizen Lab.\"I can\u2019t think of a more compelling case of serial misuse of lawful intercept malware than the targeting of Mansoor,\" said one of the Citizen Lab researchers, John Scott-Railton.", "answers": {"answer_start": [134], "text": ["fix a dangerous security flaw"]}, "id": "4zoblf"}, {"question": "Here's a video of a porcupine predicting the Super Bowl winner", "context": "Looks like Teddy Bear the porcupine is looking to take over where Eli the orangutan left off.Teddy Bear, the latest in a line of animal Super Bowl forecasters, is predicting that the Seattle Seahawks will defeat the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl on Sunday.Before you place those bets, keep in mind the porcupine prognosticates this by picking corn out of either a dispenser representing the Seahawks or the Patriots.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and her longtime aide Dan Geldon made the rounds in the House of Representatives throughout 2009, looking to persuade as many Financial Services Committee members as they could to sign off on her idea for an agency dedicated to protecting consumers from financial predation.Warren recounts one such meeting with an unnamed House Democrat in her new book, A Fighting Chance.I remember one meeting particularly well. A congresswoman who seemed really interested in what we had to say told me that she supported consumers and wanted to see them treated fairly. Then she raised a specific objection to the agency. I answered, but instead of talking about the issue, she moved on to another objection, and so on through a list of about half a dozen more problems. Despite her many objections, I felt a little encouraged. Once Dan and I were out in the hall, I said, \"Well, she didn't agree with much of anything, but at least she was talking. Maybe we have a shot at persuading her.\" For a moment, Dan looked like he was weighing whether to give me the bad news. But Dan never holds back long on bad news. He explained that the congresswoman had just run through every talking point included in a press release issued by the American Bankers Association that morning. In order. Oh.A source close to Warren, familiar with the meeting, tells The Huffington Post that the congresswoman in question was then-Rep. Melissa Bean of Illinois.On Friday, Politico's Morning Money newsletter announced that Bean has been named to a high-profile job with JPMorgan Chase, where she'll serve as chair of Midwest operations -- a job previously held by Bill Daley, who vacated it to become briefly the chief of staff to President Barack Obama.Bean lost her 2010 reelection race to tea party favorite Joe Walsh, who subsequently was knocked from office by Democrat Tammy Duckworth after he suggested in a debate that there need be no exception to abortion bans in cases of rape and incest because of advances in medical science.During her tenure in Congress, Bean developed a reputation for privileging Wall Street over consumers and taxpayers. HuffPost's Arthur Delaney profiled her in a 2010 story titled \"Melissa Bean: A Democrat Bankers Bank On.\"Morning Money -- which HuffPost has also profiled -- reported around the time of Bean's election loss that she was being considered to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the same agency that Warren had been pushing in 2009. The idea was resoundingly panned by bank reformers.Bean declined an interview for this article. But former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who served as chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, told HuffPost that it's unfair to paint her as a bank sellout.\"Optics, shmoptics,\" Frank said. \"The only issue where we differed [on the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation] was over the degree of preemption for the national banks. ... She didn't want to go as far as I wanted to go.\"Despite strenuous objections from consumer advocates, Bean had wanted to block states from enacting tougher laws against predatory lending than the federal government adopted. She ultimately voted for Dodd-Frank after threatening to blow the whole thing up over the issue of federal preemption.At times during their congressional tenures, of course, both Frank and Bean agreed with Wall Street. Both voted against auditing the Federal Reserve, for instance. Frank noted that Bean also favored keeping low tax rates for hedge fund managers and private-equity kingpins, which he opposed.But he defended her decision to take a job at the nation's largest bank.\"Melissa was very supportive of financial reform in general as a member of the committee. ... Do we only want people who are opposed to regulation working at these institutions?\" Frank said. \"I hope it's a sign that [JPMorgan CEO Jamie] Dimon understands that this law is a reality, that it's important to accept the framework.\"A former top aide to Bean, who wasn't present at the 2009 meeting with Warren, said that while the congresswoman \"was certainly pro-business, she would never just repeat a lobbyist's talking points.\"Bean may not have had to get the bank industry's talking points from a lobbyist, however. In June 2009, she met with the man who held the job to which she's now been named, discussing Wall Street reform with Daley and other senior JPMorgan officials. The bank's executives donated $11,000 to her reelection campaign that same month, according to the Public Accountability Initiative's LittleSis website.The meeting with Warren happened on July 10, the source close to the senator said.Just weeks earlier, the JPMorgan officials had made their case to Bean. \"She laid out how she saw the president's proposal, and the difficulties politically in Congress, and Jamie [Dimon] and other members [of the board of directors] expressed their opinion of what they would like to see,\" Daley told the Chicago Tribune in 2009. But Daley added that Bean was not marching in lockstep against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\"It was clear in June that she did not have a knee-jerk aversion to the concept of a federal consumer protection agency, in spite of all our brilliant arguments,\" he said.Next time around, it'll be Bean getting to make the brilliant arguments.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1457], "text": ["Melissa Bean of Illinois"]}, "id": "480169390194036736"}, {"question": "What's the best chain sandwich shop in America?

They offer a solid selection of creative paninis, including chicken with spinach, basil, roasted tomatoes, and provolone cheese, signature sandwiches like roast beef, arugula, and goat cheese on potato thyme bread, and \"Mom\u2019s Sandwiches\" like smoked ham on white bread for the traditionalists. There are also breakfast scramblers, salads, soups, and fresh-baked pastries.12) Jason\u2019s DeliThe popular Texas-based Jason\u2019s Deli has more than 240 locations in 28 states, and business is booming. So what\u2019s the secret? A wide variety of both pre-designed and build-your-own offerings (including a killer muffaletta),a solid salad bar, and a commitment to change with the times: they\u2019ve eliminated trans fats and high-fructose corn syrup from their menus, offer \"lighter portion\" options, and have rolled out gluten-free offerings as well.11) Firehouse SubsFirehouse Subs doesn\u2019t just get its name from the hot sandwiches it sellsit was actually founded by two firefighters, brothers Robin and Chris Sorensen, in Jacksonville, Fla. in 1994. Today there are more than 600 locations across the country, and they all have firehouse-inspired touches (as well as Coke Freestyle dispensers, the first major chain to have them). Subs also have firehouse-inspired names, like the Hook & Ladder (turkey, ham, and melted Monterrey Jack)other specialty subs include the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket, with beef brisket that\u2019s been smoked for more than 16 hours topped with Cheddar and sauce. Their meatball sub is also killer.10) Au Bon PainOne of the classics, Au Bon Pain was the first sandwich chain to take the gourmet route. Founded in Boston in 1978, the chain is known for its coffee, soups, pastries, and, of course, sandwiches. Sandwiches come both hot and cold, in varieties like Black Angus roast beef and herb cheese, chicken salad on country white with cranberries and almonds, and Chicken Pomodoro on ciabatta. The layout and atmosphere tends to be a bit more chilled-out than other chain sandwich shops, and you\u2019d really still be hard-pressed to leave an Au Bon Pain unsatisfied.9) Einstein Bros.Spun off of Boston Market in 1995 as a way to sell breakfast items (evem though they're no longer owned by them), Einstein Bros. has officially taken on a life of its own with more than 820 locations in 40 states. The menu is of course heavy on bagels, fresh-baked in more than 20 varieties including chocolate chip, pretzel, and six-cheese, which can be used as part of a breakfast sandwich or a filling lunch. Sandwiches include bacon, avocado, and turkey, chicken salad, and mixed veggies, as well as lighter options like asparagus, mushroom, and Swiss cheese on a \"bagel thin single.\" Remind me why we\u2019re not eating all of our sandwiches on bagels?8) Potbelly Sandwich WorksFounded in Chicago in 1977, Potbelly\u2019s popularity (and footprint) has rocketed in recent years. Sandwiches are toasted and served hot on regular or multigrain rolls, and come with classic fillings like meatballs, smoked ham, roast beef, chicken salad, and grilled chicken and Cheddar. There\u2019s a choice of toppings, or you can ask for a \"Skinny,\" with less meat and cheese on thin-cut bread. But if you\u2019re a first-timer, go for A Wreck: salami, roast beef, turkey, ham, and Swiss. Grab a milkshake to wash it down, snag a table near the frequent live music, and you\u2019ll be all set. They\u2019re also one of the few publicly traded companies on this rankingthey were listed on NASDAQ in October 2013.7) Cos\u00ecThe original Cos\u00ec was actually inspired by a caf\u00e9 in Paris, and they\u2019re perhaps best known for their low-key caf\u00e9 vibe, bread baked in view of customers, and s\u2019mores for dessert. Sandwiches are served on a freshly baked white or multigrain flatbread, in creative varieties like BBQ pulled pork and Cheddar melt, Buffalo Bleu, and Tandoori Chicken. Salads are also stellar here, made fresh to order with homemade dressings, and that flatbread is pretty versatile, also being used in pizzas.6) Jersey Mike\u2019s SubsIn business since 1956, Jersey Mike\u2019s has been around longer than any other chain on our list, and is a true American success story. In 1975 the original Point Pleasant, N.J., shop went up for sale, and a 17-year-old employee named Peter Cancro scraped together enough money to buy it. Today there are more than 750 locations nationwide and Cancro is CEO of the company. So what\u2019s the secret? Quality. Meats and cheeses at Jersey Mike\u2019s are sliced to order, Angus top rounds are trimmed and cooked on-premises, and bread is baked fresh in-house daily. They\u2019re also committed to giving to charity, generally setting aside one day per month when all proceeds are donated.5) Schlotzsky\u2019sTo go from a small shop in Austin to an international franchise with locations in 35 states and five countries in 40 years takes commitment and a little luck, and for Schlotzsky\u2019s that lucky break came in the form of an invention that blew away those who tried it in the early days: smoked ham, Genoa and cotto salamis, melted Cheddar, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses, black olives, red onion, lettuce, tomato, mustard, and dressing on a toasted sourdough bun, also known as The Original. More than 25 additional varieties of sandwiches have joined it on the menu since then, including Angus beef and provolone, chicken and pesto, and a turkey bacon club, along with pizzas, salads, and soups, but it\u2019s still that Original that\u2019s one of the finest sandwiches you\u2019re bound to find anywhere.4) Quiznos SubsQuiznos was the first major chain to really play up the \"toasted\" factor, and even though it might seem like a no-brainer these days, that\u2019s only because everyone else has jumped on the bandwagon. The second-largest sub chain in America behind Subway, with more than 4,000 U.S. locations and hundreds more around the world, it started with a single shop in Denver and a pizza oven from a local Tombstone. Today, they offer sandwiches with steak, chicken, turkey, and deli meats, in varieties like Pesto Caesar, Baja, Mesquite, Carbonara (with Alfredo sauce), and The Traditional, with turkey, ham, roast beef, Cheddar, olives, lettuce, tomato, onions, and ranch. Breads include white, wheat, rosemary Parmesan, jalape\u00f1o Cheddar, or flatbread, and they\u2019ll also not toast it for you if you ask nicely.3) Jimmy John\u2019s Gourmet SandwichesWith about 200 units opening every year for the past few years, Jimmy John\u2019s, founded in an Illinois garage in 1983 by Jimmy John Liautaud, is on a path to world domination, and that\u2019s fine by us. Bread is baked in-house daily and served fresh, and ingredients are as high-quality as possible: \"The turkey is real turkey, the roast beef is real roast beef \u2014 no additives, no vegetable-based fillers, no fake stuff,\" the website claims. Sandwiches are composed with an eye toward balance, but if you want to go big, go for the J.J. Gargantuan: Genoa salami, ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey, provolone, onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and homemade Italian dressing on a French bun. Now that\u2019s a sandwich.2) SubwaySubway may very well be the reigning king of fast-food style sandwich chains, with 40,445 locations in 103 countries as of October 2013, but that wasn\u2019t enough to make it to number on our list. Most people smell Subway before they see it, a result of the bread baking, and its backlit sign and fluorescent lighting is instantly recognizable the world over. Founded by two friends in Bridgeport, Conn., in 1965, the chain exploded out of the gate and today has more locations than even McDonald\u2019s. They change with the times (rolling out flatbreads, breakfast, chopped salads, and even personal pizzas), but at its core it\u2019s all about the subs, made with expert precision. Like all fast-food brands, there\u2019s something almost comforting about the familiar sight of a Subway: you know exactly what you\u2019re going to get, and it\u2019ll taste just like it always has.1) Panera BreadWith 46 percent of respondents voting for Panera Bread as one of their favorites, the fast-casual chain was the runaway winner, with more than 150 more votes than number two on our list. Panera, originally called the St. Louis Bread Company, was a spin-off of Au Bon Pain, but was such a success that Au Bon Pain sold itself out and renamed itself Panera Bread. There are more than 1,700 \"Bakery-Cafes\" in 44 states, and 20 facilities delivering fresh dough to each location daily so it can be baked on-premises. The first chain to voluntarily post calorie counts on its menus and one of the nation\u2019s largest providers of free Wi-Fi, Panera has consistently been ahead of the curve when it comes to dining trends. They offer comfortable seating, a wide menu that\u2019s constantly being updated with seasonal specials, and breakfast items, salads, pasta, soups, and pastries as well as expertly prepared sandwiches that can be customized to order.

Both Rey and Palpatine are the only two characters in the Star Wars universe who use this forward-thrust move.This mirroring is equally powerful when you realise the first move we see each of them perform is this forward thrust.Rey\u2019s first lightsaber battle has several other visual references to Palpatine\u2019s fighting style, almost too many to be coincidental.This cyclical referencing also works in the sense that the earlier films have followed a pattern of Skywalker vs Palpatine tension. In The Force Awakens, if Rey\u2019s parentage does stem from Palpatine, her battle against Kylo Ren continues the Skywalker/Palpatine tension, flipping the dark and light sides. For now.That\u2019s because Rey is already struggling with the pull of the dark side. While every fledgling Jedi struggles between the pull of light and dark, there are moments during The Force Awakens that point to Rey being tempted to the dark.In the film\u2019s script, it describes Rey as \"standing on the edge of the dark side\".During Rey\u2019s vision, Palpatine can be heard several times.Right before the hallway collapses on her, you can hear Palpatine\u2019s scream, and further along, there\u2019s audio of Palpatine saying \"any Jedi\". There are a few other audio snippets included (Luke, Obi-Wan, and Yoda to name a few) but Palpatine\u2019s inclusion seems like an outlier when you consider Luke\u2019s lightsaber is the trigger for the vision. Why else would ol\u2019 Palps show up, if not because of some kind of relationship to Rey?The notion of hiding in plain sight comes into play when you consider the poster for The Force Awakens.In the portrait form, Rey\u2019s strategic placement puts her between the dark and light sides in the most literal sense.But when expanded out, Rey is placed toward the dark side, hanging with Kylo Ren, her staff aligned with his lightsaber to almost seem as if they\u2019re one.Finally, what about the accent? A lot of people used Rey\u2019s British accent as evidence that she could be a Kenobi, but guess who else had a fancy posh accent. Yep.

President-elect Donald Trump has claimed the opposite, suggesting it gives the United States \"a lot of power\" over China.Experts say the reality is more complicated, arguing that the debt relationship binds the world's two largest economies closely together. Trump has suggested he will take a more confrontational stance toward China on trade, threatening to slap tariffs of as much as 45% on Chinese goods.For years, China spent trillions of yuan buying Treasuries as a way of stopping its currency from getting too strong even as its economy grew rapidly. That made China's exports more competitive, but it also helped to keep interest rates in the U.S. lower than they would have been.But as China's economy has slowed in recent years, huge sums of money have been flowing out of the country, putting downward pressure on the yuan. The surge in the dollar since Trump's election victory has piled on the pressure.Beijing has been selling some of its enormous stockpile of foreign exchange reserves, much of it U.S. government debt, in order to buy yuan. It wants to avoid a repeat of the sudden plunges in the currency that panicked markets in August 2015 and January 2016.China's foreign currency war chest fell to its lowest level in more than five years in November.", "answers": {"answer_start": [100], "text": ["Japan"]}, "id": "588718973002375168"}, {"question": "Good Samaritan leaves sweet surprise in box of Walmart cookies", "context": "An unemployed Oregon man got an extra sweet surprise after purchasing a box of cookies from Walmart last weekend.Phil, whose last name has not been reported, told KPTV that he discovered a $100 bill in the package of snickerdoodles he brought home on Saturday.Upon returning to the store, he found another $100 bill in one of the three remaining boxes of cookies.

I've worn glasses most of my life and as I get older that's a situation that I've only expected to get worse. When the Trust Me, I'm A Doctor team suggested that I try taking supplements to improve my eyesight, though, I was sceptical, particularly as I am not a fan of supplements.Nonetheless I headed off to meet Prof John Barbur of City University in London to have my eyesight thoroughly tested. He was particularly interested in my retina, the light sensitive part of the eye, and made me stare at a computer screen in the dark for hours, having tests flashed up at me which thoroughly and precisely measured the limitations of my perception of different colours, my night vision and my detection of faint and small objects.He also measured the level of protection that the most delicate area of my retina - the macula - had against damage from high energy blue and UV light. This protection is, in effect, a kind of natural sunscreen that we have covering the light-detecting cells, and is made up of yellowish \"macular pigments\".The results of my tests were both fascinating and depressing. My detection of yellow and blue colours was extremely poor - something that Prof Barbur said was likely the result of my brush with diabetes many years ago. My night vision and perception of details were also poor compared with younger people - but consistent with my age.The Trust Me team then handed me a 90-day supply of supplement pills that were supposed to help. They contained concentrations of certain compounds found in coloured plants. These were extracted from marigolds, but two of the key chemicals - lutein and zeaxanthin - are also found in a range of things we eat more commonly.Find out moreMichael Mosley (left, above) presents Trust Me, I'm A Doctor which is on Thursday 8 September on BBC Two at 20:00 BST - catch up on BBC iPlayerA team in the United States devised a recipe for a daily smoothie for us that they hoped could supply a similar level of lutein and zeaxanthin. It was a heady mix of fruits and veg such as kale and kiwi fruit, along with fats such as milk and wheat germ oil which help the absorption of the key compounds.Twelve weeks later, I returned to City University to see whether my daily pill-popping had made any difference to my eyesight. The results surprised even Prof Barbur. There were significant improvements in several different aspects - my blue and yellow colour perception was back to normal and my night vision was much better. The levels of my protective macular pigments were also boosted.The results were less of a surprise to Prof John Nolan, who I went to meet in Waterford, in south-east Ireland. His team has been studying macular pigments for many years, and recently completed a year-long trial with over 100 participants in which they had seen similar results to mine.They found that boosting the diet with the three macular pigments - lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin - led to significant improvements in the protection of the delicate macula, as well as improved eyesight.There is also some evidence that such supplementation may help slow or possibly even prevent, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - the leading cause of vision loss in the UK. However, this is still controversial.Should we all, then, be taking supplements to protect and even improve our eyesight?Image copyright Reuters Image caption It's a good idea to eat kaleWell, the research certainly shows that supplements work. Even for someone like me, who has a relatively healthy diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables, and whose blood levels of the compounds that weren't particularly low, the supplements helped. However, some researchers believe that diet can simply be enough, if we eat the right things.More research needs to be done on the best dietary sources for each of the three macular pigments.Lutein is a yellow compound made only by plants. They make it in order to absorb blue light, as part of their mechanism to capture energy from sunlight through photosynthesis. Animals then get it from eating plants - good sources are green kale and spinach, or the yellow yolks of eggs.It is used as a supplement to feed industrially-reared chickens to make their yolks a more attractive yellow (and, being fat-soluble, ends up turning their skin and fat yellow too).Zeaxanthin is another yellow compound, almost identical to lutein, made by plants to absorb light. It is the chemical that gives corn, bell peppers and saffron their yellow colour.Meso-zeaxanthin is a form of zeaxanthin not generally found in plants, but it is made in the body from lutein. More research needs to be done on how efficient this process is. It is found in some fish (particularly in the skins), but in supplements containing marigold extract, it appears that the industrial processing that the marigolds undergo can create meso-zeaxanthin (and it has been found to be in some marigold-extract supplements, even when not listed on the label).Our volunteers taking the smoothie containing amounts of plant sources calculated to give them a boost of lutein and zeaxanthin did indeed boost their lutein levels, but not their zeaxanthin. Clearly more work needs to be done to refine the recipe. So, this might be a rare occasion where, given the current state of research, I might end up on the side of supplements - especially for those who don't eat as many leafy greens as they should, and for older people (who absorb nutrients less efficiently).However, for all of those whose mothers and grandmothers told them that carrots would improve their vision the message is this - although lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin are all chemicals known as \"carotenoids\", and carrots do owe the yellow portion of their colour to them, these particular key compounds are found mainly in the green parts of plants above ground.So, if you want to improve your eyesight, I'm afraid it's munching on leafy greens (taken with some fats to help absorb these fat-soluble chemicals) that will do the best job.Michael Mosley presents Trust Me, I'm A Doctor which is on Thursday 8 September on BBC Two at 20:00 BST", "answers": {"answer_start": [5546], "text": ["leafy greens"]}, "id": "51dxjh"}, {"question": "This Easy iPhone Trick Will Save You Tons of Photo Space", "context": "We\u2019ve all been there: Running low on iPhone storage space, scrambling to delete photos we can live without to record new memories.

The pot was unearthed on the Menominee Reservation in Wisconsin, where it had laid buried for the past 800 years.Inside, archaeologists found a stash of seeds. The seeds were probably buried in the pot as a method of storing food supplies.

I've asked myself a lot, \"How much money would I have to save to do thatright now?\" The answer is actually kind of boring, either \"a million-ish dollars (assuming you're debt-free and and don't mind living somewhere weird),\" or \"significantly less than a million-ish dollars (assuming you're debt-free, really good at investing, and don't mind living like a monk).\"A number of internet personalities preach the virtues of a frugality-first lifestyle meant to help you save and invest to a point where you can live off your meager budget forever; philosophically, they fall somewhere between the Four-Hour Workweek guy and those who think you can \"opt out\" of paying your taxes because they're secretly voluntary.There's the Early Retirement Extreme guy that claims to live off $5,000-$7,000 per year and espouses vaguely anarcho-capitalist ideals; there's Mr. Money Mustache, whose New Yorker profile portrayed him as a goofy, stoner-ish version of the Early Retirement Extreme guy. There's the Retire By 40 guy and a couple who call themselves Millennial Revolution and implore you to \"Stop working. Start living.\"These people make achieving early retirement seem like more work than, well, work itself\u2014not to mention that the idea of retired young-ish people making a living selling others on the dream of early retirement seems like a pyramid scheme. \"Those [people] are outliers,\" says Mike Dang, a co-founding editor of the financial site The Billfold who also serves as the Editor-In-Chief of Longreads. \"It's not a story you can learn from. They're nice to read, and then you move on with your day because you have a whole different set of problems than what those people have.\"The first of those problems is that saving is generally a complicated business, especially if you came of age during the Great Recession, says Dang: \"Wages were stagnant, but the amount of debt we were accruing after college was skyrocketing.\" Housing costs, healthcare, and student loans have risen since, so many young people are financially stretched as it is: \"There are all these expenses you need to think about, then your savings, then retirement.\"Let's say you could clear all your outstanding debts, cut down on housing costs through living at your parents' house, and taking a second job freelancing part-time (or selling weed). In that case you could stop working once you had around a million dollars.As certified financial planner Sofia Bera explains to me, \"People who have a ton of money don't need to invest for growth\u2014they just need a big enough sum to generate enough income on a yearly basis,\" through payouts on investments. For retirees of any age, the idea is to have enough of a nest egg built up to the point that you can expect to draw a \"salary\" from your investments while still adding enough to weather inflation rates. \"That can work out really well if you only need two or three percent a year in dividends in order to withdraw from your portfolio,\" Bera says.Once you hit that million-dollar figure, you're able to turn your money into a perpetual money-making machine that you can theoretically live off of\u2014that is, if you make some life adjustments. Judging off the yields Bera suggests, you'd be able to take $20,000 to $30,000 per year from your fund\u2014enough to live sustainably in any of the lowest-income places in the United States.Regardless, you really should start saving some money for retirement. Even a small amount can make a big difference over a number of years. (Here's a primer to get you started.) As for how much you'll need: Dang says that when people ask him this question, \"I always tell them to think about how they want to live their lives.\" Some might decide to work well into advanced age as a way to keep themselves occupied while providing themselves with a bit of income; others might want to spend their twilight years having fun or using their decades of sexual experience to do weird sex stuff (and potentially get a couple STI's).The point is, even if the world suffers some sort of cataclysmic event that turns society into The Road Warrior, you'll still need some savings to get by\u2014if only to buy up all the weapons and gasoline you'll need to become a post-apocalyptic pirate ruler.

This is especially true for matters related to retirement, since your golden years are fast approaching.To be financially ready to retire by 67, retirement-plan provider Fidelity Investments says you should aim to have six times your salary saved by age 50 .Are Americans on track?According to a report from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), the mean retirement savings of a family between 44 and 49 years old is $81,347:But that number doesn't tell the whole story. Since so many families have zero savings and since super-savers can pull up the average, the median savings, or those at the 50th percentile, may be a better gauge. The median for families between 44 and 49 is only $6,200.To get closer to Fidelity's recommendation of having six times your salary saved by 50, follow these four steps so your money can grow over time:1. Contribute as much of your income as possible. Most experts recommend setting aside 10% or more in a tax-advantaged retirement savings account, such as a 401(k) plan .2. Automate your contributions. Have your employer do a payroll deduction or have your money taken out of your checking account and sent straight to your retirement account. You'll never see the money and will learn to live without it.3. Get in the habit of upping your savings consistently, either every six months, at the end of each year or whenever you get a raise. Again, if you make this automatic by setting up \"auto-increase,\" you won't forget to up your contributions (or talk yourself out of setting aside a larger chunk).4. Invest in something other than your retirement-savings plan. Enrolling in your employer's 401(k) plan is a good start, but experts say that it may not provide enough to fund your future.

In fact, scientists at Cambridge University in the UK have found that cutting back on serving size alone can help Americans eat an average of 527 fewer calories per day, resulting in a weight loss of about one pound per week. Researchers crunched the numbers on more than 60 studies on food intake and found that increasing portion sizes have caused us all to eat more, regardless of our gender, hunger levels, how thin or fat we are, or our amount of self-reported willpower. In particular, they found that supersized portions can add more than 500 calories to each of our plates every day, which has only helped to make us fatter and fatter. \"The message is that, however it happens, reducing the amounts of food that end up in front of us in the first place is key [to weight loss],\" says Gareth Hollands, PhD, senior research associate at Cambridge University School of Clinical Medicine and coauthor of the paper.But there's one big problem: The first and only step of portion control\u2014eat less\u2014is notoriously difficult to do.

Forget about portions when you eat out, because restaurants are notorious for serving oversize meals. Resolve before you even walk into a restaurant to split an entr\u00e9e, supplementing with a salad or veggie side dish. Avoid all-you-can-eat deals, and wait to have your cocktail until after your meal, since alcohol is proven to trigger overeating.2. Downsize your plates and glasses to smaller tableware, which will go a long way in reducing how much food ends up on your plate. 3. Most of us are serving ourselves too much food without even realizing it. Learn what an appropriate portion size looks like by using this handy visual guide. 4. Fill half your plate with low-calorie, fiber-rich fruits and veggies that aren't dripping in butter or cream sauce (herbs and spices are your friends!), using one-quarter of your plate for a lean protein and the final quarter for a whole grain like brown rice.

This Classic Pokemon Gets A New Name!", "context": "Well, I guess it was good while it lasted, but apparently all things must come to an end; or quite possibly just a revamped beginning. Pokemon has been around for what seems like forever, well actually 20 years now. For some of you readers, Pokemon may have been around since before you were born, which makes me feel even older considering I played link-battles on the school bus with my friends.With Nintendo's upcoming release of two new Pokemon titles, Pokemon Sun and Moon, I don't think they ever thought that their beloved games would wind up getting so complicated. But when you starting renaming one of the most famous characters in the franchise, it's easy to see why things are getting so complicated. With Nintendo's attempt to unify game releases in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan the games are going to be released in both traditional and simplified Chinese. This may not seem like a big deal, but until now differences in culture and dialect have spawned a variety of translations. This is going to change with Sun and Moon and as reported by Zheping Huang in Quartz, this is what we'll see:Now Nintendo wants to unify them: Poke\u0301mon in Greater China will be officially called \u7cbe\u9748\u5bf6\u53ef\u5922, or Jingling Baokemeng in Mandarin (Jingling means \"spirit\" or \"elf,\" and Baokemeng is a transliteration of Poke\u0301mon). Earlier in Hong Kong, it was \u5bf5\u7269\u5c0f\u7cbe\u9748 Pet Little Elves (or Spirits), while in Taiwan, it was \u795e\u5947\u5bf6\u8c9d, Magic Babies.This probably makes sense if you live in any area with a singular dialect, but when you're trying to make one unified language version of a game to an area that has several unique dialects there are bound to be some twists.Hong Kong is where one of these twists can be found - Hong Kong being where the common language has always been Cantonese, rather than Mandarin. Because Pokemon Sun and Moon will be translated into Mandarin now, it's causing a stir because Pikachu now has a new name!That's Right, I said it, Pikachu is now PikaqiuPikachu was originally translated as \u6bd4\u5361\u8d85 (Bei-kaa-chyu) in Hong Kong. Now it is named \u76ae\u5361\u4e18 (Pikaqiu). While the name \u76ae\u5361\u4e18 in Mandarin sounds similar to the global name Pikachu (as it was always called in China and Taiwan), it reads as Pei-kaa-jau in Cantonese, which doesn\u2019t sound the same at all.Fans of the bright electric mouse have been protesting NIntendo's translating choice saying that they will never buy from Nintendo again. Although the protest has gained over 6,000 signatures for a petition against the decision, it looks as though Nintendo is sticking with the new translation.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1962], "text": ["Pikaqiu"]}, "id": "4m0r7b"}, {"question": "Meet the unlikely iron lady in Washington's budget battle", "context": "WASHINGTON -- When your opponents' legislative style bears frequent comparison to the antics of angry toddlers, perhaps what's needed is a lead negotiator with a schoolteacher mentality and a knack for discipline.Democrats think they may have that in Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who so famously sticks to the script that reporters are tempted to call her boring.She happens to have started her career wrangling obstreperous children -- which turns out to have been excellent preparation for the details-oriented approach that Murray has adopted in politics and that she intends to bring to the high-stakes budget negotiations that began last week with Republicans and continue Wednesday.\"I taught preschool,\" Murray told The Huffington Post in an interview in her Capitol Hill office this week. \"You don't walk into a class with 4-year-olds without a direction of where you're going to go.\"Murray most certainly has a plan for the budget conference with House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). It boils down to offering various compromises and seeing if Republicans are willing to bite after their disastrous, poll-punished bid to defund Obamacare by shutting down the government.\"I look at this as the Republican opportunity to stand up and show there can be adults in their party and help our country find compromise and move us forward as a country,\" Murray said. \"If they opt not to do that, and this budget conference ends up in the same place with no resolution, I think it's going to hurt them in the long run. I think there are more of them that see that, and I'm hopeful they stand up.\"The conference committee aims to find ways to replace the sequestration budget cuts that Congress' last failed negotiations left, and to hash out ways to fund the government after the current stopgap bill expires Jan. 15 and to raise the debt ceiling after Feb. 7.To get there, Murray is offering a menu of items that Democrats don't like, but have been willing to swallow, if Ryan and company will compromise. Among the proposals are some $350 billion in entitlement cuts spelled out in the budget the Senate passed in March. Her iron rule is that Republicans get nothing if they are not willing to give something in the way of raising revenue. And replacing the sequester cannot mean simply boosting defense and cutting domestic programs.\"First of all, it's going to be defense and non-defense. There's going to be revenue that is part of the package, and then if there's revenue, that will kind of outline what we're willing to give in terms of spending cuts,\" Murray said.\"We're not going to cut Medicare and impact benefits for seniors to replace defense cuts,\" she added. \"I don't think the country would back that. We are going to look and are willing to look at a series of things that we can do on the cutting side.\" She said cuts wouldn't include yoking Social Security payments to so-called chained CPI -- changing the way inflation is measured so that benefits grow more slowly than under the current inflation index.Ryan offered no concessions when he sat down next to Murray for the first conference committee meeting, saying Democrats had better forget about trying to raise revenue as part of the solution to America's debt problems. \"I want to say this from the get-go: If this conference becomes an argument about taxes, we\u2019re not going to get anywhere,\" said Ryan.He exuded a certain type of charm and confidence as he opened the talks, appearing unchastened by the government shutdown debacle.\"You\u2019ll notice there are three senators for every congressman -- so as we see it, that's an even match,\" Ryan joked. \"I like to think quality beats quantity.\"Murray stuck to her script and made no jokes when it was her turn to speak. But the diminutive grandmother, somewhat dwarfed by the former vice presidential nominee, likely agreed with his quip -- at least the part about brains trumping bulk.And she thinks the smart thing for Republicans to do is, well, stop being babies.\"I think the Republicans have to sit back and say, 'Do we want to be part of that governing party system and compromise system, or do we want to be the group in the corner that yells and screams?' \" Murray said. \"That's what caused the government shutdown, the -- I'm sorry, I used to teach preschool -- the temper tantrum on the floor, to show how somehow they are powerful.\"The question of power is an interesting one for Murray. She cuts such an unassuming figure that it's easy to underestimate her. But she comes off a 2012 election cycle in which she shepherded the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to improbable wins. She's also the fourth-ranking member of the Senate leadership, making her arguably the most powerful elected woman in politics.And in the context of budget talks, she's almost a direct extension of Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Aides, who spoke anonymously because they did not have permission to talk about the personal relationship, said Murray has near-carte blanche from Reid because they are on the same page philosophically about the budget. \"When they talk about this stuff, they finish each other's sentences,\" one aide said.That authority was on display in the late days of the government shutdown, when Democrats showed signs of caving. A plan introduced by Republican Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) was gathering steam among red state Democrats and eventually won the backing of seven Democrats. The plan was built on the premise that for Republicans, it was a concession to reopen the government and raise the borrowing cap. It asked Democrats to accept a two-year delay of Obamacare's medical device tax, and to lock in sequester cuts for six months.Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) threw his support behind the plan, but on the Saturday before the shutdown ended -- a critical day of negotiations -- Murray shut it down.A Democratic leadership aide said that during a closed-door meeting, Murray beseeched her colleagues not to force the country into six more months of meat-ax sequester cuts. Such a move would also weaken her hand in upcoming budget negotiations, she argued. Democrats emerging from that meeting said her plea won the day.\"Patty Murray makes a very important point,\" Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said after the meeting. \"If she is bound going into a budget conference by the Paul Ryan number, where is her bargaining power? Some Senate Republicans were insisting on that. But that\u2019s unfair.\"Murray marched over to Collins on the Senate floor to deliver the answer herself.\"It was cordial. It wasn't heated, though it may have been animated,\" a leadership aide said.Collins declined to comment on the exchange but said she has a \"terrific relationship\" with Murray, whom she characterized as both a colleague and a friend.\"I have nothing but good things to say about her,\" Collins told HuffPost. \"She's strong, she works very hard, she's no-nonsense, down-to-earth and she knows how to bring people together and get the job done.\"And that's where she sees herself as she and Ryan head for their next meeting, Nov. 13, a month before their deadline to produce an agreement.\"The country has had enough of the temper tantrums and the non-compromise,\" Murray said, \"People believe strongly in things, and they expect us to come back here and fight for things, but they also get that a legislative democracy works by people coming together.\"Whatever the talk, few observers expect the conference committee to produce a deal. But with Murray as the calm, reasonable-seeming face of the Democratic position, the stakes may actually be higher for the GOP, whatever Ryan's smarmy opening joke may have suggested.\"I think there are a lot of people praying that we do our jobs, which is compromise,\" Murray said. \"If the Republicans choose not to and say no revenue, not a dime, nothing, I think that they will feel the backlash and I think many of them will realize that.\"And while she said she believes Republicans would again pay the price for another showdown, Murray insisted she'd prefer a deal.\"I'm a Democrat. I want Democrats to be in the majority, I want to us to be the party that sets the priorities -- I'm all for that,\" she said. \"But we also need a strong Republican Party of good people, who come here, who passionately care for things but are also willing to sit down and compromise.

Never did that list include breast cancer.Whitney was only 11 when I was diagnosed, a month before my 39th birthday. Her brother was 5 1\u20442. He was too young to understand what was happening at home then, too young to remember it now. But not my Whit. In fact, the irony didn't escape me that my little girl was in the process of developing her own breasts just as I was losing mine.Soon after my bilateral mastectomy, after my breasts were removed, but before the implants were inserted, Whit and I went shopping. We were in the fitting room and when she removed her clothes to try on a shirt, she turned away from me. She was already wearing a bra, but even still, it was clear she didn't want me looking at her. She hunched up her shoulders and drew her arms inward, protecting her modesty. I took this as an opportunity to joke with her a bit about the fact there was no need to be shy with me or embarrassed about her changing body. \"I've seen it all, remember? I'm the one who changed your diapers.\" And that's when she hit me with the question: Could she see? I didn't get it at first. Maybe I just didn't want to get it. Or maybe I was still a little foggy from my most recent dose of chemotherapy. \"See what?\" I asked. \"Your chest,\" she replied.Oh boy.Oh. Dear. God.My breasts still bore the angry red scars from my bilateral mastectomy. I couldn't stand to look at myself; how could I show her? But I'd just mini-lectured her about not being shy about her body and her developing breasts. Could I really be so hypocritical in all of three minutes? Also, I didn't really have breasts. Under my flat chest were tissue expanders -- place holders, if you will. These devices were inserted immediately after my breasts were removed, while I was still in the operating room. The expanders were filled, a little bit at time, every few weeks, with saline solution. The ever-growing expanders were intended to stretch my skin gradually, until the region could accommodate respectable \"B\" sized breast implants (in spite of my husband's not-so-subtle hint that I consider going larger). The swap-out of the tissue expanders for the implants was still many, many months away. Consequently, while I wasn't as flat as a proverbial board, I was oh, so close -- and Whit wanted to see.My hands shook nervously as I slowly unbuttoned my shirt, taking care to keep myself covered. When I got to the bottom button I looked at Whitney, but we didn't make eye contact. Her eyes were fixed on my still-hidden chest. \"Here you go,\" I said and quickly pulled open my shirt. As she took in my mutilated torso, with scars that hadn't yet begun to fade, Whitney's eyes grew large; the look on her face said it all: She was horrified. We made brief eye contact before she shifted her gaze to the floor. As I rebuttoned my shirt, I tried to think of something reassuring to say and I found myself parroting the words of my reconstructive surgeon: \"I know it doesn't look so great now, but it's going to be terrific in the end. I'll look normal again; maybe even better than normal!\"That's when the conversation shifted. \"You didn't have breast cancer when you were pregnant with me, right?\" Whitney asked. I told her she was correct and she seemed relieved. Whitney then told me, well, actually, she didn't tell me as much as she announced that she was not going to get breast cancer. Just as I was about to chime in with something like, \"I certainly hope not!\" she explained her thinking. \"Because you got it after you had me that means that you didn't give it to me and so I can't get it.\"Clearly, my burgeoning biologist had learned enough science to have a basic understanding of genetics, even if it wasn't an accurate one. I knew I should set her straight, but I didn't want to worry her. I also didn't think that the dressing room was where I wanted to be having this conversation. But hadn't I instigated all this with the \"don't be shy about your body\" talk in the first place? So I felt I had no choice but to correct Whitney's mistaken notion, in very broad terms, of course, as I was acutely aware that I was also giving an unasked-for genetics lesson to the moms and daughters in stalls near ours -- who simply thought they were entering the dressing room to try on clothes!After my master-class in Bio 101, I told Whitney that it was my sincere hope -- and belief -- that by the time she was old enough to worry about such things, breast cancer would be a thing of the past. That smart doctors and researchers would come up with a vaccine to prevent it from happening in the first place. \"But what if they don't?\" she wanted to know.Oh God, Whitney. What if they don't? But she was only 11. She had time. So much time before she needed to worry about this.This year, my daughter went for her first mammogram. The medical community recommends that young women like Whitney, \"with a history,\" begin their breast cancer screening about 10 years before their mother was first diagnosed. When Whitney called to tell me that all went well, I could hear the cheerfulness in her voice. I forced myself to mimic her tone and made some excuse about being on the way out the door and rushed her off the phone. And then I burst into uncontrollable sobs. What was wrong with me? My daughter just called to tell me she was fine. I should feel relieved, grateful, ecstatic.But.I couldn't help thinking about all those hopes and dreams I had for Whitney -- all the things I wanted to give her. My heart -- the one that sits underneath those fake breasts that will never look like my originals, no matter what the reconstructive surgeon said -- quite literally ached as I thought about the legacy I've given my daughter, who is no longer a little girl, but old enough to get mammograms (!) and old enough to have to worry about the elephant in the room: What she may be sharing with her mother some day.Months have passed since Whitney's first mammogram and I've had time to revise my thinking a bit. Maybe I'm just trying to be optimistic, but maybe the breast cancer worry I've given my daughter is a veiled blessing. Early detection still remains the very best way to save lives. So because I have already walked the walk, Whitney is being carefully screened and watched in the hope that she never has to follow in my footsteps. But if she does, it's likely they'll catch it early and she, like me, will survive.

Constance Johnson (D-Oklahoma City), would make it legal for adults over age 21 in Oklahoma to buy, possess and consume up to an ounce of cannabis. State residents would also be allowed to grow up to five marijuana plants in a secure area at home, out of public view.The tax-and-regulate bill, which is known as Senate Bill 2116, tasks the state Department of Health with licensing growers, testing facilities and retail marijuana stores where the buds would be sold along with other marijuana products.The bill would also significantly reduce penalties for Oklahoma residents younger than 21 who are caught with under an ounce of weed. The current law allows persons under age 21 to be imprisoned for a year for possessing even a crumb of cannabis. Johnson's law would instead require them to attend a drug awareness class of up to four hours in length. First offenders' criminal records would be kept clean.Oklahoma ranks third in the country for draconian marijuana laws, according to the Marijuana Policy Project, a Washington, D.C.-based organization working to reform marijuana laws across the country. In the state, the sale of any amount of cannabis will land someone in jail for two years to life.However, the odds of the bill becoming law this year are slim. The state legislature has a history of voting down efforts to reform the state's harsh pot laws, evidenced last year when it shot down a medical marijuana bill. Even if the bill made it through the state congress, Republican Gov. Mary Fallin has said she is against legalizing the drug because she believes it would lead to substance abuse and car accidents.Still, Johnson believes the tides are turning.

We've been given plenty of new features in the meantime \u2013 some good like Snapchat-cloned Stories, some bad like photo albums \u2013 but we still can't share Live Photos. There is a workaround, though \u2013 you'll just have to be okay with converting your pics to Boomerangs to be able to post them. We don't have true Live Photo functionality, which might have something to do with the reliance on Apple's 3D Touch to activate them, but at least your best shots can still be shared somehow.  The direct path to getting your Live Photos up on IG is to post them to your Story. It's easy \u2013 but there are a few limits to your sharing. First you have to convert your pics to Boomerangs, and you can only post Live Photos taken in the last 24 hours.  To make it happen, open your Instagram app and swipe right to access your Stories.Once you're there, resist the urge to share an update with your followers directly on the app. You have more pressing business here. Swipe up on the screen, and you'll be able to choose from the pictures in your camera roll from the last 24 hours. Once you've selected your pic, converting it to a Boomerang is simple. All you need to do 3D Touch the screen in the exact same way you'd typically force a Live Photo into action.From there, you can post the Boomerang on your Story, send it to separate followers or even save it for later to your Camera Roll. After you do that, you can post it directly to your IG, just like any other Boomerang.I've seen other guides that claim you can use secondary apps to convert your Live Photos to videos to post on IG, but there's a major issue with that method: Instagram only allows you to post video content longer than three seconds. Live Photos are made by capturing the 1.5 seconds before and after you take the pic. That means the newly-converted videos wind up right under that three second limit.   I wanted to test a few of the apps to be sure, so I gave Lively and LP Converter a shot. They converted the Live Photos, just as advertised \u2014 but none of the videos could be uploaded to Instagram.  For now, it looks like the only way to get some semblance of a Live Photo up on IG is through Boomerang. We can still hold out hope that they'll make it onto your newsfeed someday, though \u2013 so Instagram, next time you decide to add a feature that could cause your own untimely demise, maybe give us some Live Photos along with it.", "answers": {"answer_start": [710], "text": ["converting your pics to Boomerangs"]}, "id": "843575223102398464"}, {"question": "Watch out Reese's there's a new peanut butter cup coming to town", "context": "Nestle\u0301 is debuting a new candy bar in 2014: the Butterfinger Peanut Butter Cup.

Rather than rising levels of well-being, we've seen mounting credit card debt and increasing numbers of self-storage facilities to house the things we compulsively buy.The holidays in particular have become a time when consumer culture comes out in full force. Black Friday, the annual post-Thanksgiving discount shopping spree, results each year in multiple deaths and injuries of consumers trampled by crowds in stores and shopping malls.In a poignant, viral Huffington Post blog last month, \"If You Shop On Thanksgiving, You're Part Of The Problem,\" writer Matt Walsh cast a harsh light on what the holiday shopping frenzy really says about our culture:That's our entire economic system: buy things. Everybody buy. It doesn't matter what you buy. Just buy. It doesn't matter if you don't have money. Just buy. Our entire civilization now rests on the assumption that, no matter what else happens, we will all continue to buy lots and lots of things. Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy. And then buy a little more. Don't create, or produce, or discover -- just buy. Never save, never invest, never cut back -- just buy. Buy what you don't need with money you don't have... Buy like you breathe, only more frequently.To some extent, most of us participate in consumer culture and value material possessions, and that's perfectly fine. But in excess, materialism can take a toll on your well-being, relationships and quality of life. Here are six things you should know about the psychology of consumption -- and strategies to find freedom from materialism.Consumer culture may be harming individual well-being.Research suggests that Americans' well-being has, if anything, declined since the 1950s, according to the American Psychological Association, while our consumption has only increased.\"Compared with their grandparents, today's young adults have grown up with much more affluence, slightly less happiness and much greater risk of depression and assorted social pathology,\" David G. Myers, author of The American Paradox: Spiritual Hunger in an Age of Plenty, wrote in an American Psychologist article. \"Our becoming much better off over the last four decades has not been accompanied by one iota of increased subjective well-being.\"The materialistic values that consumer cultures support may be to blame. Those who pursue wealth and material possessions tend to be less satisfied and experience fewer positive emotions each day. On the other hand, research has found that life satisfaction -- surprise, surprise -- is correlated with having less materialistic values.Materialist values are linked to Type-A behavior.Are you highly ambitious and competitive? It could mean you're also more materialistic. Australian research from the 1990s found materialist values and a possessions-based definition of success share common characteristics with type-A behaviors, including competitiveness and aggression. A 2008 study published in the Journal of Pacific Rim Psychology reiterated the finding that the desire to accumulate wealth and possessions is related to Type-A qualities.Money really can't buy you happiness.The Beatles wisely noted that money can't buy love, and we'd do well to remember that money can't buy happiness, either. Research has shown that there is no direct correlation between income and happiness. Once our basic needs are met, wealth makes very little difference to one's overall well-being and happiness. And in fact, extremely wealthy people actually suffer from higher rates of depression.\"The failure of additional wealth and consumption to help people have satisfying lives may be the most eloquent argument for reevaluating our current approach to consumption,\" the authors of Worldwatch Institute's 2011 State of Consumption report wrote.Some data, however, has suggested that there could be a link between higher income and increased life satisfaction. It seems that it may not be the money itself that leads to dissatisfaction, but rather, the continual striving for greater wealth and more possessions that is linked to unhappiness.Materialism could ruin your relationships.Can money buy you love? Not so much, and according to a study published in the Journal Of Couple & Marriage Therapy, materialism is actually correlated with unhappiness in marriages. Researchers studied more than 1,700 couples to find that those in which both partners had high levels of materialism exhibited lower marital quality than couples with lower materialism scores. Previous studies have found that students with higher extrinsic, materialistic values tend to have lower-quality relationships, and to feel less connected to others.Materialistic people also typically have less pro-social and empathetic qualities, both towards others and towards the environment.Consumer cultures may breed narcissistic personalities.Some psychologists have suggested that consumer cultures may contribute to the development of narcissistic personalities and behaviors, \"by focusing individuals on the glorification of consumption,\" psychologist Tim Kasser wrote in The High Price Of Materialism. Narcissists generally act with arrogance and are deeply concerned with issues of personal adequacy, seeking power and prestige to cover for feelings of inner emptiness and low-self worth, Kasser explains.\"Narcissists' desire for external validation fits well with our conception of materialistic values as extrinsic and focused on others' praise,\" he writes. \"Thus it was not surprising to find that students with strong materialistic tendencies scored high on a standard measure of narcissism, agreeing with statements such as 'I am more capable than other people' ... 'I wish somebody would write my biography someday.'\"Consumerism is fueled by insecurity -- and remedied by mindfulness.Research suggests that materialistic values are fueled by insecurity. A 2002 study published in the journal Psychology and Marketing found that those who chronically doubt themselves and their own self-worth tend to be more materialistic.Consumerism -- which has been called a \"modern religion\" -- tends to capitalize on this insecurity and use it to sell products.\"In a practical sense, consumerism is a belief system and culture that promotes consuming as the path to self- and social improvement,\" Stephanie Kaza, University of Vermont Environment Professor and Buddhism practitioner, wrote in Tricycle: The Buddhist Review. \"As a dominant cultural force, consumerism offers products to address every dissatisfaction.\"So what's the antidote? Mindfulness -- the focused awareness on the present moment, which can be cultivated through meditation and contemplative practice -- may be an effective remedy to empty or compulsive consumption. As beat writer and American Buddhist thinker Allen Ginsberg put it in a 1966 letter to the Washington Post: \"You own twice as much rug if you're twice as aware of the rug.\"Americans are redefining success beyond money and power.Our collective definition of the American Dream is slowly starting to change from one of materialism to a more purposeful idea of what it means to live the good life. According to the 2013 LifeTwist study, only around one-quarter of Americans still believe that wealth determines success.\"Dozens of the survey\u2019s findings reflect a new American notion of success, but perhaps none more starkly than the sentiment that Americans ranked 'having a lot of money' 20th on a list of 22 possible contributors to having a successful life,\" the LifeTwist Study's authors wrote in a press release. \"This sentiment mirrors the steadily rising trend ... that Americans are increasingly placing greater priority on living a fulfilling life \u2013- in which being wealthy is not the most significant factor.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [518], "text": ["shopping"]}, "id": "412277224008851457"}, {"question": "You're Not Going To Believe What This Kitten Can't Stop Doing After Being Rescued", "context": "Imagine if you were an animal trapped in a shelter.

The business, she said, chose her, not the other way around.The daughter of Morton's The Steakhouse founder Arnie Morton, she was practically raised in the restaurant industry. She wasn't even 30 years old when, in 1989, she opened a popular restaurant called Mirador in Chicago's Old Town neighborhood.Mirador was celebrated by food critics and diners alike -- so much so that the restaurant and its connected lounge, The Blue Room, were frequently packed. But it wasn't long before Morton realized that something was missing.\"We'd have the busiest days [at Mirador], and I'd look out at the dining room and sit there and just feel empty,\" Morton told The Huffington Post. \"I was not a terribly pleasant person. I was really rough on people and had the shortest fuse and lost my temper. I didn't like who that was. I was not happy.\"One day, somebody knocked on Mirador's door and asked to buy the space. Morton knew she'd found her way out. The restaurant closed in 1993, and she decided to start over.Though she continued to work in the restaurant industry as a way to pay the bills -- she founded her own consulting firm and later worked as director of operations for a restaurant group -- her path to self-discovery became a central focus.She said it all started \"accidentally\" with a trip to visit friends in Thailand. That trip, she said, was \"just like aha after aha after aha\" and sparked an interest in Buddhism.From there, Morton took up regular meditation and participated in a four-year program with the Florida-based Barbara Brennan School of Healing. She also tried Landmark Education after her friend Chicago restaurateur Gordon Sinclair \"sort of opened the window\" on that self-help training program, which claims to improve the lives of its participants and counts Lululemon founder Chip Wilson among its most ardent supporters.Slowly, she said, everything \"clicked into place.\"\"Along this path, another side of myself that had always existed became much more prevalent,\" she said.In the years that followed, Morton met her husband, Neal, and had three daughters. Her father passed away in 2005. And in November 2012, she opened her new restaurant -- Found Kitchen and Social House, just north of Chicago in Evanston, Ill. -- to more acclaim and high demand. Earlier this year, she begrudgingly began allowing reservations because waiting times were growing so long.\"I always wanted Found to be a place people could walk into, but our clientele really wanted this,\" she said, noting that the restaurant still holds some \"neighborhood tables\" for walk-in diners. \"I feel like listening is important.\"Morton, now 50, came to the realization that she wanted to open another restaurant five years prior to establishing Found, but she knew she shouldn't rush the process. She attributes the delay to the ongoing process of coming to better terms with her inner self, working past self-doubt and second-guessing.\"It was a process of me finding myself,\" she said of the restaurant's concept developing into a reality. \"Eventually, I figured out that even if it failed, I had to try it. I would be more regretful not having tried it even if it failed because I'd always be wondering.\"Morton's new business is a direct reflection of the lessons she learned along her personal journey. The restaurant focuses on rustic New American dishes, served in a \"relaxed, creative\" atmosphere that is \"inspired by 1920s Bohemian Paris and icons of the Beat Generation\" and furnished with almost entirely \"salvaged\" furniture and decor, according to its website. Found chef Nicole Pederson relies on locally sourced, in-season ingredients whenever possible.Inside the dining room at Found.But Found has a mission beyond serving great food. The restaurant runs a pop-up \"Moveable Feast\" dinner series that benefits a different local charity each month and offers its space at cost for nonprofit groups to use every first Monday of the month.Morton, who serves on the board of the Evanston-based nonprofit Connections for the Homeless, also makes it a point to hire and train individuals coming out of homelessness. While the initiative has had \"a couple unbelievable success stories just in this short time that have been worth everything,\" she acknowledged there have been some struggles, too.\"Most of the time our hires haven't worked out for various reasons, and that's really frustrating, too,\" Morton said. \"It's heartbreaking when I can't hire people, people who I know really need a job but I know it's not going to be a right fit. It's still a business and not a social service agency.\"In an effort that might help address that problem, Morton is involved in early conversations around establishing a culinary arts training school in Evanston that would be focused on \"serving a more marginalized population.\"Though Found is already a commercial success -- which she is \"incredibly proud of\" -- Morton said she still yearns for success in a different sense.\"I feel so much more needs to be done,\" she said. \"It's wonderful feeding people, but there is a difference between feeding people of wealth and working with people who need that steppingstone to living a more independent life.

(Mike Groll/AP)In many states, extra punishment is meted out to those who commit crimes against others because of their race or religion. Such hate-crime laws elevate the heinousness of crimes in which people are targeted because of their identity, their belonging to a group.While hate-crime laws often refer to ethnicity or disability or gender, Louisiana is about to do something different. The state is poised to become the first in the nation where public-safety personnel will be a protected class under hate-crime law \u2014 a move that comes amid a simmering national debate about police shootings and whether that debate has given rise to an anti-law-enforcement climate.The Louisiana legislation has been referred to as \"Blue Lives Matter\" \u2014 a phrase popularized in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, which exploded following the fatal 2014 police shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Mo.[Police officers experience fewer deaths these days \u2014 but increased tension]Black Lives Matter activists have protested what they deem as excessive force by police, and they have called attention to specific instances in which police shot unarmed civilians.But those who respond with \"Blue Lives Matter\" argue it\u2019s officers who are under assault \u2014 that criticism of police fosters animosity toward law enforcement. In Louisiana, there were eight line-of-duty deaths among law-enforcement officers in 2015, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page.Louisiana House Bill 953 faced little opposition from lawmakers; the House passed it 91 to 0, and the state Senate approved it 33 to 3. The bill now heads to the desk of Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), the son of a sheriff who has indicated that he plans to sign HB 953 into law.Some states have floated proposals similar to the Louisiana legislation, and a bill proposed in Congress would amend federal hate-crime law to include officers as a protected class.\"Talking heads on television and inflammatory rhetoric on social media are inciting acts of hatred and violence toward our nation\u2019s peace officers,\" Chuck Canterbury, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, said in a statement. \"Our members are increasingly under fire by individuals motivated by nothing more than a desire to kill or injure a cop.\"In 2015, 124 officers died in the line of duty, according to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund. The number of officers fatally shot declined, falling to 42 from 49 a year earlier, while the overall number of deaths increased because of more traffic accidents and job-related illnesses.Fatal shootings of officers has decreased over the previous few decades \u2014 from an average of 127 in the 1970s to 57 yearly between 2000 and 2009.But many officers and their relatives have said they feel greater tension with the increased attention to fatal shootings by police.Louisiana state Rep. Lance Harris (R), who authored the hate-crime bill, has pointed to high-profile cases in arguing for his bill.According to the Advocate, Louisiana\u2019s largest daily newspaper, Harris cited the brazen and deadly ambush of two New York police officers in December of 2014 and a drive-by shooting that wounded a firefighter that same month in Florida.\"We have a pretty extensive hate-crime law right now, but I believe we should add firefighters and policemen,\" Harris said, according to the Advocate.[Washington Post database of police shootings]No other state includes police officers as a protected class under hate-crime laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But at least 37 states \u2014 including Louisiana \u2014 have enhanced penalties for assaulting police officers.In some states, hurting a police officer can be an \"aggravating factor\" to an assault or battery charge. And in many states, killing a police officer can be an aggravating factor or circumstance, making it a crime eligible for the death penalty.Edwards, the Louisiana governor, is expected to sign the \"Blue Lives Matter\" bill this week.According to the Advertiser, the Edwards family \"has produced four generations of Tangipahoa Parish sheriffs,\" including current Sheriff Daniel Edward, the governor\u2019s brother.[Ferguson activist accused of prostituting a 17-year-old girl]\"As the son and brother of a sheriff, I have the greatest respect for the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to serve and protect our communities, state and nation,\" Edwards said in a statement. \"Police officers and firefighters often perform life-saving acts of heroism, oftentimes under very dangerous circumstances, and are integral in maintaining order and civility in our society.\"The members of the law enforcement community deserve these protections, and I look forward to signing this bill into law.\"There has been criticism of the measure outside of the state Capitol.

The coins also developed sharp edges that could cut fingers.He believes the company destroyed or threw away most of its stock. He said he tried to contact the previous owner to find out where he got the survivor, but without luck.In 1943, the Mint made pennies from low-grade steel covered with zinc. Those shiny coins came with their own problems, including looking too much like a dime.

The group's findings were set to be released in March.For years there have been allegations that Bob Jones University had been stifling the reporting of sexual assaults, and the school's decision to dismiss GRACE late last month -- mere weeks before its report would be made public -- has therefore been criticized by former students and others affiliated with the school.\"As always, they\u2019re worried about protecting the church and the university, not the victims,\" Camille Lewis, a former Bob Jones student and faculty member, told the New York Times.Others associated with the school said they had always suspected the investigation \"was too good to be true.\" Speaking with local station WYYF News 4, former Bob Jones student Erin Burchwell said she had hoped the GRACE report would validate her allegations.Burchwell said a male student molested her several times in the 1990s, but when she reported the abuse, school officials requested she not go to the police. She told the outlet that administrators also seemed to imply the assaults were partly her fault.\"What was I wearing when all these incidents occurred? What did I have on? Was it tight? Was it low? Obviously, the point being it was somehow my fault,\" she told WYYF News 4.On Feb. 6, GRACE posted a notice about the university's decision to terminate the agreement \"days before [it] was to conduct the last interviews.\" A representative declined to comment further when contacted by The Huffington Post on Wednesday.In a video posted on the school's website, President Stephen Jones stressed it was the university's decision to look back at cases of alleged abuse. He vowed to finish the investigation with or without GRACE.\"GRACE had begun going beyond the originally outlined intentions,\" he said. \"Since the termination, we have intended to immediately negotiate a new contract with GRACE that would enable them to complete the review to achieve our objectives ... It's disappointing that we were not able to have that conversation and reach agreement and continue the process before GRACE went public with it.\"This is not the first time questions surrounding Bob Jones' sexual assault policies have surfaced. In November, Al Jazeera America spoke to several Bob Jones students who said the school's strict moral guidelines made talking about abuse difficult.\"The typical response to sexual abuse is first they need to forgive their abuser, and second is that they shouldn\u2019t talk about it or it will hurt the cause of Christ,\" Jeffrey Hoffman, an alumni of the Bob Jones elementary, junior high and high school academies, told the news outlet. Hoffman told Al Jazeera he was molested on church premises by a Sunday school teacher when he was a boy.The school's handbook forbids \"physical contact between unmarried men and women\" and counts \"hard-core pornography, sensual behavior or use of alcohol or drugs\" as a major moral failure.Bob Jones University spokesman Randy Page previously told Al Jazeera that hiring GRACE was a \"proactive\" measure and not prompted by any incident.\"When cases of abuse are reported, BJU will place the interests of the victim first,\" Page told the outlet. \"BJU believes that a victim of abuse or neglect is not to blame for the abuse foisted on him or her.

But, as the younger Mr. Trump wrote in \"The Art of the Deal,\" nobody was doing that by the 1980s because \"it\u2019s not profitable and government subsidies have been eliminated.\" So the younger Mr. Trump shifted toward higher-profile projects in Manhattan, which also depended on government assistance in the form of tax abatements.His earliest major construction deal in Manhattan was the redevelopment of the Commodore Hotel near Grand Central Terminal, now the glass-covered Grand Hyatt. Mr. Trump sought and won a 40-year property tax abatement (one so long it is still in place today) over the objections of other hotel operators. Before that, he helped persuade the city to build the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on a former Penn Central rail yard on the Far West Side; Trump earned an $833,000 fee when the city bought the land, on which he held a purchase option.A lot of conservatives have criticized public spending on convention centers as a subsidy to the hotel industry, but Mr. Trump called the publicly funded convention center project \"critical to reviving the city\u2019s image and, ultimately, to putting its economy back on track.\"When seeking tax abatements and zoning variances for his private projects, Mr. Trump emphasized how great his developments would be for the city. The tax breaks for the Grand Hyatt, he said, were the only way to stop the existing building from becoming a closed, blighted eyesore. His planned Television City development (a now scrapped proposal to bring NBC to a site on the Hudson River in the West 60s) would bring \"business worth at least $500 million a year from new residents.\"Sometimes public officials bought these arguments and sometimes they didn\u2019t. But nowhere in the book is there a contention that he shouldn\u2019t have to make them. Never does he say that it\u2019s none of the government\u2019s business how he does business.This is more evidence for what some conservatives have been shouting with increasing alarm: Donald Trump is not one of us, does not share a gut-level suspicion of government, is not a true believer in free enterprise. Mr. Trump is an enthusiast of business, but as conservative critics of \"crony capitalism\" emphasize, being pro-business is not the same as being pro-market.That said, while \"The Art of the Deal\" is not antigovernment in general, it does contain a lot of complaints about specific actions of government. For example, he disliked Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1986 tax reform, which abolished various tax deductions related to real estate. This move, he wrote, \"will be a disaster for the country, since it eliminates the incentives to invest and build \u2014 particularly in secondary locations, where no building will occur unless there are incentives.\" That is, while Mr. Trump is running on a platform of tax simplification today, he was against it 30 years ago.Parts of the book presage Mr. Trump\u2019s recent rants about \"stupid\" politicians. Mayor Ed Koch, he wrote, \"has achieved something quite miraculous. He\u2019s presided over an administration that is both pervasively corrupt and totally incompetent.\" One chapter is devoted to an almost gleeful description of how the construction of an ice rink in Central Park was botched \u2014 they tried to build it on a slope, can you believe that? \u2014 and then Mr. Trump took over and got done in six months what the city had failed to do inside six years.But these are not so much arguments against government as against stupidity. Cost overruns on the Javits Center could have been avoided, Mr. Trump wrote, if the city had awarded the construction contract to him as he had suggested. Not surprisingly, this year, he has talked about the need for infrastructure spending with the zeal of many Democrats \u2014 while insisting he can deliver needed upgrades much more cheaply than the government would.Twenty-nine years is a long time, and \"The Art of the Deal,\" which he wrote with Tony Schwartz, who is now a contributor to The New York Times, will not necessarily be Mr. Trump\u2019s blueprint for governing. But in his campaign speeches, Mr. Trump has often echoed the meddlesome approach to business he learned from New York City officials. As president, Mr. Trump likes to say, he\u2019d call up the chief of Ford with a threat: Move your factories back from Mexico or I\u2019ll slap a huge tax on your imports.This is antithetical to the conservative approach that says markets, not the government, should determine the allocation of business capital.

But almost all rely on a teaching tool that\u2019s barely changed in more than a century. To learn how to lead companies, MBA students read hundreds of case studies\u2014stripped-down narratives about a strategy problem at a real company\u2014and discuss how they would tackle the challenge.For Harvard Business School, which created and popularized the method\u2014 the school taught its first case in 1912\u2014case studies are a cottage industry as well as a bedrock of the curriculum. Harvard Business Publishing says it sells to about 4,000 schools globally; its cases account for 80 percent of the case studies used.HBP, which also publishes other business materials and the Harvard Business Review, had revenue of $194 million in 2014, according to the business school\u2019s annual report, a 44 percent increase from 2010. The publisher says it sold 12 million cases last year, to schools, companies, and others, and that and sales totaled about $30 million. Retail prices run from $9 to $15 for a basic case study; schools get discounts.\"The case method takes the learner through a reflective and analytic process that is very powerful,\" says Robert Bruner, dean of the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business. Some of Harvard\u2019s case studies seem hardly more sophisticated than Wikipedia entries, and that\u2019s deliberate, says Willis Emmons, director of Harvard\u2019s C. Roland Christensen Center for Teaching and Learning. \"Our cases are intentionally very limited in the amount of analysis they include,\" he says. \"The challenge for the student is to take both qualitative and quantitative information and make sense of that.\"HBP also sells teaching notes for business professors to facilitate class discussion of the cases. These include suggestions for specific words instructors should write on blackboards. At Harvard Business School, professors are given detailed profiles of their students, called class cards, that dictate the order and timing of whom they call on in a typical 80-minute class. \"The stronger and more experienced a faculty member is, the less visible it is how much work has gone into a session,\" says Emmons.The sheer scale of Harvard\u2019s publishing machine helps it maintain dominance in the case market. Darden Business Publishing calls itself the second-biggest publisher of cases in the U.S., but it sold fewer than 700,000 cases in 2014, according to Steve Momper, DBP\u2019s executive director. HBP produces and distributes co-branded case studies for about 40 business schools. These include the University of California at Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, which launched a case series last year. Haas has no designs on challenging Harvard\u2019s market share; the school publishes cases to strengthen its brand and showcase the technology industry expertise of its Bay Area-based staff, says Richard Lyons, the dean.Case publishers often try to add variety to material that, well into the 1970s, featured subjects that were \"virtually always male and in settings that were quite prominently in the U.S.,\" says Darden\u2019s Bruner, who received an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1974. HBS is trying to reflect a more modern business landscape. In 2014, Nitin Nohria, dean of the business school, pledged to raise the share of women protagonists in Harvard cases to 20 percent. Cases increasingly incorporate video and Web-based elements, and a few find business lessons in unconventional sources, such as the case HBP published last year by Harvard professor Anita Elberse devoted to Beyonce\u0301\u2019s surprise 2013 album release.Of the 25 top business schools ranked by Bloomberg Businessweek last year, 19 reported that they use case studies as one of their main teaching tools.

It considers them a supplement to management science, a teaching method developed at Tepper. \"The school was really founded to find an alternative approach to business education than the one that was being offered by schools like Harvard,\" says Dammon. \"In a case study, the relevant set of facts is laid out for you.

As a result I checked out several laptops from a programmer's viewpoint. The winner in my book? The 2016 Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition. I'm in good company. Linus Torvalds, Linux's creator, agrees. The Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, for him, is the best laptop around.Torvald's requirements may not be yours though.On Google+, Torvalds explained, \"First off: I don't use my laptop as a desktop replacement, and I only travel for a small handful of events each year. So for me, the laptop is a fairly specialized thing that doesn't get daily (or even weekly) use, so the main criteria are not some kind of \"average daily use\", but very much \"travel use\".Therefore, for Torvalds, \"I end up caring a lot about it being fairly small and light, because I may end up carrying it around all day at a conference. I also want it to have a good screen, because by now I'm just used to it at my main desktop, and I want my text to be legible but small.\"The Dell's display is powered by Intel's Iris 540 GPU. In my experience it works really well.The Iris powers a 13.3 inch display with a 3,200\u00d71,800 touchscreen. That's 280 pixels per inch, 40 more than my beloved 2015 Chromebook Pixel and 60 more than a MacBook Pro with Retina.However, getting that hardware to work and play well with the Gnome desktop isn't easy. As Torvalds explained in another post, it \"has the same resolution as my desktop, but apparently because the laptop screen is smaller, Gnome seems to decide on its own that I need an automatic scaling factor of 2, which blows up all the stupid things (window decorations, icons etc) to a ridiculous degree\".The solution? You can forget about looking to the user interface. You need to go to the shell and run: gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor 1.Torvalds may use Gnome, but he's never liked the Gnome 3.x family much. I can't argue with him. That's why I use Cinnamon instead.He also wants \"a reasonably powerful CPU, because when I'm traveling I still build the kernel a lot. I don't do my normal full 'make allmodconfig' build between each pull request like I do at home, but I'd like to do it more often than I did with my previous laptop, which is actually (along with the screen) the main reason I wanted to upgrade.\"Linus doesn't describe the features of his XPS 13, but my review unit was a high-end model. It came with dual-core, 2.2GHz 6th Generation Intel Core i7-6560U Skylake processor and 16GBs of DDR3 RAM with a half a terabyte, PCIe solid state drive (SSD). I'm sure Torvalds' system is at least that well-equipped.Some features you may care about aren't on Torvalds' list.\"What I don't tend to care about is touch-screens, because my fingers are big and clumsy compared to the text I'm looking at (I also can't handle the smudges: maybe I just have particularly oily fingers, but I really don't want to touch that screen). I also don't care deeply about some 'all day battery life', because quite frankly, I can't recall the last time I didn't have access to power. I might not want to bother to plug it in for some quick check, but it's just not a big overwhelming issue. By the time battery life is in 'more than a couple of hours', I just don't care very much any more.\"Dell claims the XPS 13, with its 56wHR, 4-Cell Battery, has about a 12-hour battery life. It has well over 10 in my experience. I haven't tried to run it down to the dregs.Torvalds also didn't have any trouble with the Intel Wi-Fi set. The non Developer Edition uses a Broadcom chip set and that has proven troublesome for both Windows and Linux users. Dell technical support was extremely helpful to me in getting this problem under control.Some people have trouble with the XPS 13 touchpad. Neither I nor Torvalds have any worries. Torvalds wrote, the \"XPS13 touchpad works very well for me. That may be a personal preference thing, but it seems to be both smooth and responsive.\"Still, while Torvalds likes the XPS 13, he's also fond of the latest Lenovo X1 Carbon, HP Spectre 13 x360, and last year's Lenovo Yoga 900. Me? I like the XPS 13 Developer Editor. The price tag, which for the model I reviewed was $1949.99, may keep you from reaching for your credit card.Still, if you want to develop like one of the world's top programmers, the Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition is worth the money.", "answers": {"answer_start": [205], "text": ["Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition"]}, "id": "52nro8"}, {"question": "European men grew HOW much taller in just one century?", "context": "Men are reaching new heights, at least in Europe where a new study has found that the average height of European males increased by 11 centimeters in over one century.The research, published Monday in the journal Oxford Economic Papers, looked at data from the 1870s to 1980.

In his first press conference since his election, Trump lumped pharmaceutical firms in with the car companies that so far have borne the brunt of his Twitter feed for moving operations abroad. \"We\u2019ve got to get our drug industry back,\" he said. \"They supply our drugs but they don\u2019t make them here, to a large extent.\" Afterward, pharmaceutical stocks around the world plunged, partly on Trump\u2019s promise to cut drug prices but also on concerns that companies could face the same choice he\u2019s proposed for carmakers: make it in the U.S. or face punitive tariffs.For the most part, no. About 75 percent of U.S. spending on drugs is for products that are manufactured domestically. The expiration dates on medicines mean it pays to be nearer to the end consumer. Being close to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in a tightly regulated industry doesn\u2019t hurt either. Nevertheless, because of the sheer size of the American market -- the biggest in the world by far -- the $86 billion of medicine brought in from the rest of the world in 2015 still makes the U.S. the biggest drug importer on the planet. The value of those imports has almost doubled since 2005.In 2015, the U.S.\u2019s top five sources of pharmaceutical imports by value were Ireland, Germany, the U.K., Switzerland and India. With the exception of India, those countries aren\u2019t exactly places to find cheap labor. Yet Germany, the U.K. and Switzerland are home to some of the world\u2019s biggest research-based pharmaceutical companies, firms that develop new drugs and then manufacture what they design. Germany and Switzerland are also headquarters to the two largest contract manufacturers for biological medicines. Whereas most drugs are chemically synthesized, biologics come from human, animal or micro-organism sources and require a great deal of know-how and high-tech equipment to make.Ireland is the biggest source of U.S. imports, accounting for $25 billion of drugs in 2015. It has emerged as a center of pharmaceutical manufacturing largely in the past decade as its low corporate tax rate and other incentives attracted $8 billion in investment. Nine of the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world now have operations in Ireland. The country\u2019s tax policies have proved so attractive to drug and medical-device companies that some, including Allergan, Medtronic and Shire, have made Dublin their legal address. The U.S. may have put a stop to these so-called tax inversions with rule changes last year. After the Treasury issued the revisions, U.S.-based Pfizer and AbbVie abandoned their planned mergers with Irish-based companies.India represents a different case from the European countries on the list. Rather than producing small volumes of high-priced, innovative medicines, Indian companies specialize in large volumes of cheap generics. These are copies of drugs whose U.S. patent protection has expired. Generics are essentially a commodity where the producer with the lowest production cost wins the market. They now make up eight of 10 prescriptions filled in the U.S., though because they are so much less expensive than branded drugs they account for only about 22 percent of total spending on pharmaceuticals. With manufacturing costs in India as much as 50 percent lower than in Western industrialized countries, India has become the biggest exporter of generics in the world. Sales of generic medicines in the U.S. reached $70 billion in 2015, and that\u2019s expected to grow as more medicines go off patent.The Indians and Chinese say Americans would pay higher prices if they made more of their own generics and drug components. That would put Trump in a bind given that he\u2019s also said he wants to bring down prices. In the U.S., the cost of a generic drug, the kind that India specializes in producing, is estimated to be 80 percent to 85 percent lower than that of the brand-name equivalent.

The world-famous store, on London\u2019s Oxford Street, rolled out Coffee Spread on 4 April, to coincide with UK Coffee Week which runs from 10 to 16 of April. The spread, developed by the brand Flat Brew, contains a mix of Arabica coffee beans, cocoa butter, sugar and cream which gives it a thick, black apperance. It's not surprising, then, that a 20g serving contains 91 calories, according to The Evening Standard. \"The texture of the spread smooth and similar to peanut butter, and although the alarmingly dark colour takes some getting used to, the taste is deliciously sweet - more like a coffee-infused Nutella than a bitter espresso shot,\" according to an Evening Standard writer who tried the paste.

But what\u2019s become an even more alarming trend is the number of officers involved in these killings who receive minor to no punishment.According to the According to the Wall Street Journal , 2015 saw the highest number of police officers being charged for deadly, on-duty shootings in a decade: 12 as of September 2015. Still, in a year when approximately 1,200 people were killed by police, zero officers were convicted of murder or manslaughter, painting the picture that officers involved in killing another person will not be held accountable for their actions.In 2016, several officers have gone to trial but none of them received jail time. Here are some of the most egregious examples of cops who haven\u2019t been penalized for killing:William Porter, Edward Nero, and Caesar Goodwin \u2014 Baltimore, MarylandFreddie Gray was apprehended by police during a bike patrol on April 12, 2015, when a violent arrest left him unable to walk on his own. On the way to booking, no officer put a seat belt on Gray, causing him to be thrown around the van with no help received from any of the officers. In total, there were six officers involved in his death, and three have been tried so far. But during those three trials, which spanned from December 2015 to June, none of the officers were convicted.The trial of The trial of Officer William Porter ended in a hung jury in December, amounting to no action being taken against Porter unless a second trial scheduled for later this year finds him guilty. In May, Officer Edward Nero was declared not guilty of all criminal charges against him \u2014 second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, and misconduct in office. Nero was one of the first officers to encounter Gray during his arrest and helped load Gray into the police van, where he was not secured with a seat belt.On June 23, the latest trial in Gray\u2019s case found On June 23, the latest trial in Gray\u2019s case found Officer Caesar Goodwin not guilty of second-degree depraved heart murder, reckless endangerment, second-degree assault, and manslaughter. Goodwin drove the police van where Gray suffered the spine injury that ultimately led to his death, didn\u2019t secure the 25-year-old\u2019s seat belt, and waited to call a medic when Gray was in distress. Goodson faced the most serious charges of the six officers.Peter Liang \u2014 New York CityIn April, two months after a jury convicted him of manslaughter and official misconduct, former In April, two months after a jury convicted him of manslaughter and official misconduct, former NYPD Oficer Officer Peter Liang was sentenced to five years probation and 800 hours of community service.Liang is responsible for fatally shooting 28-year-old Brooklyn resident Akai Gurley last November, in the dark stairwell of a public housing building. While Liang was in the building, the rookie cop claimed he accidentally fired his gun and the bullet ricocheted off the wall before striking Gurley in the heart. Gurley was innocent of any wrongdoing and unarmed when he was killed.During the trial, Liang claimed the shooting was accidental, but was convicted of manslaughter in February. The former officer was also convicted of official misconduct for failing to provide any sort of medical assistance to Gurley as he lay bleeding on the staircase. Following his conviction, Liang was fired from the NYPD.Just before his sentence was handed down, the manslaughter charge was reduced to criminally negligent homicide. And despite being convicted of manslaughter, Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson announced in March that jail time for Liang should be taken off the table. He recommended six months of house arrest, five years of probation, and 500 hours of community service, instead.Liang was the first NYPD officer convicted of an on-duty shooting in the past decade.Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze \u2014 Minneapolis, MinnesotaIn March, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced that the two officers involved in the fatal shooting of 24-year-old In March, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced that the two officers involved in the fatal shooting of 24-year-old Jamar Clark will not be facing any criminal charges for their actions.

Once just a small startup, the company has grown to be one of most popular messaging apps available. And as much as its users believe in it, investors do too, which is why they haven't been shy about helping with funding.Unlike messages on the platform, the money won't be disappearing any time soon.Snapchat is now looking to raise about $200 million in new funding, which means that the company can be worth a pretty penny if investors help it out.This new round of funding is an extension of the Series F round from March, where Snapchat raised $175 million from Fidelity. This fundraising gave the company a valuation of $16 billion.According to VC Experts, if Snapchat is able to raise its desired $200 million the company will then be valued at $22.7 billion. Of course this is just an estimate since this valuation is based on the fact that Snapchat would remain $30.72 per share.It would also mean that Snapchat has raised a total of more than $1.5 billon in funding.While this large valuation reveals Snapchat's success, it could also make it harder for another company to acquire it in the future the more expensive it becomes. Facebook attempted to do exactly this when it tried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion back in 2013. Snapchat continues to be privately ownedPopular among teens, Snapchat has exploded as of late.

Almost anything can be labeled \"rock\": Metallica, ABBA, Mannheim Steamroller, a haircut, a muffler. If you\u2019re a successful tax lawyer who owns a hot tub, clients will refer to you as a \"rock-star C.P.A.\" when describing your business to less-hip neighbors. The defining music of the first half of the 20th century was jazz; the defining music of the second half of the 20th century was rock, but with an ideology and saturation far more pervasive. Only television surpasses its influence.This article is adapted from the book \"But What If We're Wrong?\" to be published in June by Blue Rider Press.And pretty much from the moment it came into being, people who liked rock insisted it was dying. The critic Richard Meltzer supposedly claimed that rock was already dead in 1968. And he was wrong to the same degree that he was right. Meltzer\u2019s wrongness is obvious and does not require explanation, unless you honestly think \"Purple Rain\" is awful. But his rightness is more complicated: Rock is dead, in the sense that its \"aliveness\" is a subjective assertion based on whatever criteria the listener happens to care about.This is why the essential significance of rock remains a plausible thing to debate, as does the relative value of major figures within that system (the Doors, R.E.M., Radiohead). It still projects the illusion of a universe containing multitudes. But it won\u2019t seem that way in 300 years.The symbolic value of rock is conflict-based: It emerged as a byproduct of the post-World War II invention of the teenager, soundtracking a 25-year period when the gap between generations was utterly real and uncommonly vast. That dissonance gave rock music a distinctive, nonmusical importance for a long time. But that period is over. Rock \u2014 or at least the anthemic, metaphoric, Hard Rock Cafe version of big rock \u2014 has become more socially accessible but less socially essential, synchronously shackled by its own formal limitations. Its cultural recession is intertwined with its cultural absorption. As a result, what we\u2019re left with is a youth-oriented music genre that a) isn\u2019t symbolically important; b) lacks creative potential; and c) has no specific tie to young people. It has completed its historical trajectory. Which means, eventually, it will exist primarily as an academic pursuit. It will exist as something people have to be taught to feel and understand.I imagine a college classroom in 300 years, in which a hip instructor is leading a tutorial filled with students. These students relate to rock music with no more fluency than they do the music of Mesopotamia: It\u2019s a style they\u2019ve learned to recognize, but just barely (and only because they\u2019ve taken this specific class). Nobody in the room can name more than two rock songs, except the professor. He explains the sonic structure of rock, its origins, the way it served as cultural currency and how it shaped and defined three generations of a global superpower. He shows the class a photo, or perhaps a hologram, of an artist who has been intentionally selected to epitomize the entire concept. For these future students, that singular image defines what rock was.So what\u2019s the image?Certainly, there\u2019s one response to this hypothetical that feels immediate and sensible: the Beatles. All logic points to their dominance. They were the most popular band in the world during the period they were active and are only slightly less popular now, five decades later. The Beatles defined the concept of what a \"rock group\" was supposed to be, and all subsequent rock groups are (consciously or unconsciously) modeled upon the template they naturally embodied. Their 1964 appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" is so regularly cited as the genesis for other bands that they arguably invented the culture of the 1970s, a decade when they were no longer together. The Beatles arguably invented everything, including the very notion of a band\u2019s breaking up. There are still things about the Beatles that can\u2019t be explained, almost to the point of the supernatural: the way their music resonates with toddlers, for example, or the way it resonated with Charles Manson. It\u2019s impossible to imagine another rock group where half its members faced unrelated assassination attempts. In any reasonable world, the Beatles are the answer to the question \"Who will be the Sousa of rock?\"But our world is not reasonable. And the way this question will be asked tomorrow is (probably) not the same way we would ask it today.In Western culture, virtually everything is understood through the process of storytelling, often to the detriment of reality. When we recount history, we tend to use the life experience of one person \u2014 the \"journey\" of a particular \"hero,\" in the lingo of the mythologist Joseph Campbell \u2014 as a prism for understanding everything else. That inclination works to the Beatles\u2019 communal detriment. But it buoys two other figures: Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. The Beatles are the most meaningful group, but Elvis and Dylan are the towering individuals, so eminent that I wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to use Elvis\u2019s last name or Dylan\u2019s first.Still, neither is an ideal manifestation of rock as a concept.It has been said that Presley invented rock and roll, but he actually staged a form of primordial \"prerock\" that barely resembles the post-\"Rubber Soul\" aesthetics that came to define what this music is. He also exited rock culture relatively early; he was pretty much out of the game by 1973. Conversely, Dylan\u2019s career spans the entirety of rock. Yet he never made an album that \"rocked\" in any conventional way (the live album \"Hard Rain\" probably comes closest). Still, these people are rock people. Both are integral to the core of the enterprise and influenced everything we have come to understand about the form (including the Beatles themselves, a group that would not have existed without Elvis and would not have pursued introspection without Dylan).In 300 years, the idea of \"rock music\" being represented by a two\u2010pronged combination of Elvis and Dylan would be equitable and oddly accurate. But the passage of time makes this progressively more difficult. It\u2019s always easier for a culture to retain one story instead of two, and the stories of Presley and Dylan barely intersect (they supposedly met only once, in a Las Vegas hotel room). As I write this sentence, the social stature of Elvis and Dylan feels similar, perhaps even identical. But it\u2019s entirely possible one of them will be dropped as time plods forward. And if that happens, the consequence will be huge. If we concede that the \"hero\u2019s journey\" is the de facto story through which we understand history, the differences between these two heroes would profoundly alter the description of what rock music supposedly was.If Elvis (minus Dylan) is the definition of rock, then rock is remembered as showbiz. Like Frank Sinatra, Elvis did not write songs; he interpreted songs that were written by other people (and like Sinatra, he did this brilliantly). But removing the centrality of songwriting from the rock equation radically alters it. Rock becomes a performative art form, where the meaning of a song matters less than the person singing it. It becomes personality music, and the dominant qualities of Presley\u2019s persona \u2014 his sexuality, his masculinity, his larger\u2010than\u2010life charisma \u2014 become the dominant signifiers of what rock was. His physical decline and reclusive death become an allegory for the entire culture. The reminiscence of the rock genre adopts a tragic hue, punctuated by gluttony, drugs and the conscious theft of black culture by white opportunists.But if Dylan (minus Elvis) becomes the definition of rock, everything reverses. In this contingency, lyrical authenticity becomes everything; rock is somehow calcified as an intellectual craft, interlocked with the folk tradition. It would be remembered as far more political than it actually was, and significantly more political than Dylan himself. The fact that Dylan does not have a conventionally \"good\" singing voice becomes retrospective proof that rock audiences prioritized substance over style, and the portrait of his seven\u2010decade voyage would align with the most romantic version of how an eclectic collection of autonomous states eventually became a place called \"America.\"These are the two best versions of this potential process. And both are flawed.There is, of course, another way to consider how these things might unspool, and it might be closer to the way histories are actually built. I\u2019m creating a binary reality where Elvis and Dylan start the race to posterity as equals, only to have one runner fall and disappear. The one who remains \"wins\" by default (and maybe that happens). But it might work in reverse. A more plausible situation is that future people will haphazardly decide how they want to remember rock, and whatever they decide will dictate who is declared its architect. If the constructed memory is a caricature of big\u2010hair arena rock, the answer is probably Elvis; if it\u2019s a buoyant, unrealistic apparition of punk hagiography, the answer is probably Dylan. But both conclusions direct us back to the same recalcitrant question: What makes us remember the things we remember?In 2014, the jazz historian Ted Gioia published a short essay about music criticism that outraged a class of perpetually outraged music critics. Gioia\u2019s assertion was that 21st\u2010century music writing has devolved into a form of lifestyle journalism that willfully ignores the technical details of the music itself. Many critics took this attack personally and accused Gioia of devaluing their vocation. Which is odd, considering the colossal degree of power Gioia ascribes to record reviewers: He believes specialists are the people who galvanize history. Critics have almost no impact on what music is popular at any given time, but they\u2019re extraordinarily well positioned to dictate what music is reintroduced after its popularity has waned.\"Over time, critics and historians will play a larger role in deciding whose fame endures,\" Gioia wrote me in an email. \"Commercial factors will have less impact. I don\u2019t see why rock and pop will follow any different trajectory from jazz and blues.\" He rattled off several illustrative examples: Ben Selvin outsold Louis Armstrong in the 1920s. In 1956, Nelson Riddle and Les Baxter outsold \"almost every rock \u2019n\u2019 roll star not named Elvis,\" but they\u2019ve been virtually erased from the public record. A year after that, the closeted gay crooner Tab Hunter was bigger than Jerry Lee Lewis and Fats Domino, \"but critics and music historians hate sentimental love songs. They\u2019ve constructed a perspective that emphasizes the rise of rock and pushes everything else into the background. Transgressive rockers, in contrast, enjoy lasting fame.\" He points to a contemporary version of that phenomenon: \"Right now, electronic dance music probably outsells hip\u2010hop. This is identical to the punk\u2010versus\u2010disco trade\u2010off of the 1970s. My prediction: edgy hip\u2010hop music will win the fame game in the long run, while E.D.M. will be seen as another mindless dance craze.\"Gioia is touching on a variety of volatile ideas here, particularly the outsize memory of transgressive art. His example is the adversarial divide between punk and disco: In 1977, the disco soundtrack to \"Saturday Night Fever\" and the Sex Pistols\u2019 \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols\" were both released. The soundtrack to \"Saturday Night Fever\" has sold more than 15 million copies; it took \"Never Mind the Bollocks\" 15 years to go platinum. Yet virtually all pop historiographers elevate the importance of the Pistols above that of the Bee Gees. The same year the Sex Pistols finally sold the millionth copy of their debut, SPIN magazine placed them on a list of the seven greatest bands of all time. \"Never Mind the Bollocks\" is part of the White House record library, supposedly inserted by Amy Carter just before her dad lost to Ronald Reagan. The album\u2019s reputation improves by simply existing: In 1985, the British publication NME classified it as the 13th\u2010greatest album of all time; in 1993, NME made a new list and decided it now deserved to be ranked third. This has as much to do with its transgressive identity as its musical integrity. The album is overtly transgressive (and therefore memorable), while \"Saturday Night Fever\" has been framed as a prefab totem of a facile culture (and thus forgettable). For more than three decades, that has been the overwhelming consensus.But I\u2019ve noticed \u2014 just in the last four or five years \u2014 that this consensus is shifting. Why? Because the definition of \"transgressive\" is shifting. It\u2019s no longer appropriate to dismiss disco as superficial. More and more, we recognize how disco latently pushed gay, urban culture into white suburbia, which is a more meaningful transgression than going on a British TV talk show and swearing at the host. So is it possible that the punk\u2010disco polarity will eventually flip? Yes. It\u2019s possible everyone could decide to reverse how we remember 1977. But there\u2019s still another stage here, beyond that hypothetical inversion: the stage in which everybody who was around for punk and disco is dead and buried, and no one is left to contradict how that moment felt. When that happens, the debate over transgressions freezes and all that is left is the music. Which means the Sex Pistols could win again or maybe they lose bigger, depending on the judge.\"There is a justice-driven part of my brain that believes \u2014 or needs to believe \u2014 that the cream rises to the top, and the best work endures by virtue of its goodness,\" argues the music writer Amanda Petrusich, author of \"Do Not Sell at Any Price,\" a dive into the obsessive world of 78 r.p.m. record collectors. \"That music becomes emblematic because it\u2019s the most effective. When I think of rock and who might survive, I immediately think of the Rolling Stones. They\u2019re a band that sounds like what we\u2019ve all decided rock \u2019n\u2019 roll should sound like: loose and wild. Their story reflects that ethos and sound: loose and wild. And also, they\u2019re good.\"This is true. The Rolling Stones are good, even when they release records like \"Bridges to Babylon.\" They\u2019ve outlived every band that ever competed against them, with career album sales exceeding the present population of Brazil. From a credibility standpoint, the Rolling Stones are beyond reproach, regardless of how they choose to promote themselves: They\u2019ve performed at the Super Bowl, in a Kellogg\u2019s commercial and on an episode of \"Beverly Hills, 90210.\" The name of the biggest magazine covering rock music was partly inspired by their sheer existence. The group members have faced arrest on multiple continents, headlined the most disastrous concert in California history and classified themselves (with surprisingly little argument) as \"the greatest rock and roll band in the world\" since 1969. Working from the premise that the collective memory of rock should dovetail with the artist who most accurately represents what rock music actually was, the Rolling Stones are a strong answer.But not the final answer.NASA sent the unmanned craft Voyager I into deep space in 1977. It\u2019s still out there, forever fleeing Earth\u2019s pull. No man\u2010made object has ever traveled farther; it crossed the orbit of Pluto in 1989 and currently tumbles through the interstellar wasteland. The hope was that this vessel would eventually be discovered by intelligent extraterrestrials, so NASA included a compilation album made of gold, along with a rudimentary sketch of how to play it with a stylus. A team led by Carl Sagan curated the album\u2019s contents. The record, if played by the aliens, is supposed to reflect the diversity and brilliance of earthling life. This, obviously, presupposes a lot of insane hopes: that the craft will somehow be found, that the craft will somehow be intact, that the aliens who find it will be vaguely human, that these vaguely human aliens will absorb stimuli both visually and sonically and that these aliens will not still be listening to eight\u2010tracks.But it did guarantee that one rock song will exist even if the earth is spontaneously swallowed by the sun: \"Johnny B. Goode,\" by Chuck Berry. The song was championed by Ann Druyan (who later become Sagan\u2019s wife) and Timothy Ferris, a science writer and friend of Sagan\u2019s who contributed to Rolling Stone magazine. According to Ferris, who was the album\u2019s de facto producer, the folklorist Alan Lomax was against the selection of Berry, based on the argument that rock music was too childish to represent the highest achievements of the planet. (I\u2019m assuming Lomax wasn\u2019t too heavily engaged with the debate over the Sex Pistols and \"Saturday Night Fever\" either.) \"Johnny B. Goode\" is the only rock song on the Voyager disc, although a few other tunes were considered. \"Here Comes the Sun\" was a candidate, and all four Beatles wanted it to be included, but none of them owned the song\u2019s copyright, so it was killed for legal reasons.The fact that this happened in 1977 was also relevant to the song\u2019s selection. \"Johnny B. Goode\" was 19 years old that year, which made it seem distinguished, almost prehistoric, at the time. I suspect the main reason \"Johnny B. Goode\" was chosen is that it just seemed like a reasonable track to select. But it was more than reasonable. It was, either deliberately or accidentally, the best possible artist for NASA to select. Chuck Berry may very well become the artist society selects when rock music is retroactively reconsidered by the grandchildren of your grandchildren.Let\u2019s assume all the individual components of rock shatter and dissolve, leaving behind a hazy residue that categorizes rock \u2019n\u2019 roll as a collection of memorable tropes. If this transpires, historians will reconstitute the genre like a puzzle. They will look at those tropes as a suit and try to decide who fits that suit best. And that theoretical suit was tailored for Chuck Berry\u2019s body.Rock music is simple, direct, rhythm\u2010based music. Berry made simple, direct, rhythm\u2010based music.Rock music is black music mainstreamed by white musicians, particularly white musicians from England. Berry is a black man who directly influenced Keith Richards and Jimmy Page.Rock music is preoccupied with sex. Berry was a sex addict whose only American No. 1 single was about playing with his penis.Rock music is lawless. Berry went to prison twice before he turned 40.Rock music is tied to myth and legend (so much so that the decline of rock\u2019s prominence coincides with the rise of the Internet and the destruction of anecdotal storytelling). Berry is the subject of multiple urban legends, several of which might actually be true and which often seem to involve cheapness, violence and sexual defecation.\"If you tried to give rock and roll another name,\" John Lennon famously said, \"you might call it Chuck Berry.\" That quote is as close as we come to a full\u2010on Sousa scenario, where the person and the thing are ideologically interchangeable. Chuck Berry\u2019s persona is the purest distillation of what we understand rock music to be. The songs he made are essential, but secondary to who he was and why he made them.

That touched off a cascade of revelations that, for the first time, has allowed the Bangladeshi authorities to penetrate the murky world of the attackers and answer questions about the planning, execution and purpose of the attacks that have baffled the country \u2014 and, indeed, the world \u2014 since the violence began.Key FactsAt least 39 people have been killed in attacks with machetes, guns and bombs since February 2013. The killings, mostly with machete blows to the back of the victim\u2019s neck, have been accelerating lately, with five people murdered in April, four in May and at least three so far in June.On Sunday, a Christian grocer and the wife of a police superintendent who had been cracking down on militant attacks were killed in separate strikes. On Tuesday, a Hindu priest was killed in southwestern Bangladesh.In a lengthy interview, the chief of the police counterterrorism unit, Monirul Islam, who assumed his post in February, laid out the findings of his investigation in minute detail.The killings were organized by two militant Islamic groups that have gathered volunteers and recruits, trained them and eventually seeded them into cells run by a commander, Mr. Islam said. They have tried to pick their targets with care, with the aim of gaining support from the public, he said, and trained teams of killers. Their goal was to convert Bangladesh\u2019s mixed secular and religious culture to an Islamist one, the chief investigator said.The Bangladeshi authorities say that they now believe they have identified the top leadership of the two groups they say are responsible, and that they are preparing to round them up. Only when the leaders are caught, they caution, will the attacks be stopped, and at that, only for a while if the appeal of Islamic fundamentalism is not blunted.Secular Versus IslamistsBangladesh, a nation with a Muslim majority adjoining eastern India, gained independence from Pakistan in a vicious war in 1971 and established a secular, democratic government. A military coup in 1975 led to more than three decades of mostly military-backed governments sympathetic to Islamic fundamentalists, until a secular government returned to power in 2009 with an overwhelming majority. But secularism is far from universally accepted in Bangladesh, and has always had to contend with a conservative Islamic culture.To a surprising extent, the militants have succeeded in their aim of discrediting secularism, the chief investigator said.\"In general, people think they have done the right thing, that it\u2019s not unjustifiable to kill\" the bloggers, gay people and other secularists, he added.They have also put the secular government on the defensive. As a result, even as the government has condemned the killings, it has urged writers not to criticize Islam and warned that advocating \"unnatural sex\" is a criminal offense.Some experts say that only a more widespread crackdown will stop the killings, but that the government has held back, fearful of creating a backlash.\"The politics has been turned into the secular versus the Islamists,\" said Abdur Rashid, a retired army major general and executive director of the Institute of Conflict, Law and Development Studies in Dhaka. \"Therefore the government is cautious.\"While the killers\u2019 strikes often appear random, Mr. Islam says the terrorism campaign was conceived by the militant groups quite deliberately as a response to mass protests in early 2013, known collectively as the Shahbag movement. Inspired by a group of bloggers who led the protests, the demonstrators advocated an end to religion-based politics and the prosecution of war crimes dating to the 1971 war for independence.War crimes prosecutions have been a particular source of anger for Islamists. They were shelved during the period of military-backed rule but revived under the new democratic government in 2009. Four of the five convicted and executed in the latest round of trials were leaders in the country\u2019s largest Islamist political party, Jamaat-e-Islami, outraging Muslim fundamentalists and others.Two groups in particular took up the fight against secularism, Mr. Islam said. One, Ansar al-Islam, is led by a fiery cleric and a charismatic, well-trained operational commander, both of whom Mr. Islam declined to identify because they are being watched. Its leaders command about 25 trained killers, some of whom have been involved in three or four attacks, Mr. Islam said.The second, the Jama\u2019atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh, is the reorganized offshoot of a group banned in 2005 for setting off nearly 500 bombs simultaneously around the country.While both are radical Islamist groups, Mr. Islam said, neither seems to have direct links to larger terrorist networks like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, though those groups have occasionally claimed credit for the attacks.\u2018It Is Your Duty to Kill\u2019The Islamist groups appear to have reacted quickly to the Shahbag movement, mounting their first fatal attack on Feb. 15, 2013, against a blogger who wrote critically of Islam under the pseudonym Thaba Baba. It was carried out by a group of students from North South University in Dhaka, who were incited by the sermons of the spiritual leader of Ansar al-Islam at the time, a 45-year-old cleric named Jasim Uddin Rahmani.The students used to attend his Friday speeches at a local mosque where Mr. Rahmani, who has since been arrested, declared a fatwa on bloggers critical of Islam, calling for them to be killed, Mr. Islam said.As it happened, one of the students, a 32-year-old senior named Redwanul Azad Rana, was also a leader in Ansar al-Islam, Mr. Islam said. He invited the younger students to Mr. Rahmani\u2019s sermons and introduced them to the writings of Thaba Baba.\"Being a believer, it is your duty to kill\" Thaba Baba, Mr. Rana told the students, one of them said in his confession in court. Prodded by Mr. Rana, \"we made a plan to kill Islam\u2019s and Prophet Muhammad\u2019s insulter Thaba Baba by identifying him,\" the student, Faisal Bin Nayeem, 24, said in the statement.He said they found Thaba Baba\u2019s picture on Facebook, then searched for someone matching it at the Shahbag protest, still underway at the time. Eventually, they identified a 32-year-old architect, Ahmed Rajib Haider, as Thaba Baba. After studying Mr. Haider\u2019s routines, three of them surprised him outside his house around 9 p.m. Mr. Nayeem said he drove his machete into the back of Mr. Haider\u2019s neck and hit him twice more as he fell forward.Ansar al-Islam, with the help of mainstream Islamist groups, then began to publicize Mr. Haider\u2019s writings, casting the killers as defenders of Islam against \"atheist bloggers.\"The writings, published in at least two national dailies, enraged large segments of the population, who had previously been sympathetic to the Shahbag movement, Mr. Islam said.During the next two months, two more bloggers were killed. The police began arresting the North South University students who were involved in killing Mr. Haider, and also caught Mr. Rahmani, the cleric who inspired them. But Mr. Rana, the student leader, remains at large and is thought to have left the country.Mr. Islam said he believes these arrests stopped Ansar al-Islam \u2014 also known as the Ansarullah Bangla Team \u2014 from killing more people in 2013 and 2014. But the group reorganized the terrorist cells, he said, and the killing resumed.In February of last year, Mr. Islam said, Ansar attackers killed Avijit Roy, 42, an American citizen of Bangladeshi origin. Mr. Roy worked by day in the biotechnology industry in the United States and by night as a writer of books on science, homosexuality and religion, in addition to founding a website called Mukto-Mona, Bengali for freethinker.From the growing number of attackers in detention, the police learned that the newly reconstituted Ansar al-Islam had changed its tactics, now recruiting madrasa students and teachers instead of university students to carry out killings. Mr. Islam said a violent protest by the madrasa students in May 2013 convinced Ansar al-Islam leaders that they were a more promising source of fanatical recruits than their university counterparts.The training and indoctrination of the recruits became more rigorous and systematic at that time, Mr. Islam said. The cell that assassinated another blogger, Oyasiqur Rahman Babu, 27, just a month after Mr. Roy\u2019s killing rented an apartment where two senior operatives worked with the group of would-be killers. One, an operations expert, taught them how to kill with a machete and use a pistol to scatter anyone interrupting the attack.Armed with Mr. Babu\u2019s picture and his address, the assassins were sent to his home to assess the situation and returned to a barrage of questions from the trainer. \"What happens if you are stopped? What will you do?\" he asked them, Mr. Islam said.Close to the planned date of the attack, the other operative, an ideologist, introduced the killers to Mr. Babu\u2019s writings. The students were given samples calculated to stir them up. \"What is the punishment for someone who writes these insults?\" the trainer asked them. The group answered in unison, day after day, \"Only death,\" the arrested students told investigators.Mr. Islam said the hardest part for the police was identifying the leaders, who were so concerned about security that they would not give their real names to the madrasa students they were training.Still, the police have now identified a trainer involved in planning the attack on Mr. Babu. Last month they printed the suspect\u2019s picture, along with those of five others accused of participating in the killings, in local dailies, offering rewards of up to 500,000 takas, about $6,400, for information leading to their arrests.Costly Slip-UpsThe other militant group, the reorganized Jama\u2019atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh, works independently of Ansar al-Islam and almost exclusively in northern Bangladesh, the chief investigator said. But the group is less professional than Ansar al-Islam, he said, making mistakes that are costing it public support.The group has trained 50 to 100 madrasa students as killers, he said, organizing them into cells of four or five. But through shoddy research, many of the victims have turned out to be popular local figures. Among them: a homeopathic doctor who used to give free treatment to villagers, and an English professor at Rajshahi University who was not known to have written critically of Islam.When detained militants learned that a 66-year-old Japanese man they had slaughtered had converted to Islam in 2015, they told investigators they were upset over their mistake.With all the slip-ups, the communities turned against them. With the public\u2019s support, Mr. Islam said, the police quickly rounded up the suspected hit men and several of their handlers in most of the Jama\u2019atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh killings, and were in pursuit of the senior leadership.Many in Bangladesh continue to live in terror. Twenty-five associates of one victim, a gay rights activist, have taken refuge in safe houses provided by diplomatic missions. Several dozen bloggers have fled the country. Those who remain have grown fatalistic.\"On this journey, we\u2019ll lose our lives,\" Arif Jebtik, 39, one of the leaders of the Shahbag movement, said in an interview in his Dhaka apartment, which he rarely leaves.

Ellis and his colleagues excavated about 20 shop fronts near one of the once-bustling gates of Pompeii known as the Portia Stabia. The latrines and cesspits behind the food sellers revealed charred food waste from the kitchens, as well as human waste, that dated as far back as the fourth century B.C., when Pompeii was still in an early stage of development. [Preserved Pompeii: Photos Reveal City in Ash]Along with grains, the waste revealed that the commoners of Pompeii ate a simple, but fairly varied, Mediterranean diet that included lentils, olives, nuts and fish, as well as the odd scrap of salted meat.More upscale restaurants could be distinguished by the wider array of delicacies they served.\"The material from the drains revealed a range and quantity of materials to suggest a rather clear socioeconomic distinction between the activities and consumption habits of each property, which were otherwise indistinguishable hospitality businesses,\" Ellis said.For instance, the drains at a more central property contained traces of imported foods such as shellfish, sea urchin and even a giraffe's leg.\"This is thought to be the only giraffe bone ever recorded from an archaeological excavation in Roman Italy,\" Ellis said. \"How part of the animal, butchered, came to be a kitchen scrap in a seemingly standard Pompeian restaurant not only speaks to long-distance trade in exotic and wild animals, but also something of the richness, variety and range of a nonelite diet.\"The team also found traces of exotic and imported spices that came from far-flung regions such as Indonesia.", "answers": {"answer_start": [37], "text": ["Pompeii"]}, "id": "419883576101187584"}, {"question": "These Two Young Ladies Looked So Innocent, Until Their Luggage Was Opened...", "context": "Social media has many wonderful uses, but perhaps our favorite use of social media is making our friends jealous of our fabulous lives.Perhaps that\u2019s what 22-year-old Melina Roberge and 28-year-old Isabelle Lagac\u00e9 were shooting for when they posted photos from their world, documenting stops in Bermuda, Chile, Ecuador, and New York. However, things took a weird turn when the girls took a luxury cruise from England to Australia. When the sea princesses took their final stop in Sydney, somebody was waiting for these fair maidens, but it was not Prince Charming...First SelfieThe two girls originally hail from Canada, and on their world travels, they took every possible opportunity to pose in bikinis, show beautiful sunsets, and take selfies like this one pictured here.

Turns out these girls were doing more than just traveling the globe. They were carrying much more than memories with them.Travel TherapyWhile the beautiful women were traversing the globe and setting their sights high, they were also involved in a huge drug ring. The ladies were carrying 35 kilos of cocaine in their bags. And that\u2019s not the worst of it...Collect Moments Not ThingsWhile the ladies were busy collecting moments and memories, 63-year-old Andr\u00e9 Tamine was planning on collecting the stash.

While brand extensions can be an effective way to incrementally increase revenues because they expand the business into new markets they were not already targeting, it only really works when they link naturally with the existing core brand.Harley's partnership with Ford for a limited-edition F-150 pickup truck was a smart blending of two American-made brands that complemented each other's strengths, even though it only ever made up 1% to 2% of Ford's F-150 sales. Harley's cake decorating kits, on the other hand, not so much.And it's not clear that a corporate blending of drinking and motorcycle riding leans more toward the pickup truck marketing venture than to being a Martha Stewart wannabe.Certainly, Harley-Davidson needs to do something to boost revenues. Its full year earning released a couple of weeks ago showed the big bike maker's sales were still in decline in the U.S., its biggest market, and profits were getting slashed. Revenues were down 2% in the fourth quarter and more than 4.5% across all of 2015, though part of that was due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rates.Yet it can't be denied lower sales here at home are hurting. U.S. motorcycle sales were down 4% for the quarter and almost 6% for the year. Finding other sources of revenue to supplement slumping bike sales will at least soften the blow.One smart way Harley is doing it is through clothing sales, specifically a new line of Harley-Davidson branded denim jeans through its Harley-Davidson MotorClothes Collection. That's the sort of brand extension that can work.The bike maker already sells almost $300 million worth of merchandise and apparel each year, and it was the one segment of its business last year that saw an increase in revenues (up more than 2%), currency exchange rates or not.Bikers already closely associate with the Harley brand, and wear everything from jackets and bandanas to shirts and gloves emblazoned with the H-D logo. And the reputed willingness of Harley enthusiasts to have the company's logo tattooed on their bodies is legendary. A brand of good quality jean, which is almost de rigeuer when riding anyway, is a natural way to branch out.A brew pub may not be. Cashing in on one of the hottest trends in alcohol makes sense. Craft beer is the one segment of the beer industry that is still generating broad appeal.According to the Brewers Association, the trade group representing the craft beer industry, there are over 4,100 breweries operating in the U.S. today, more than at any time in the country's history. Independent brewers also account for about 11% of all the beer brewed annually, and 19% of the industry's total market retail value.A business desiring to tap into that demand makes sense. Harley-Davidson doing so doesn't.The big motorcycle maker is reportedly taking over an abandoned 106,000 square foot Sam's Club store in Farmington Hills, Mich., with an idea to open a dealership that will serve as a destination location for the brand.In addition to selling motorcycles, which will occupy some two thirds of the space, Harley is also hoping to attract the previously mentioned brew pub as well as a gourmet market and maybe even a drive-in/ride-out movie theater. While Harley itself doesn't appear to be the one that will be running the bar, the association with drinking and riding shouldn't be one the bike maker wants associated with its brand.Recently rival Polaris Industries announced it would be making a limited edition Indian Motorcycle in honor of the 150th anniversary of Jack Daniel's whiskey. While that had some analysts scratching their heads over the decision, again because of linking drinking with motorcycle riding, it's being produced in very limited quantities and the proceeds from the auction of the very first bike produced in the run will be donated to a wounded veterans charity. It's still a relatively minor pairing of brands.Harley-Davidson's brand extensions here is once again an example of the bike maker running off the road in trying to juice sales. It may have looked at the demographics of the up-and-coming bike buyers, the urban, first time riders that include many women, and thought they'd be a natural fit for brew pubs and gourmet markets, but that's not likely the destination to where people are going to want to ride their Harleys.Its decision to get into jeans is a good fit, but having a dealership become a destination location to hangout is not likely. Though it's just one dealership at the moment, it represents the type of thinking that has gotten Harley-Davidson into the hole it currently finds itself in.The next billion-dollar iSecretThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

While it's interesting to imagine pressing a big red button and -- poof! -- the internet goes out around the world, it's actually much more complicated than that.It is possible, however, for people, companies and governments to turn off certain parts of the internet. There are countrywide blocks in places like Egypt and Gabon during political unrest, and temporary outages in India when the government turns off the internet while students take exams.Facebook (FB, Tech30) tracks these kinds of outages. Both internal monitoring and people on the ground contribute to this effort.Matt Perault, global head of policy at Facebook, started there in January 2011 -- around the time Egypt conducted widespread internet outages to quell protests. Over the next few years, he noticed that internet blocks were still happening with some frequency, just on a smaller scale.\"We felt they weren't getting the attention they deserved,\" Perault said during a panel at the SXSW Interactive festival on Friday. \"So we work with a bunch of organizations to try and bring attention to this issue.\"It's not just about losing access to Facebook. For instance, he referenced a recent Brookings report that found that temporary internet shutdowns cost $2.4 billion in 2015.You can think about the internet in three different layers: There's the actual infrastructure that powers the internet -- think cables and satellites. There's the protocol, which includes things like web hosts and providers, and then there are applications, like Facebook.Each of these layers have different responsibilities, as Perault and his fellow panelists explained, and countries or governments can target them differently. An internet service provider could stop serving a country, or a government could block specific services like Facebook or WhatsApp.In China, the \"great firewall\" blocks all kinds of content, including Facebook, Twitter, and the New York Times. In Gabon last year, nightly outages prevented people from connecting to any website.\"The problem is not the technology from a 'turn off the entire internet perspective,'\" Perault said. \"But the technology has gotten more advanced in creating methods to impose a less costly block.\"Facebook's internal group works with organizations like the Global Network Initiative to track these outages, and communicate them to a wider audience. Four out of five Facebook users are outside of the U.S., so many of them could be impacted by these blocks. For Facebook, figuring out where blocks happen is just good for business.Facebook said it is \"aware of at least 48 times in 2016 when access to Facebook, WhatsApp or Instagram was disrupted. This includes both targeted disruptions, as well those impacting the entire Internet.\"The company said one of the most significant outages that it's tracking right now is in certain regions of Cameroon, where it said internet connectivity has been down for 50 days.\"My main concern right now is moving to a world where there's increasingly sophisticated small-scale blocks,\" Perault said.", "answers": {"answer_start": [2566], "text": ["good for business"]}, "id": "841014683322703873"}, {"question": "Ariana Grande Actually Cut Her Hair \u2014 This Is Not A Drill", "context": "You guys.

He didn't realize that he was interrupting a FaceTime call with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Moreover, he didn't know that the phone was being held up to a CNN studio camera in Ankara and broadcast around the world.Firat's index finger could be seen awkwardly and repeatedly pressing her iPhone's menu button in the hope that Yilmaz's name would disappear from the screen.SEE ALSO: Periscope and Facebook Live help document attempted coup in TurkeyIn the background, the president\u2019s voice carried on, speaking from an undisclosed location somewhere in the Turkish resort town of Marmaris. Finally, flustered and confused, Firat jabbed her middle finger at the \u2018end call\u2019 button, sending the intelligence agency to voicemail.The president\u2019s address to his distraught nation in the midst of a surprise military coup could now continue without interruption.Erdogan\u2019s FaceTime call was bizarre, but revealing. It laid bare the calculus of a president whose support is heavily built on the ubiquity of his own face. The giant presidential portraits that have sprouted up on the country\u2019s major boulevards in the last two years are a testament to this.And now, sequestered in a dull, white room with no camera crews on hand, he desperately needed a way to show his face. So his staff pulled out an iPhone and opened FaceTime.About three hours earlier, shortly after the first tanks rolled into Istanbul and Ankara, there was a moment when it seemed that everyone knew what was coming.This is your first coup...Don't be worriedMilitary coups were a common feature in the Turkish experience of the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. Late Friday night into early Saturday morning, suburban parents called their children who were working or studying in the city to walk them through the process.Dogan, a 28-year-old engineer in Istanbul, told Mashable in an interview that his mother told him and his girlfriend not to panic.\"This is your first coup,\" Dogan's mother told them. \"We have been through many. So I just wanted to say, don\u2019t be worried, ok?\"Dogan requested that his last name be withheld due to the volatile political situation.Melis, a 26-year-old Turk living in New England, was terrified when she phoned home.Her parents reassured her by saying they already know the drill, she told Mashable. She also requested her last name be withheld for fear of repercussions for her family in Turkey.Activating VPNsAs families were coping with the unrest, reporters and activists were switching their conversations over to WhatsApp and activating VPNs.People chant slogans as they gather at a pro-government rally in central Istanbul's Taksim square, Saturday, July 16, 2016. Image: Emrah Gurel/APThis, too, was a strategy based on experience. Erdogan once described social media as a \"knife in the hand of a murderer,\" and common communications apps like Facebook Messenger and Twitter are routinely blocked by court order in Turkey at the slightest disturbance to national security.With such disturbances becoming more frequent and extreme, authorities have more recently done away with court orders altogether, choosing to \"throttle\" social media services by slowing them down unilaterally.This was particularly handy in last night\u2019s attempted coup, when court orders were in danger of becoming irrelevant. At 10:50 p.m., Dyn, an internet performance tracking service, reported that the throttling had begun. And then all assumptions were overturned.The throttling subsided, albeit inconsistently. Binali Yildirim, Turkey\u2019s prime minister and Erdogan\u2019s loyal ally, was tweeting furiously. The president was retweeting from his account, and he was also composing Facebook posts.When the president appeared on FaceTime, it became necessary for other politicians to also appear on FaceTime. Abdullah Gu\u0308l, a former president, was interviewed by CNN Tu\u0308rk on a 5-inch screen via FaceTime.Lawmakers scurrying around the parliament building in Ankara were calling into CNN Tu\u0308rk via FaceTime, with explosions being heard in the background.It was a phenomenon that echoed the American CNN\u2019s peculiar obsession with \u2018holograms\u2019 for one month during the 2008 presidential election, but this time fueled by Turkey's presidential personality cult and the abundance of unlimited 3G internet plans.Erdogan borrowed his enemy's tacticsErdogan\u2019s own aides, like the journalists and activists they so revile, were switching their conversations over to WhatsApp and reaching out to as much of the President\u2019s conservative base as they could.At around two o\u2019clock in the morning, Istanbul\u2019s thousands of minarets came to life. Imams issued calls on the loudspeaker for citizens to get out of their homes and show the military that they support their president.The calls were streamed and tweeted and the tides suddenly shifted. Outside, where soldiers were previously disarming police officers, police officers were now arresting soldiers.Pro-coup protesters were overwhelmed by pro-government protesters under the sonic boom of fighter jets zooming out of the urban airspace.The soldiers that instigated the coup had followed an old playbook, seizing media offices, shutting down bridges and airports, and trying to occupy physical territory.The President drew instead from the methods of the young, educated, urban elites who so frequently oppose him by focusing on a more virtual Turkey.With his back to the wall in Marmaris, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who condemned social media activists as knife-wielding murderers, decided to pick up the knife.", "answers": {"answer_start": [378], "text": ["FaceTime"]}, "id": "4t9gtp"}, {"question": "Here's what Nostradamus predicted about 2017", "context": "Michel de Nostredame, usually Latinised as Nostradamus, was a French physician and astrologer who lived in the 16th century.According to his followers, he predicted a lot of things that have actually happened in the last few centuries; including the French Revolution, Adolf Hitler\u2019s rise to power and 9/11.There is even evidence of him predicting Trump\u2019s presidential win, whom he referred to as \"the great shameless, audacious bawler\".His prophecies, which he wrote in four-line verse, are of course open to interpretation \u2013 but here are some verses that could possibly shed a little light on what we can expect in 2017: For forty years the rainbow will not be seen.For forty years it will be seen every day.The dry earth will grow more parched,and there will be great floods when it is seen.The great man will be struck down in the day by a thunderbolt.An evil deed, foretold by the bearer of a petition.According to the prediction another falls at night time.Conflict at Reims, London, and pestilence in Tuscany.Shortly before sun set, battle is engaged.A great nation is uncertain.Overcome, the sea port makes no answer,the bridge and the grave both in foreign places.Pestilences extinguished, the world becomes smaller,for a long time the lands will be inhabited peacefully.People will travel safely through the sky (over) land and seas:then wars will start up again.Letters are found in the queen's chests,no signature and no name of the author.The ruse will conceal the offers;so that they do not know who the lover is.A fox will be elected without speaking one word,appearing saintly in public living on barley bread,afterwards he will suddenly become a tyrantputting his foot on the throats of the greatest men.Twice put up and twice cast down,the East will also weaken the West.Its adversary after several battleschased by sea will fail at time of need.More: Nostradamus 'predicted' Donald Trump 400 years agoKeep scrolling for next article", "answers": {"answer_start": [348], "text": ["Trump\u2019s presidential win"]}, "id": "841986397464612868"}, {"question": "University eliminates abortion from health care coverage", "context": "Trustees at Loyola Marymount University have voted to eliminate health insurance coverage of elective abortions for faculty and staff.After weeks of divisive campus-wide debate, the board voted late Monday to end university-paid coverage in 2014, while providing an option for employees to seek out abortion coverage at their own expense.The controversial decision at LMU, a Catholic university in Los Angeles, has dissatisfied individuals on both sides of the issue.Anna Muraco, an associate professor of sociology at LMU, said that the debate was \"missing some of the larger issues that are at stake here -- issues like equity\" and diversity, the Daily Breeze reports.Abortion \"is legal and safe,\" she said. \"There\u2019s something disingenuous by the way this (issue) has been framed. ...

And while she navigates the new terrain of publishing, we're taking notes from her work titled, like her blog, Elements Of Style. The biggest takeaway: We pretty much want her life, and after a brief chat with her, we're certain of it.In the book you talk about your first blog post on April 3, 2007. Tell us what you were doing before that. What did your life and career path look like?Oh, a lot of things! I knew I wanted to do something creative and visual, but wasn't quite sure just what. I had worked in an art gallery, interned for a fashion designer, assisted another Boston interior designer and did event planning for a private school. I started my blog while at the private school job as a way to keep my creative fires stoked. And then finally one day, my husband gave me the courage to quit my job and focus on starting my own design company and growing the blog. My dad took a similar path -- he taught himself architectural design while working in the family business and then one day the design work trumped everything else, and he never looked back. So I grew up with a great role model to follow.The book title promises to show us how to design a home and a life. How are they similar?Homes are the palette on which we can illustrate our life stories. Every home should reflect your own journey, and not just look like everyone else's home. The process of moving around, growing up, figuring out what you want and then expressing that is true both in life and interior design. For me right now, I have this empty third bedroom just waiting to be a nursery, but I've been struggling to get pregnant. That room reflects my current life story, while the other rooms look pretty perfect.If you could pinpoint one moment that set you on this path, what would it be?Probably the day I realized that complete strangers were reading my blog, not just my mom and girlfriends. People were asking me for advice and I was thrilled to give it. That joyous feeling pointed me right to what I should be doing, which is both designing and writing!What's the biggest challenge staying the course?With design, it's stress. People think interior design is all rainbows and wallpaper and dollar bills. It's not. It's 75 percent paperwork and business planning, and 25 percent creativity. And the pressure to perform is intense -- you're spending other people's hard-earned money! You lose sleep hoping they are happy.What's one thing you do everyday without fail?Light delightful smelling candles and make my bed.

It may surprise you to hear that having an investment banker or firefighter title against your name, or even a CrossFit \u00adinstructor\u2019s, is no longer evidence yours is the most desirable \u00adprofession.According to the Harvard Business Review, the sexiest profession of the 21st century is tipped to be data scientist. We employ a lot of data scientists at REA Group, and while they have many great \u00adattributes, what makes them most irresistible is their ability to tell the future.Data scientists now hold the insight cards in their palms \u2014 not by reading planet alignments or palms or tea leaves, but by analysing and modelling the enormous amounts of data produced on our sites and combining it with other sources of information.If you\u2019d asked me 15 years ago if the sexiest profession would have included the words \"data\" and \"scientist\" in the title, I probably would have laughedIf I want to know the projected residential price increase of Hoxton Park, the types of housing preferred by first-home buyers, or the configuration of a residential apartment that will get the most interest, our team can pull the data, develop statistical models and tell me the answers. As someone who holds a fascination for \u00adfuture trends, it\u2019s hard not to be impressed.Recently, our data scientists have been looking at the probability of someone selling their home. Supply of housing, whether it is new dwellings or new listings, is often seen as simply a result of demand. Enough demand will push up prices and either prompt people to sell or allow developers to get a large enough margin to put up more housing.When listing a home, we know strong demand is not the only driver to sell, and a more complex analysis is required.The owner ultimately wants the best price possible, but other factors also \u00adfeature, including a mix of market drivers and personal drivers. These can include the demographic of the household, sales activity in the street the house is in, and the rental yield the house achieves or could achieve.By looking at these drivers in isolation, it is hard to determine a market trend, but give a data scientist a computer, loads of data and a modelling package and chances are they can work it out.Right now we\u2019re seeing high clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne, but this is not necessarily translating into new listings.Melbourne, in particular, had fewer auctions last week than it has had for a while, as owners of property appear to be holding off for a variety of reasons.While they have many great \u00adattributes, what makes them most irresistible is their ability to tell the futureThis could be because they \u00adbelieve they will get a better price in spring, or perhaps they are deciding to hold on to properties longer because they think there is still price growth in the market.In reality, the reasons are complex and show high variability across and within each capital city.If you\u2019d asked me 15 years ago if the sexiest profession would have included the words \"data\" and \"scientist\" in the title, I probably would have laughed.

A mold covered in glue is dipped into a machine, which constantly spins around, resulting in a skeleton of a million fiberglass threads. This skeleton is then coated in paint, and pressed between two 30,000-pound presses until it has a glossy, almost candy-like shell.It's a beautiful manufacturing process to watch, but because of the way the Eames Molded Shell Chair is finished, you never actually see the design of the skeleton underneath. The Carbon Fiber Eames Sofa, from architect and designer Matthew Strong, is an attempt to reveal that gorgeous inner structure. Woven together with threads of threads of ultra-strong, reinforced polymer, the Sofa shows off the Eames skeleton by stripping away the skin.Although the Eameses never designed a sofa in the style of their fiberglass shell armchairs, they did design prototypes sometime in the 1950s, which are still on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. Because of the amount of fiberglass needed to make the Eames Sofa sturdy enough to hold multiple sitters, Herman Miller ultimately decided not to manufacture the product. The finished sofa was just too heavy.But if the Eames had access to modern materials, such as carbon fiber, the Eames Sofa may well have become a reality. Which is what makes Matthew Strong's sculptural carbon fiber skeleton of the Eames Sofa such a fascinating project in its own right: looking at it is like peering into an alternate timeline of Eames-era design.", "answers": {"answer_start": [532], "text": ["Carbon Fiber Eames Sofa"]}, "id": "490679552482754560"}, {"question": "Another Oscar winner is making the move to TV", "context": "Halle Berry is coming to TV!

The indigenous subjects were not.\"Most photos were described as being native, native-type, half-breed, Eskimo, or simply ignored in the photographs,\" says Beth Greenhorn, who has been heading the project for the archives since 2003.\"Terminology has changed and, because we are dealing with historical records that were created decades ago, I find it a bit painful to go through.\"Updating the official record and terminology is one part of the project.The other is helping youth connect with their community elders to better understand their past.Ms Brewster says most of her family now knows the names of the children in the old images. Like family photos do, the images spurred a conversation about what their lives were like and where they were living.Among the stories they shared with their family were Betty Brewster's time as an interpreter-translator for the Nunavut land claims agreement that led to the creation of Canada's newest territory.\"When you talk about reconciliation and about moving forward as a country and as indigenous people, Inuit people living in this country, naming people in those historic photographs is so important,\" Ms Brewster says.\"When you acknowledge people have names, it lends more credence to their life experience.\"The project was inspired by Murray Angus, who oversaw a college programme for Inuit youth that brought them to the Canadian capital of Ottawa to study Inuit history, land claims, culture and language.In the early days of the project, the pictures were transferred onto CDs and brought north by the students to be shared at community gatherings and to visits to elders for identification.The project now uses social media outreach on Twitter and Facebook, where people can share the photos and offer clues.Ms Greenhorn says it gives her \"goosebumps\" when she sees someone recognise a family member or even a photograph of their much younger selves in the images.\"It is this very elemental human reaction that it just drives the project forward,\" she says.Images, now posted weekly, showcase the austere beauty of Canada's Arctic regions and its people, and glimpses into the past lives of ndigenous Canadians across what was a largely rural nation.They also portray some of the darker parts of Canada's relationship with its indigenous people, including photos of children in the residential school system, which removed them from their homes and aimed to eliminate their culture.The project is now entering its 15th year and has been expanded to include anonymous photographs from First Nations, Metis and Inuit people across Canada and all its northern territories.Since the project's launch in 2002, about 10,000 images have been digitised. More than 2,500 people, places, and activities they are participating in have been identified.Ms Greenhorn admits the number does not seem high but believes that each person named counts.\"Some of these portraits are so beautiful and they represent a life that was lived, someone that's contributed to their community that had a family and to not have a name for them is sad,\" she says.\"So when you do make a connection, when you get a name and add it to the record it's exciting and you think OK - there's one more done.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [116], "text": ["indigenous Canadians"]}, "id": "813203302963933184"}, {"question": "Drunk Girls On Spring Break Answer The One Question You\u2019ve All Been Wondering", "context": "It\u2019s an age-old question that is asked by the entirety of the male and female population across the world: does size matter?

Now, he\u2019s not \"fat\" by any means. In fact, his broad shoulders suggests that he balances his pizza intake with bench presses and curls. So how does this body occur and how do you undo a \"dadbod?\"The dadbod first came into light because some women actually found dadbod it hotter than the ultra-ripped ken doll look. Many people agreed, some disagreed, and the entire fitness world went into a tizzy. Basically, it was the black-dress-blue-dress of physique preference.But let\u2019s say you, the once-fit-and-now-aging fella, have found yourself with this particular body type and don\u2019t like it, and want to get a bit more in shape. What do you do? Rest easy: You actually have it easier than most.How Fitbods Turn Into DadbodsMany who gain weight over the years blame their metabolism. With dadbods, however, metabolism usually isn\u2019t the issue. We\u2019ve explained before that your resting metabolism (the amount of calories that you burn just living) accounts for 70% of total calories. On top of that, 85% of this number can be explained by fat free mass, or more simply how much muscle you have.Sure, metabolisms do decrease as people age, but only if there is an accompanied loss of muscle a condition known as sarcopenia, in which you lose muscle mass each year after the age of 50. The signature of a dadbod is that there is undoubtedly a good amount of muscle underneath the \"flab.\" So how do once-athletic bodies turn into dadbods?There are three possible explanations:You\u2019re burning fewer calories. Sure, we\u2019ve talked about the fact that exercise is probably not a great means for weight loss. However, if you were a former athlete for example (which many dadbod-wielding folks are) and keep your original caloric intake while no longer playing sports, weight will start to creep on.Sure, we\u2019ve talked about the fact that exercise is probably not a great means for weight loss. However, if you were a former athlete for example (which many dadbod-wielding folks are) and keep your original caloric intake while no longer playing sports, weight will start to creep on. You\u2019re taking in more calories (due to your environment). Let\u2019s face it. When many people get older and have more disposable income, that income gets spent on food. Social events too revolve around food, and there\u2019s a lot more imbibing that occurs.Let\u2019s face it. When many people get older and have more disposable income, that income gets spent on food. Social events too revolve around food, and there\u2019s a lot more imbibing that occurs. You started lifting and there\u2019s muscle under that flub. It\u2019s possible that someone at a higher BMI started a lifting regimen, made no change to diet, then developed more muscle. While it looks like they deteriorated into a \"dadbod,\" it might have actually been an upgrade over what some would call \"skinny fat.\"Basically, the dadbod has nothing to do with changes in metabolism, and everything to do with changes in life as you age.How to Reverse a DadbodThis part is easy. Dadbods have the ultimate advantage. They are men with a good amount of muscle tone, which means that they have a higher metabolism. Out of any single persona, the dadbod is physiologically the easiest when it comes to weight loss. If you have a dadbod and feel like weight loss is difficult, try being a 5\u20193 180-lb woman then get back to me.SponsoredReally, all dadbods have to do is use determine the number of calories they need every day to lose weight\u2014which will still be a lot\u2014whilst simultaneously keeping their protein high. Of course individuals may encounter particular difficulties. Perhaps mindfulness is an issue, for example, but I am being terse here for a reason. You have it easier than anyone else when it comes to losing weight.Obese individuals, those who can\u2019t even develop a dadbod, and pretty much all women have it dozens of times harder. Of course, perhaps you enjoy your dadbod and don\u2019t want to change it. That\u2019s okay too.

In a press conference last week, China announced that the space station would be falling back to earth at some point in late 2017.Normally, a decommissioned satellite or space station would be retired by forcing it to burn up in the atmosphere. This type of burn is controlled, and most satellite re-entries are scheduled to burn up over the ocean to avoid endangering people. However, it seems that China's space agency is not sure exactly when Tiangong-1 will re-enter the atmosphere, which implies that the station has been damaged somehow and China is no longer able to control it.This is important because it means Tiangong-1 won't be able to burn up in a controlled manner. All we know is it will burn up at some point in late 2017, but it is impossible to predict exactly when or where. This means that there is a chance debris from the falling spacecraft could strike a populated area.Fortunately, it's unlikely anyone will be injured.

According to The Wall Street Journal, docents are urging those in line for the \"Infinity Rooms\" to wait patiently inside the gallery, but away from the other 27 paintings on display in \"I Who Have Arrived in Heaven.\"\"We're not going to ask people to stand outside in the rain,\" said Hanna Schouwink, a gallery partner who worked on the exhibition. \"I hope it's not going to get too cold, because we'll be in trouble here.\"On the one hand, we strive to be champions of democratized art. In our opinion, the more accessible and available an art project, the better, so we're happy to see bustling crowds flock to Kusama's artworks. During a press preview for the exhibition, Kusama herself beseeched journalists and art admirers to bring as many eyes to her work as possible.\"I would like to work with you together to make that happen, to deliver the joy of the art and love and peace to people who are suffering and don\u2019t have the opportunity to enjoy the joy of the art,\" she stated.But on the other hand, it's difficult to consider the throngs of people waiting to ponder infinity, merely loitering around the dotted universe Kusama creates with her painted masterpieces. Her canvases show off a multitude of eyeballs, polka dots and lines exploding before your eyes in a flurry of neon colors; frenetic visions that Kusama rather ambitiously intends as purveyors of world peace, universal happiness and solidarity.If you're a longtime fan of Kusama's polka-dotted point of view, you'll want to head to Chelsea before Rain Room-esque madness descends upon us all. Paintings like \"Praying for Peace in the World\" and \"A Woman With Pink Hair\" are populated by new and ever-fantastical characters that evoke heightened levels of joy. The 84-year-old artist, on leave from the Japanese psychiatric hospital she calls home, has admitted that death is merely around the corner. But even the video piece, \"Manhattan Suicide Addict,\" a massive mirror-flanked moving image of the artist singing about her experience dealing with depression, seems to arouse feelings of pure resilience and encompassing love.", "answers": {"answer_start": [21], "text": ["Yayoi Kusama's New, Bespeckled 'Infinity Rooms'"]}, "id": "402584177335226368"}, {"question": "Evanna Lynch (aka Luna Lovegood) just discovered her patronus and she is NOT amused", "context": "Evanna Lynch (aka Luna Lovegood) just discovered her patronus and she is NOT amusedEvanna Lynch (aka Luna Lovegood) just discovered her patronus and she is NOT amused MoreUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you MUST be aware that Pottermore recently released a quiz to tell you what kind of patronus you would cast based on your personality.

By weekly painting one finger nail of their choice in any color they prefer, they are standing up for one in five children becoming victims to sexual abuse. The campaign quickly spread outside Australia where it initially started showing men everywhere displaying their willingness to make a change, and some great fashion sense too.The inspirationAside from presenting one in five children falling victim to abuse, there is another meaningful symbolism behind painting a finger nail. It started when Elliot Costello went to Cambodia as a part of Hagar International project for helping poverty-stricken regions. There he met a girl named Thea whom he soon became friends with. During one of their conversations, as she was painting his nails, he learned that she was victim of sexual abuse on daily basis while living in an orphanage. That was the moment that he decided to try to make a stop to this global issue. Inspired by her story and her favorite activity, he designed the campaign aimed to raise awareness and funds, provide recovery and care for victims, and ultimately, prevent child abuse.Polished up menThe Polished Man Project is focused toward aspiring men to polish up as great role models, great fathers, brothers and friends in order to build a better world where not a single child suffers abuse. As a slogan on The Polished Man website reads, it \"challenges men to nail it to end it.\" By taking action, men are re-writing the abuser role they most often have in cases of sexual assaults, and instead of perpetuating the horror by ignoring it, they are standing up for and giving voice to the quieted.Even though the campaign depicts only men, women are encouraged by the Polished Man Project to join men by supporting and praising them as \"positive masculinity\" role-models with a hashtag #ipreferapolishedman.According to the Polished Man Report for 2015, the movement helped raise $261,933.00 in USA only, making it a 60% fundraising growth on 2014.

Do This Instead.", "context": "Pots and pans wouldn\u2019t be much without the lids that come with them. It might seem like a silly thing, but it\u2019s much more difficult to boil water or even allow food to simmer without a lid to contain some of that heat. And an essential part of any pot or pan lid is the handle; this is the crucial piece that keeps you from getting burned by the steaming hot surface. So if your pots and pan lids are missing their handles, you\u2019ve just entered some potentially dangerous cooking territory. If your lids are broken like this, you\u2019d have to throw them away, right? Wrong! With this simple DIY, you can not only fix your lids, but you can also give them a stylish upgrade! It\u2019s a completely free project and it will make your pot and pan lids usable once more.You only need three simple materials to get a functional pot or pan lid! Most likely, you have all of them hanging around the house right now. If not, they\u2019re easy to get a hold of and relatively inexpensive (one item comes at a slightly higher cost, but it\u2019s one we think you\u2019ll be willing to pay.)Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to get started:MaterialsWine corkScrewdriverScrewWasherInstructionsPlace your cork on one of the empty holes on the top of your lid. Try to center it as best you can. Flip the lid over so it\u2019s balancing on the cork; feel free to grab the lid by the cork to keep pressure on it instead of balancing it. Put your washer around the hole and prep your screw. Take your screw and screwdriver and work the screw into the cork, continuing to apply pressure to the cork.By simply replacing your handle with a regular wine cork, you\u2019ve created a soft, heat-resistant new handle that looks stylish, too! Not only that, but it was most likely free to revive your lid \u2013 if you had to buy anything, it was probably a bottle of wine so you could scavenge the cork. We\u2019re willing to bet that you\u2019re not too upset with that investment.This DIY does depend a lot on HOW your lid handle broke. In some circumstances, you may have to remove lingering screws or even pieces of the broken handle from the lid. Naturally, those are steps that would take place before the outlined instructions above.But once all is said and done, you\u2019ll have a new handle that you can easily grab (even when your hands are wet) and won\u2019t burn you! Best of all, the DIY cork handle is also dishwasher-safe, so you don\u2019t have to clean your upgraded lids in some new, bizarre way.Your new cork handle is going to look so great, you might want to replace all your other boring lid handles with this hack!

She posted the video in celebration of Easter in 2012, which she referred to as her \"favorite holiday.\"\"No guilt in life, no fear in death,This is the power of Christ in me;From life\u2019s first cry to final breath,Jesus commands my destiny.No power of hell, no scheme of man,Can ever pluck me from His hand;Till He returns or calls me home,Here in the power of Christ I\u2019ll stand.\" \u2013 \"In Christ Alone\"When I learned the details of Christina Grimmie\u2019s faith in Jesus Christ, I knew she was in a much better place now.Grimmie was close friends with pop-star and Texas native, Selena Gomez, who made headlines after she broke down onstage the day after Grimmie\u2019s life was taken.Gomez\u2019s and Grimmie\u2019s relationship dates back to when both were teenagers, and Gomez\u2019s stepfather, Brian Teefey, became Grimmie\u2019s manager after discovering her on YouTube. Grimmie was also the opening act for Gomez on the North American portion of her 2011 tour.My heart is absolutely broken.

Although she\u2019s no longer a part of this lifetime, her legacy will continue teaching valuable life lessons for generations to come \u2014 and her performance of \"In Christ Alone\" is proof.Here\u2019s 3 Things We Learned From Christina Grimmie:#1: Time is money, spend it wisely...\"Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.\" \u2013 Ephesians 5:15-17Christina Grimmie may have only been 22-years-old when her life was taken, but she accomplished more in that short time than most adults ever will. The New Jersey native was considered a \"digital phenomena,\" with a YouTube following of more than 3 million subscribers worldwide \u2014 who she actively shared her faith in Jesus Christ with.In addition to Grimmie\u2019s charming personality, her advanced musicianship is what captivated the entertainment industry. Unlike most YouTube stars, Christina Grimmie re-composed every cover she performed.When she auditioned with a rendition of \"Wrecking Ball\" on Season 6 of The Voice, all four judges turned their chairs around and fought for the chance to work with her. She finished in 3rd place on \u2018Team Adam\u2019 and in 2011, she independently released her first EP titled \"Find Me,\" which debuted at number 2 on iTunes, behind Adele\u2019s \"19.\"Christina Grimmie made every second of her life count, and her untimely death illustrates the fragility of life. All we have is time and in an instant \u2014 you could be gone too.#2: Share your gift from God with the world...\"As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God\u2019s varied grace.\" \u2013 1 Peter 4:10Christina Grimmie\u2019s flawless voice was one of the most beautiful gifts we\u2019ve ever seen God bless anyone with \u2013 and I\u2019m so thankful she was brave enough to share it with the world at such a young age. Although we all have different gifts, we can all be inspired by Grimmie\u2019s courage to share her gift of music at such a young age.The judges from NBC\u2019s The Voice were vividly touched by Christina Grimmie, and it was her incredible singing that led them to her. Blake Shelton revealed he was \"stunned and disgusted and heartbroken that we lost that sweet little girl.\"Adam Levine made headlines when he offered to pay for her funeral. Levine revealed that he was \"absolutely devastated and heartbroken by Christina Grimmie\u2019s death\" and that \"Christina was a natural, a gifted talent that comes along so rarely. She was taken from us too soon.\"Whether you like it or not, we all have gifts God gave us to serve one another. Christina Grimmie\u2019s passion to share her faith in Jesus Christ through her impressive talent is a perfect example of sharing our gifts as devout stewards of God\u2019s diverse grace.#3: Death is nothing to fear...\"A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of death better than the day of birth.\" \u2013 Ecclesiastes 7:1Christina Grimmie\u2019s performance of \"In Christ Alone\" and the powerful lyrics to this hymn reveal the beauty of trusting in God\u2019s plan.

According to the law, HB2 or the \"bathroom bill,\" when you\u2019re in public building\u2014a government agency, a public school, whatever\u2014the gender listed on your birth certificate is the only one that matters. You remember the initial hubbub: North Carolina and the federal government suing each other, the boycotts and the hashtags and the Bruce Springsteen concerts cancelled.In spite of that, North Carolina\u2019s government hasn\u2019t repealed the law, and this week, the state lost high-profile sporting events, too, as the ACC and the NCAA pulled their championship games out of the state in protest. (If the NCAA is looking at you sideways, you know you\u2019re doing something shady.) But we\u2019re not here to talk about how the bill is bad and discriminatory. The DOJ made that call months ago. So did popular opinion, both nationwide and in North Carolina itself.Especially now that the NCAA and ACC joined in the boycott the loss of business represents a significant economic penalty for North Carolina. And it\u2019s North Carolinians, most of whom don\u2019t even support the legislation, who get stuck with the bill. So we decided to figure out how big a bill it is.Adding It All UpOne thing to note: You\u2019re never going to get an exact, cent-perfect total\u2014mainly because we\u2019re talking opportunity cost here. But here\u2019s what we do know.First, people are suing the crap out of these guys. North Carolina\u2019s Republican leadership racked up at least $176,000 in legal fees so far, $47,000 of which is just lawyers for the beleaguered Governor Pat McCrory. Why do those numbers matter? They are paid with tax dollars, and they\u2019re rising. In June, the North Carolina legislature approved diverting $500,000 from the disaster relief fund to Governor McCrory\u2019s offices for HB2 litigation. Sure, this HB2 situation\u2019s a disaster. But in a state that sees two, three hurricanes per year ... they might have done other things with that money\u2014especially as hurricane season gets underway.So it costs taxpayers money to fight lawsuits. How much does it cost them that businesses now see North Carolina as a bad investment? According to the think tank Center for American Progress, business boycotts and pullouts have cost North Carolina another $87.7 million. Charlotte has recently been a popular filming location, so when Lionsgate puts the kibosh on filming in North Carolina after HB2, just that led to three million dollars down the drain.North Carolinians lost $58.3 million when PayPal and an \"unnamed tech company\" canceled their planned expansions to the state. North Carolina has been vying the past few years for attention as the Silicon Valley of the South, but the loss of those jobs\u2014and the anti-HB2 amicus brief signed by 68 companies, including notable tech giants like Apple, Dropbox, Salesforce, Slack, SV Angel, Yelp, and Zynga\u2014 have put a damper on that campaign. \"There\u2019s a clear drumbeat here, and a bit of a snowball effect,\" says Laura Durso, senior director of the LGBT Research and Communications Project at the Center for American Progress. \"More and more companies are taking a look at their own values, and living those out.\"But by far the sector of North Carolina\u2019s economy most strapped by HB2 backlash is tourism. Leaving aside sports for a second, by the figuring of Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority, the Greater Raleigh Convention and Visitors Bureau, and the Greensboro Convention and Visitors Bureau, the state\u2019s three largest cities lost $109.4 million to canceled conferences and other events since HB2. That\u2019s things like the Bruce Springsteen concert, which probably contributed about $700,000 to that loss alone.But now we get to where it really hurts North Carolina most: sports. And here we\u2019re talking the total economic impact as opposed to direct spending. That includes the ticket sales and hotel rooms, but also the cost to the florist down the street who would have done arrangements for a post-game reception. When the NBA pulled their All-Star Game, North Carolina missed out on $106 million. When the NCAA and ACC followed suit with their championship games, it means a loss of at least another $91.4, $51 million from the NCAA events and $40.4 million from the ACC\u2019s.While it might sound frivolous in comparison to losing, say, 400 highly skilled PayPal jobs with an estimated total salary of $20 million, college basketball abandoning North Carolina is hitting the state in its heart. \"It obviously a loss for our grand basketball tradition,\" says Chris Sgro, executive director of LGBTQ rights organization Equality North Carolina and a member of the state\u2019s General Assembly. \"In many of our cities, we\u2019ll have a sporting event drought for years to come if we don\u2019t repeal HB2.\" As one North Carolinian put it: \"college sports is religion in North Carolina.\" And for now it\u2019s gone.The Grand TotalAdding all that up, the total cost to North Carolinians so far from HB2 protests is slightly more than $395 million. That\u2019s more than the GDP of Micronesia. And the bulk of it is from sporting organizations, who even five years ago would likely not have waded into political territory like this.

Over the course of its run, the show won legions of die-hard fans, not to mention four consecutive Emmy awards for outstanding drama series.The show's stars \u2014 Bradley Whitford (\"Josh Lyman\"), Richard Schiff (\"Toby Ziegler\"), Dule\u0301 Hill (\"Charlie Young\"), Joshua Malina (\"Will Bailey\"), Janel Maloney (\"Donna Moss\"), Melissa Fitzgerald (\"Carol Fitzpatrick\"), along with creator and executive producer Aaron Sorkin \u2014 recently sat down with TODAY at the ATX Television Festival in Austin, Texas. Cast members Martin Sheen, Allison Janney and Rob Lowe were unable to attend.Here are 7 things we learned from these White House \"staffers\":1. Shows about politics can workWhile a drama set in the halls of the White House might seem commonplace these days (\"Scandal,\" \"House of Cards\" and \"Veep\"), \"The West Wing\" was a trendsetter. When the show debuted in 1999, Whitford acknowledges that \"it was very in the air that political shows don't work.\" \"The West Wing\" would go on to prove otherwise, for seven seasons.NBC The cast of \"The West Wing,\" pictured left to right: Richard Schiff as Toby Ziegler, Dule Hill as Charlie Young, Allison Janney as Claudia Jean 'C.J.' Cregg, John Spencer as Leo McGarry, Martin Sheen as President Josiah 'Jed' Bartlet, Rob Lowe as Sam Seaborn, Janel Moloney as Donna Moss, Bradley Whitford as Josh Lyman.2. Who would President Bartlet endorse this year?Donald Trump? Hillary Clinton? Bernie Sanders? Who would President Bartlet endorse in the wild and crazy world of the 2016 presidential election?While Bartlet portrayer Martin Sheen was unable to make it to the reunion, the cast shared their opinions on the 2016 political race. Assessing the match-up, Sorkin alluded to his own concerns about Donald Trump and declared that, if he were a real person, President Bartlet \"would endorse Hillary Clinton.\"Who would President Bartlet endorse in 2016 race? Aaron Sorkin weighs in:https://t.co/0rZsutlgEv \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) June 22, 20163. The best way to get cast on 'The West Wing'? Save the executive producer's lifeActor Joshua Malina joined the program in season four as speechwriter Will Bailey. But his connection to Aaron Sorkin goes back a few decades, when Malina appeared in the Broadway production of Sorkin's \"A Few Good Men.\" One fateful night, Malina and Sorkin were bowling with the cast when Sorkin choked on a hamburger. Malina sprung to action, giving him the Heimlich. Sorkin acknowledges that Malina \"really did save my life,\" and perhaps not coincidentally, Malina went to appear in almost everything Sorkin has ever written (\"A Few Good Men,\" \"The American President\" and \"Sports Night\").4. Josh and Donna should have gotten together a lot soonerThe relationship between Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman (Whitford) and his assistant Donna Moss (Moloney) may have been one of the slowest-burning romances in TV history. The two flirted for years, before finally locking lips in season seven. What took so long? Moloney reveals she never wanted the two to get together for fears that once the sexual tension was broken, her character would be phased out.Sorkin takes the blame in this instance, citing his own concerns that nothing interesting would happen if the two got together. The executive producer told TODAY that if he had to do it over again, he would've \"let them have a relationship.\"5. The Broadway phenomenon 'Hamilton' owes a debt to 'The West Wing'Who is the biggest \"West Wing\" fan of all? According to the cast, it's none other than \"Hamilton\" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. The cast revealed that when they went backstage at the Tony Award-winning show, Miranda mentioned how the program inspired \"Hamilton.\"Miranda and his fellow \"Hamilton\" castmates even showed their love for the TV drama with a \"West Wing\"-inspired walk and talk when they paid a visit to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue earlier this year.6. Aaron Sorkin has never seen the later seasons of 'The West Wing'Aaron Sorkin created the program but left after season four to pursue other opportunities. The show soldiered on in Sorkin's absence for 3 more years, with new characters, dramatic plot lines, and a presidential election. But what did Sorkin think of the show's later seasons? The truth is, he never even watched.\"Seinfeld\" co-creator Larry David (who left his own show midway through its run) advised him: \"You can't ever watch the show again \u2014 because you're gonna watch it and either it's going to be great and you're gonna be miserable, or it's gonna be less than great and you're gonna be miserable. But either way, you're gonna be miserable.\" Sorkin took David's advice and admits that watching those later seasons would have felt like \"watching somebody make out with my wife.\"7.

According to the site AfterCredits.com, the answer is no. There is no extra scene either during or after the credits.At first, even critics weren\u2019t sure if the movie would have an extra scene. A rough cut of the movie that showed for critics at the South by Southwest festival earlier this year didn\u2019t have any credits at all, Variety noted.

Over four episodes, we saw these two enlist the help of the Jedi -- specifically Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Ahsoka Tano -- to free their planet from the Separatists. Many may remember the episodes solely because of the love triangle between Steela, Lux Bonteri, and Ahsoka. However, Saw made an impression on viewers because of his persistence and drive.Saw Gerrera made an impression on Clone Wars viewers because of his persistence and drive. Share on FacebookShare to TwitterMy main memory of Saw isn't necessarily a good one. During the third episode of the arc, the reigning king of Saw's home planet, Onderon, plans to kill his predecessor whom he usurped for control of the planet. Steela proposes a reasonable plan to free the prior king at his execution but Saw doesn't agree. He believes they need to infiltrate the prison and break the ex-king free. The entire team disagrees. Saw doesn't care and heads out to the prison.Unbeknownst to Saw, he's entered the trap he feared would be set during the execution. He becomes a prisoner and is tortured in an attempt to learn where his comrades are hiding. He withholds the information and insults Onderon's general, telling him it's his fault that the Separatists have taken the planet. Saw is then taken to view the execution.At the execution, the rebels intend to free Saw and the ex-king but are thwarted by the Separatists. Ahsoka begins to press forward and seems to be preparing to strike, however, the general beats her to the punch. He frees Saw and the ex-king and they all flee to the mountains.Image Credits: LucasfilmWhat This Means for Saw Gerrera in Rogue OneSaw was willing to risk everything he and his team had fought for to free the imprisoned king. Though he cares for his friends and family, his rebellious attitude is strong enough to outweigh his sentimentality. This makes him dangerously impulsive.Saw also believed his plan was the correct one despite the view of everyone else. His pride moved him to follow his own path instead of trusting his allies. Because of his inability to give in and show humility, he was imprisoned and nearly executed. He's very clearly rebellious; when Saw wanted his planet freed, he got up and made it happen. He was ready to fight whoever -- and whatever -- got in his way. Saw's rebellious attitude is part of what kept his friends going in the darkest of times. He kept the embers of discontent burning within them.In Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Saw Gerrera inspires loyalty. Share on FacebookShare to TwitterLastly, he inspires loyalty. Saw helped convince the Jedi to help the rebels. He even convinced the general to take his men and turn against the crown. Saw is able to help people overcome their fear of others. He made the perfect rebel leader because of his ability to draw people into the cause.Because of all of this, Saw is the perfect character to feature in Rogue One. Like Jyn Erso says in the trailer, he too rebels. He will most likely be a Hulk-like character; not in strength but in purpose. The Rebellion's leaders will have to decide if unleashing the hero is worth bringing forth the consequences.Considering how the Onderon arc ends in The Clone Wars, Saw may be entirely reckless and constantly looking for vengeance and fights when we catch up with him 25 years later in Rogue One. On the other hand, the consequences of the rebellion on Onderon may have made him wary of fighting and rebelling altogether.Saw and Steela. Image Credit: LucasfilmI can't truthfully say what Saw will be like in Rogue One. We do know his past though, and we know what he's been through. Hopefully Rogue One will address what happened to Saw all of those years ago and the toll it took on him.Either way, we're all happy to have Saw back in the Star Wars Universe.

Although California became the first state to legalize cannabis for medicinal use in 1996, the state has yet to establish a set of standards guiding the cultivation, production and sale of the plant, which has led to what Ammiano described to The Huffington Post as \"chaos.\"\"I am optimistic that we can continue to work with all parties to finally create regulation that will satisfy all needs,\" Ammiano said in a statement Friday, \"from federal law enforcement down to the very sick patients who depend on the health benefits only marijuana can provide.\"California currently leaves it up to local governments to decide how they want to implement the state's medical marijuana law. As a result, some cities, like San Francisco and Oakland, have established clear-cut systems that dictate where dispensaries can operate and impose fees that directly enrich their coffers. Other places, like San Diego and San Jose, remain largely unregulated, with very little control over where pot-related businesses can operate. San Jose lawmakers are currently mulling legislation that would effectively make it impossible for medical marijuana providers to exist.\"Marijuana has never been regulated by the state as any other business,\" Ammiano told HuffPost last year after introducing similar legislation. \"Cities and counties don't know what to do or what they can do. Police are unsure how to respond.\"AB 1894 would create a division within California's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to regulate all medical marijuana-related entities throughout the state, from the farmers that cultivate the plant to the storefronts that sell it. The proposal would allow the agency to impose fees on marijuana businesses in order to raise revenue for the state, and local municipalities would also be allowed to impose additional taxes.\"Without regulation, there's no way to capture any of the income that could go toward our infrastructure or other worthy causes,\" Ammiano told HuffPost last month.California's lack of statewide regulations over its pot program has left it vulnerable to federal interference, as the drug is still classified as a Schedule 1 substance (along with heroin and LSD) in the eyes of the national government. In 2011, a coalition of U.S. attorneys launched an aggressive crackdown on medical marijuana operations throughout the state under the guise that the industry had spiraled out of control. Since then, hundreds of businesses related to the drug have closed, and thousands of people have lost their jobs. Last month, the Drug Enforcement Administration raided several dispensaries in Los Angeles, and a pot shop in Mendocino, closed by federal authorities earlier this year, only recently reopened.By contrast, the Obama administration has been less combative in states with more comprehensive regulations. Colorado, for example, has faced fewer DEA raids and has been allowed to implement its groundbreaking recreational, adult-use law largely in peace. Late last year, Attorney General Eric Holder indicated that the federal government would not intervene in states that had \"strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems.\"\"While statewide regulations won't change federal law, it does seem to be the case that states that have uniform, clear regulations are less likely to be interfered with by the feds,\" Tom Angell, the head of weed advocacy group Marijuana Majority, told HuffPost last mont. \"It's very confusing in California right now: a patchwork of regulations city to city and county to county.\"Ammiano has made many attempts to create statewide medical marijuana regulations over the past few years, but each piece of legislation stalled or was defeated by opponents who argued the measures didn't address key issues like the environmental implications of growing cannabis or the criteria for doctors to make recommendations to patients. He's confident his current bill addresses every concern and more.\"I'm cautiously optimistic,\" he told HuffPost last month. \"People have seen that the more regulation you have, the less chaos you have.\"Meanwhile, marijuana reform advocates believe a measure like Ammiano's is the key to paving the way for a law that would allow recreational use by adults in the state. Recent polls have suggested a majority of Californians support legalizing pot for recreational purposes, and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has joined an effort to place a legalization initiative on the 2016 ballot.But first, \"we need to show that California has the ability to regulate marijuana,\" Angell said. \"This would help further demonstrate how tax revenue can be generated and put into needed programs.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [35], "text": ["California"]}, "id": "470294261963845632"}, {"question": "Brother Agrees To Babysit His Sister's Boyfriend's Kid, Later Discovers Sister Left Out One Tiny Detail", "context": "A Washington state couple was shocked after they found out they had been babysitting a kidnapped child.John Tuong originally ended up babysitting the boy after his sister asked him to watch her boyfriend\u2019s son.

The substance of choice hails from the exotic tropics. It\u2019s said to impart a brain-boosting rush and tons of energy, enough to transform its users into raging Energizer bunnies. This drug can be ingested, drunk and even snorted. You\u2019re probably familiar with its common name: cacao.Say, um, \"hi\" to the sweetest party drug there is. In recent months, cacao has transcended its already lofty status as a superfood and vaulted into the realm of party drugs. In this latest incarnation, cacao powder is taking the place of alcohol and illicit substances like Molly and ecstasy in parts of Western Europe. Lucid, a monthly cacao-fueled dance party in Berlin, fixes bitter Balinese cacao into partygoers\u2019 drinks. Morning Gloryville, a rise-and-shine rave company that organizes dance parties from London to New York, stocks its bar with cacao drinks and cacao pills. And in perhaps the strangest form, Belgian chocolatier Dominique Persoone invented a special $50 snorting device so you can huff your chocolate in powdered form, much like cocaine.Never mind that this is the same raw powder you can find at the corner Vitamin Shoppe or processed in your favorite candy bar \u2014 or that cacao is perfectly legal in all the jurisdictions we found. Proponents say that raw, virgin cacao is far more potent than you ever imagined. First comes a surge of endorphins into your bloodstream, which increases acuity and fuels you with feelings of euphoria. Then there\u2019s the flood of magnesium, which relaxes your muscles and de-tenses your body. Raw cacao is also chock-full of flavanols that increase blood circulation and stimulate brain power, according to a recent study from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.And, of course, cacao can be downright delicious. Lucid\u2019s pixie-like party organizer, Ruby May, isn\u2019t a purist when it comes to the stuff: She spikes the 18 pounds of cacao per party with sweet hints of honey, agave syrup and cinnamon, and the celebrations go on for six hours. \"It\u2019s like a smooth, sensual hug in a cup,\" says the 36-year old. And as far as the sniffing chocolate goes, Persoone mixes the powder with ginger, raspberry and mint for his patrons in Belgium. Chili pepper was tried, he says, but was \"not a good idea.\" Color us surprised.To be clear, cacao is not going to distort your reality. Under the beats of house, hip-hop, funk and electronic music, cacao \"amplifies\" the experience, rather than dims it with alcohol or drugs, says May. In fact, she doesn\u2019t allow booze inside. The mood-boosting effects of cacao are \"subtle,\" she says, and it\u2019s not like tripping on acid. Even pure cacao is not actually a drug. While it does contain certain mood-enhancing compounds such as anandamide and phenylethylamine, the bitter reality is that the amount is much too low to have any direct influence on mood, says Dr. Catherine Kwik-Uribe, the director of research and development for Mars Symbioscience, a scientific division of Mars, Incorporated. Which is to say that all of this alleged chocoholism is probably a placebo effect.If it sounds like G-rated fun, well, it is; these are parties where virtue handily wins over vice.All of these concoctions come courtesy of the \"conscious dance movement,\" which evolved from an underground movement into morning raves and lunchtime dance parties, often attended by millennial office workers. It seeks to create a positive \u2014 and healthy \u2014 environment, in which participants can unhinge themselves from negative thoughts and social inhibitions. Alcohol is usually a no-no, as are illegal drugs. Self-actualization, communal bonding and calorie-burning are key. If it sounds like G-rated fun, well, it is; these are parties where virtue handily wins over vice. (Indeed, a kindergartner\u2019s birthday party, with ice cream and cake, hits more deadly sins than this.)But such events have found an audience. One of Lucid\u2019s attendees was 51-year-old Re\u0301ka Koma\u0301romi, an ethnobotanist based in Canterbury. She says the raves help her to overcome the sorrow of her daughter\u2019s untimely cancer \u2014 to \"get rid of the sadness\" and \"allow me to access my anger.\" Now that she\u2019s fully steeped into this scene, she can\u2019t get enough of cacao or its mellowing effects, especially for such \"psychologically hard\" times in her life.The use of cacao was pioneered in millennia past by Mesoamerican civilizations. As early as 1900 B.C., archaeologists believe, the Mokaya people in what is now Mexico were fermenting cacao beans into liquid chocolate. The Aztecs, it seems, valued cacao so highly they would trade the beans as a form of currency. Today, the very ethically conscious may have a beef with chocolate, protesting that appropriating cacao from its Mexican origins for Eurotrash-like dance parties rings a wee bit colonial.Skepticism aside, cacao can act as a \"catalyst for having more life,\" says May, rather than \"numbing ourselves with beer.\" And \"in all my years in research, I have never seen a person not smile when enjoying a piece of chocolate,\" adds Kwik-Uribe. Admittedly, she has a vested interest \u2014 but on the other hand, we can\u2019t imagine a party that can\u2019t be improved by chocolate.", "answers": {"answer_start": [613], "text": ["cacao powder"]}, "id": "4kwx9i"}, {"question": "[St. Louis] Cardinals player killed in car accident", "context": "Oscar Taveras, an outfielder for the St. Louis Cardinals, died in a car accident, USA Today reported.

And that capers are pickled flower buds . But coming across what figs really are \u2015 and the wasp that makes them possible \u2015 has just made us question every truth we know in this world.Because fig flowers bloom internally, they need a special process for pollination. They cannot rely on the wind or bees to spread their pollen \u2015 that\u2019s where the fig wasp comes in. The fig cannot survive without the fig wasp to spread its genetic material, and the fig wasp cannot live without the fig, because that\u2019s where it lays its larva \u2015 this relationship is known as mutualism.In simple terms, figs are technically not a fruit \u2015 they are inverted flowers. Fig trees don\u2019t flower like apples and peaches. Their flowers bloominsidethe pear-shaped pod, which later matures into the fruit we eat. Each flower then produces a single, one-seeded, hard-shelled fruit calledachene\u2015 that\u2019s what gives the fig the crunch we know \u2015 and the fig is made up of multiple achene. So when we eat a fig we are actually eating multiple fruitsThe female fig wasp enters the male fig \u2015 we don\u2019t eat the male figs, by the way \u2015 to lay its eggs. The male fig is shaped in a way to accommodate the laying of wasp eggs. The female wasp\u2019s wings and antennae break off when entering the small passage in the fig so once it\u2019s in, there is no way out. It\u2019s up to the baby wasps to continue the life cycle. Male baby wasps are born without wings, because their sole purpose is to mate with the female offspring \u2015 technically their sister \u2015 and dig a tunnel out of the fig. It\u2019s the female offspring that make the journey out, bringing pollen with them.If a fig wasp enters a female fig accidentally \u2015 the ones we eat \u2015 instead of a male one, there is no room in the interior for it to reproduce. And it cannot escape, because its wings and antennae have broken off. So the wasp dies inside, which is unfortunate but necessary because that\u2019s how it delivers the pollen giving us the fruit we love.Don\u2019t worry, this doesn\u2019t mean the crunch in the fig is a wasp carcass. The fig uses an enzyme known as ficin to break down the wasp into protein, though it doesn\u2019t always break down the entire exoskeleton. So, yes, technically when you bite into a fig you are in fact eating fig wasps \u2015 or what once was a fig wasp \u2015 but you can at least console yourself with the fact that they\u2019re incredibly small.

She assumed that the piercing abdominal pains might be a legacy of her trip or, more likely, the consequence of bad sushi she had consumed before the party.As the pain worsened, Dickson remembers wondering, \"Is this what childbirth is like?\" The next morning she saw her family doctor in New Jersey, who sent her to the hospital for tests. Soon afterward, the symptoms disappeared, and when testing revealed nothing, Dickson said she \"moved on.\"Six months later, she experienced a second episode, followed by another a year later. The third attack would end far differently than the first two: Doctors at a New Jersey hospital decided that, based on the results of her CT scan, Dickson needed emergency surgery.[Doctors dismissed his pain as migraines. Then they said he had 24 hours to live.]Johanna Dickson thought her excruciating stomach pains were caused by food poisoning at first. It soon became clear the issue was more serious, but Dickson's eventual diagnosis shocked both her and her doctors. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)\"Something like this is very strange in a 24-year-old,\" said Kenneth A. Goldman, the surgeon who operated on Dickson in August 2008. Goldman said he approached her case with some trepidation, \"hoping for the best and assuming the worst.\"For Dickson, who now works as a book publicist in Manhattan, the first episode was a surprise. She had felt fine on vacation and been generally healthy during the previous year she had spent in South Africa on a college study program. Because she had worked with orphans who had HIV, Dickson underwent testing for infectious diseases after she returned to the United States from her year abroad. \"I assumed if there was anything serious, I\u2019d find out about it,\" she recalled.The second attack, which caused stabbing pain so intense it woke her from sleep, passed fairly quickly; this time, she didn\u2019t go to the doctor.But the pain during the third episode was much worse. Dickson, who was then living with her parents near Princeton, said that it began in the middle of the night and grew so unbearable that she began screaming. Her mother held her and tried to soothe her; in the morning, her parents rushed her to the doctor\u2019s office.He decided that Dickson probably had food poisoning \u2014 she had bought fruit from a street vendor the previous day. Although her pain, which was mostly on her left side, seemed somewhat lessened, the doctor told Dickson\u2019s parents that if it didn\u2019t subside by noon, she should go to the hospital for an abdominal CT scan. One possibility was acute appendicitis, although that typically causes pain on the right side.[He couldn\u2019t eat, drink or work. And doctors couldn\u2019t explain his searing pain.]Dickson was little better by noon, and her parents took her to the hospital. Several hours later, an ER doctor entered the room and asked a series of rapid-fire questions. \"He wanted to know if I\u2019d ever given birth, or had surgery or had a family history of colon problems,\" Dickson recalled.1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The case files: Medical mysteries View Photos From a daily afternoon fever to a debilitating reaction to chemotherapy, here\u2019s a look at perplexing medical mystery cases.

He had swollen thumbs, bleeding gums and anemia. He cried whenever anyone touched his legs. Doctors were running out of time. Read the case Cam Cottrill/For The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.The answer to each question was no.\"Why?\" Dickson remembers her father inquiring.The doctor explained that the CT scan showed that Dickson\u2019s pain was the result of a serious bowel obstruction. The most likely cause at her age was scar tissue from previous surgery. Another possibility was an inflammation of her colon. Because Dickson had never had any surgery \u2014 she had never been in a hospital \u2014 and no history of colon problems, doctors had no idea what was causing the obstruction. A surgeon was on his way to see her and would decide whether she needed an operation or whether the problem might resolve without it.[A simple test proved that a teen with stomach pain wasn\u2019t a hypochondriac after all]A bowel obstruction occurs when the large or small intestine is partially or totally blocked, preventing food, fluids and gas from passing normally. It typically causes severe pain that may wax and wane.Through a morphine haze, Dickson remembers feeling terrified about the prospect of surgery. Goldman told Dickson and her parents that surgery was essential. \"I remember hearing something about my intestine being really badly tangled and that it was something you [usually] see in people over 60.\"The primary concern was that the obstruction was cutting off the blood supply to Dickson\u2019s colon; an operation to untwist the intestine and relieve the obstruction was the only treatment. Causes of a blockage include a hernia; Crohn\u2019s disease, a disorder that causes inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract; previous abdominal surgery, including a Caesarean section, which results in the formation of scar tissue; and a tumor.Goldman remembers wondering what he would find. \"I\u2019ve seen 25-year-olds with metastatic colon cancer,\" he said.Shortly before 7 p.m., Dickson was wheeled into surgery.A surprising discoveryIn the operating room, Goldman discovered the source of the obstruction: a tumor the size of a plum in Dickson\u2019s small intestine. He sent samples of the tumor \u2014 called frozen sections \u2014 to the pa\u00adthol\u00adogy lab and waited for the initial report.[She couldn\u2019t stop coughing. Were fragrances to blame?]The pathologist found that the specimen contained abnormally shaped spindle cells \u2014 round in the middle with pointed ends. Because such a finding is rare and its implications unclear, Dickson\u2019s pa\u00adthol\u00adogy samples were subsequently sent to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for a second opinion. In the meantime, Goldman decided that in case Dickson did have an invasive cancer, he needed to remove enough of her intestine \u2014 about 10 inches \u2014 to ensure that no malignancy remained. Dickson said she suffered no ill effects from the surgery.The next morning, Dickson recalled, Goldman explained that the first two episodes had probably been caused by the bowel partially twisting around the tumor and then untwisting. Once the tumor grew too large, surgery was essential.The Mayo pathologists classified the tumor as an extremely fibrous growth called a desmoid, a slow-growing mass that typically affects women younger than 40.Because the tumor was attached to the mesentery, the fold of tissue that connects the small intestine to the abdominal wall, the condition is also called mesenteric fibromatosis. About 900 desmoid tumors are diagnosed annually in the United States.There is disagreement about whether such tumors should be classified as benign \u2014 largely because they do not spread \u2014 or as a low-grade form of cancer. Dickson said she was told her tumor was benign.Surgery to remove desmoid tumors is the preferred treatment, but recurrence is common. Many desmoid tumors, which can develop anywhere in the body, have no known cause. Some occur in people with Gardner syndrome, a type of familial adenomatous polyposis, a genetic disorder that results in frequent colon polyps in adolescence and in early-onset colon cancer.[Why I hid my daughter\u2019s medical diagnosis from her for as long as I could]No recurrenceBut in Dickson\u2019s case, no genetic link could be found.Dickson said she underwent frequent monitoring the year after her surgery as well as a colonoscopy, which found nothing. She sees an oncologist periodically for follow-up, but so far the tumor has not recurred.In 2013, five years after the surgery, Dickson underwent a second abdominal operation, which involved removal of more of her intestine, to relieve pain caused by scar tissue from the 2008 operation.\"I thought, \u2018Oh, my God, am I going to be doing this every five years?\u2019 \" she remembered wondering. There is no way to prevent a recurrence \u2014 doctors don\u2019t know what caused the tumor \u2014 but Dickson said she is careful about her diet, avoiding fried foods and dried fruit, which she has trouble digesting.These days stomachaches always get her attention.\"If Pepto [Bismol] doesn\u2019t work after about 20 minutes,\" she said, \"I do get a little nervous.\"To Goldman, Dickson remains a singular event in his long surgical career. \"I\u2019ve seen one case of this in my 32 years,\" he said. \"That was Johanna.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [5718], "text": ["tumor the size of a plum"]}, "id": "1100188040002123_1106125166075077"}, {"question": "@LadyGaga slams the magazine that put her on the cover", "context": "Lady Gaga may dress however she pleases in real life, but even she isn't immune to the clever hand of Photoshop on her magazine photos.At Glamour's 2013 Women of the Year Awards on Monday, the December Glamour cover girl accepted her award with a sharp critique of her own recent Glamour photos.

The male fish use them to try to mate, while the females only grunt in response. The unusual sound has been likened to \"an orchestra full of mournful, rasping oboes,\" according to the San Francisco Gate in 2004.Researchers from Cornell University believe they have finally discovered what causes the strange melody: melatonin. Melatonin, a hormone naturally produced by plants and animals, is released at night, the Washington Post reports.In animals \u2013 like humans \u2013 that sleep a night, melatonin is believed to control the internal body clock, telling the rest of the body that it\u2019s tie to sleep.

In February, Jackson was hit with a 4.0 as well. In the last five years, according to USGS data, there was only one other earthquake within roughly the same distance with a magnitude of 4.0 or higher. (Note: Yellowstone National Park reports that the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem actually saw five alone in 2010.)So, we spoke with the Wyoming Geological Survey to find out if activity has gotten crazier. The answer is: no, no it hasn't. If anything, Yellowstone's significant seismic activity decreased significantly over the last 60 years.Wyoming Geological Survey's Division Manager of Groundwater and Geologic Hazards and Mapping, Seth Wittke, says that those quakes were likely caused by geologic features unrelated to the Yellowstone caldera. Wittke said anything outside of a 10-mile radius from the park boundary is likely unconnected.In 1959, a 7.3-7.5 magnitude earthquake hit Hebgen Lake in Yellowstone, which spurred significant aftershocks for the next few decades. In the 1960s, Wittke said there were 32 earthquakes that measured over 4.0 within the 10-mile radius of the park. There 37 more in the 1970s, but then it dropped to 12 in the 1980s. And in the last 26 years, there have only been five over 4.0.The following information was provided by Yellowstone National Park Geoscientist intern Jacob Thacker: \"Indeed, earthquake activity in Yellowstone is very commonplace and it is one of the more seismically active areas in the United States. That is not always cause for worry, and it is actually a good thing, as it keeps the \"plumbing system\" clear for many of the thermal features. However, as you guessed, the geysers and other thermal features are very dynamic and in constant change. This is perhaps best observed at Mammoth Hot Springs. We have also received reports of some interesting activity at Norris Geyser Basin this year, which we will continue to monitor to gain more understanding. \" That stated, we monitor the thermal features here in a number of ways. For example, we monitor eruption intervals by placing temperature sensors in runoff channels of prominent geysers throughout the park, and we use thermal infrared imagery from satellites and airplanes to look at annual changes in various thermal basins. Our interpretive rangers, who are in their respective geyser basins daily, are also a great resource for passing along any new and unusual activity. In addition, there are a number of citizen science volunteers who monitor geyser activity within the major geyser basins of the park, and we keep in close contact with USGS and University of Utah scientists who specialize in everything from volcanic gases to earthquakes. Interesting changes certainly happen all the time, but this is pretty much the name of the game here in Yellowstone, and part of the excitement. \"M agnitude 4.0 earthquakes have been fairly common since 1980 and that there really is no cause for concern.\"#reboot #buckrail #county10 #springcity #dally #oilcity #county17 #shortgo #newsAcross the internet, people are always talking about the massive caldera beneath Yellowstone and hypothesizing about when it is going to blow up and take more than half the continent with it.", "answers": {"answer_start": [758], "text": ["no it hasn't"]}, "id": "4p7y54"}, {"question": "Neil deGrasse Tyson names the genius who blows *his* mind.", "context": "Even our heroes have heroes, and in this video, Neil deGrasse Tyson waxes rhapsodic about a man who blows his mind.

Other studies have shown sleep helps the body solidify muscle memory, too -- and actually boost athletic performance.Just last week, Andre Iguodala of the Golden State Warriors said there was a direct relationship between the quality of his sleep and his performance on the court. The NBA All-Star was speaking to students at Stanford University with Huffington Post Media Group's Editor-in-Chief Arianna Huffington.

If all else fails, quietly engage your mind: Read, listen to music or practice meditation -- and take solace in the fact that a little anxiety is completely normal. (But if insomnia or anxiety is starting to affect your day-to-day life, consider seeking help from a professional, Orma said.)Unfortunately for Day, the golfer ended up losing his number one ranking and falling out of the top finishers at RBC Heritage.

They then asked the participants how often they had sex and how many partners they've had.Men who reported more altruistic acts had more sex \u2014 and more partners. For those who were in relationships, good-hearted men were more likely to have had more sex in the last 30 days, too.mangostock/ShutterstockIn the second experiment of the study, the researchers had undergraduate students say whether they would like to donate money that they might receive for participating to charity. Those who said that they would also tended to have more casual sex, more sex in relationships, and more lifetime sex partners overall.Another study, published in January 2016 in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, presented 202 women with different men to choose from. The different combinations of choices were either attractive or not, and they either did a good deed or didn't.The women chose the selfish, attractive men for a one-night stand. But for a long-term relationship, they chose the altruistic man whether he was attractive or not.A slightly older study, published in The Journal of Social Psychology in 2013, really drives this home. That study found that women valued altruism above other traits as a measure of whether a potential mate would make a good parent. The women also said that altruism was important for short-term relationships, but significantly more women said that the trait mattered for the long term.Yet another study, published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in July 2015, analyzed Germans' responses to a large annual survey.Single people who reported doing good deeds were much more likely to say that they were in a relationship the next year. They also took less time to find a partner than their non-altruistic peers.All of this is not to say that other traits don't matter. Humor is also important to women selecting a mate, researchers have found. It makes women assume that a man is more intelligent.A sense of humor is a good indicator of sexual activity, too. In one study, men whom women rated as funnier reported having more sex with more partners.For building long-term relationships, though, researchers find over and over again that altruism is a crucial and highly desirable trait.Psychologists have yet to pit humor head-to-head against altruism. It's also important to keep in mind that many of these studies are small, and that people often behave differently in real life than they do in a lab setting, or when responding to a survey. Especially when reporting positive experiences like charity work or sex, men may be more likely to overestimate how much they actually do those things.And because of the way that these kinds of studies are designed, they can't say conclusively that it's altruism specifically that's attractive. It might be other traits associated with altruism, or that men attractive for other reasons might also happen to be altruistic.But the large number of studies and the consistent findings in favor of altruism are building a pretty solid case that there are some side benefits to doing good deeds.

This is what happens with hiring minority writers as well. When you\u2019re doing my job, you have to hire the best writers, period. However, when you do find someone that\u2019s really talented that\u2019s a woman or some kind of minority, then it\u2019s thrilling to plant your flag and say, \"This is my person.\" Oddly enough, on \"Masters of Sex,\" three of our episodes were directed by women, our staff was half women, my producing partner is a woman. A lot of the people that have interviewed us say, \"Wow, this whole show is run by women.\" We look at each other and think, \"We didn\u2019t design it that way.\" And that\u2019s actually pretty great.Ashford with \"Masters of Sex\" co-executive producer Sarah Timberman.Do you have a work persona and a non-work persona?I\u2019m in charge of a lot of people, so when I go to work, I feel the responsibility to be bit of a cheerleader and to keep everything on track so it\u2019s a very extroverted personality that needs to show up and do my job. But the truth is at heart I\u2019m a writer, and that is an incredibly introverted sort of character. I think I\u2019m an introvert that has to act like an extrovert a lot.Are you close friends with anyone you work with or have worked with in the past?Yes, very close. Everyone I\u2019ve ever been with romantically, I met through work. Some of my very, very best friends I met through work. One of the nice things about being on television shows is you are thrown in with people in such an intimate and time-intensive way that you get to know them really well.Did you meet your husband, Greg Walker, working on a show?I was his boss actually, although I was very well behaved. I had a previous husband, and I met him through work.And you have kids?I have two kids, 9 and 11. It was a lucky coincidence that I happened to pick a career -- or a career picked me -- that was actually conducive to having children. Had I been a lawyer, I don\u2019t know how I would have done it. The thing about writing is I could write at home. I never stopped working when I had kids at all.Ashford with husband Greg Walker and sons Ben and Sam before the Emmys.Have you ever been in the situation where the big meeting at work coincided with the school play or something else involving your kids?Yes. I decide to go with whatever involves my kids. I work with a lot of people who have kids, and they get it. And I have not found anybody saying, \"This is a dealbreaker.\" So I just stick with that.What\u2019s the distribution of work like in your household?I\u2019m much more in charge of everything that goes on in our household, although he\u2019ll make lunches or he\u2019ll take the kids to school if I can\u2019t. I still think that women do much more of that than men. Luckily, my husband is a great cook. In terms of cleaning up the mess, it\u2019s always me.Ashford with her family in the costume department of \"Masters of Sex.\"Did your mother work?My mother died about five years ago. When I was growing up, she was a stay-at-home mom. She was a good cook, and she helped us with homework and took us to our music lessons, and she was very present. When we went to college, she got a job working at the Claremont colleges in development.Did she understand why you work the way you do?I think my mother was secretly very pleased that I worked and slightly envious. My mother was very smart, an incredible reader, and I think there was a part of her that thought, \"The fact that all I\u2019ve done is just raise children is not entirely satisfying.\" She was really happy that she raised three kids, but I think part of her felt a little bit restless.Tell me about an average workday vs. a great workday.An average workday is one with a million distractions. I\u2019m running around and forget to eat and look up and go, \"Oh my god, it\u2019s 5:30 already and this day is not even two-thirds over.\" That\u2019s sort of an average day, which is not bad, but feels exhausting and fragmented. A great day for me is a really good writing day, which is just being quiet in my office and getting a lot done and feeling really pleased by what I\u2019ve written.Ashford with \"The Pacific\" co-producer Robert Schenkkan at the 2011 Writers Guild Awards.When was the most recent time you thought about quitting your job?Oh, I think about quitting it all the time. I do love writing, but writing is different from engaging in the business part of what we do. I get very fatigued with what the marketplace is saying is good material and what is not. I have this fantasy that someday I\u2019ll never have to read Deadline again.Do you keep your phone next to your bed?No. I detest my cell phone and forget it about half the day. I understand the need for cell phones, but I think they\u2019re pernicious and I think the idea of being glued to your phone is awful. I still have a landline and I will keep it till the day that I die.Is your to-do list electronic or paper?Paper. I still have an address book that\u2019s handwritten. I don\u2019t even have people\u2019s contacts in my computer. That\u2019s how prehistoric I am.The writers' room of \"Masters of Sex. Each card represents a scene.Do you get enough sleep?No, but it\u2019s not because I\u2019m staying up so late. The problem is I have a lot on my mind, and I find that I wake up. So I have a little secret life in the middle of the night, where I sometimes read or just think about what I\u2019m working on. Many times I\u2019ve gotten up and worked. I try not to do that too much because sometimes if you get going, then you\u2019ve been up since 3. I find actually the thinking in the middle of the night can be incredibly helpful for what you have to do the next day. I\u2019ve actually solved a lot of story problems, so while it\u2019s annoying, maybe it happens to me for a reason.Do you get enough exercise?I try to at least get to a gym twice a week. I try to go for a walk other times. I don\u2019t get enough exercise, but I don\u2019t see how I can fit any more in than I already am.Are you paid what you\u2019re worth?That\u2019s a very tricky question because people in the entertainment business tend to be paid a lot, and if you compare what I do to a woman exactly my age who is teaching in a public school and trying her damnedest to give kids the best shot at a good life, no, I\u2019m overpaid. She should be taking some of my money. But it is what the market will bear, and so I don\u2019t send my checks back and I\u2019m grateful for them. And when you\u2019re in the thick of it, you think, \"My god, they should double my salary.\" But in the bigger picture, I think people in entertainment and sports are overpaid.What would you title your autobiography?\"She Tried.\"Is there a woman you know of who is Making It Work?

And you know that the day after Halloween is one of the most disruptive days of the year!But did you know that many food and candy companies use unnecessary ingredients that can trigger hyperactivity, adding additional stress to families already coping with ADHD?Petroleum-based artificial food dyes are found in everything from cereal, yogurt, and granola bars to candy, chips, and even children's medicines! Numerous scientific studies have demonstrated that dyes can cause hyperactivity in sensitive children. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration acknowledges that. But the FDA has refused to ban dyes or even require a warning notice on labels, as the European Union does for most dyes.Ahead of October 31 this year, the Center for Science in the Public Interest is working with the Shutters family from Jamestown, N.Y. to publicize renewed attention to the link between artificial dyes and hyperactivity in kids, get the word out to families affected by ADHD, and encourage companies to stop coloring foods with these harmful dyes.Renee Shutters is a member of the Feingold Association, a group that promotes the use of an elimination diet to treat hyperactivity and other symptoms in children, focusing especially on the removal of artificial food dyes from the diet. Her son Trenton, age 9, used to exhibit hyperactive behavior and had difficulty focusing at school and cooperating at hockey practice. After two days on the Feingold diet Trenton's behavior improved dramatically, according to Ms. Shutters.\"Before he started the Feingold diet, Trenton was easily distracted at school and hockey practice. He was angry and disruptive and had trouble sitting through dinner or falling asleep at night,\" said Shutters. \"We decided to remove artificial dyes from his diet, and after two days of eating that way, his attitude and behavior improved greatly. Now, he brings light into the classroom and makes everybody laugh. Trenton excels in academics and sports, and he couldn't have done it without this diet.\"Thousands of families have discovered that getting dyes out of their kids' diets improves the way the kids feel and behave. Their experiences are backed up by scientific research. A 2004 meta-analysis affirmed that artificial dyes increase hyperactivity. The United Kingdom's Food Standards Agency has urged food companies remove dyes from their products based on two studies that it commissioned (on top of all the earlier evidence) that found that mixtures of dyes adversely affect the behavior of ordinary kids (not only kids thought to be sensitive). The European Union then required foods that contain any of the dyes used in those two British studies to bear a warning label. Those dyes include Red 40, Yellow 5, and Yellow 6 -- the three most widely-used dyes in the United States and Canada. Partly as a result of that action, very few foods in Europe contain the dyes and bear the warning notice.Mars is one of many companies that use natural colorings in products they market in Europe but artificial dyes to color the same products in the United States. M&M's candies contain mostly natural dyes in Europe, but feature Red 40, Yellow 5 and 6, and Blue 1 and 2 in the United States version.We have launched a petition on Change.org to ask Mars to color M&M's, the best-selling candy in the country, with only natural colorings in all markets. Don't North American consumers don't deserve the same health protection? Please join our effort if you agree Mars should get these neurotoxic chemicals out of M&M's.And parents, please think twice before sending the neighborhood kids home with candy colored with artificial food dyes this Halloween. While most candies are junk, treats colored with artificial dyes can impact children in a much more serious way than naturally-colored treats. Passing out M&M's (and other foods with dyes) may result in temper tantrums in your neighbors' homes and meltdowns the next day at school.When your own little witch or superhero comes home on Halloween with a bag full of sugar and artificial food dyes, here are some great tips from the Feingold Association to limit the damage.", "answers": {"answer_start": [33], "text": ["Neurotoxic Artificial Food Dyes"]}, "id": "392745222901207040"}, {"question": "A #NeverTrump Republican just gave Trump a memorable new nickname", "context": "Veteran Republican consultant Rick Wilson has been at the vanguard of the #NeverTrump movement.

Over time, more companies began adopting Buckingham and Coffman's prescribed approach, and now companies like Facebook operate entirely on their philosophy. Facebook HR chief Lori Goler recommends their book to all new managersIn their book, Buckingham and Coffman define talent as \"a recurring pattern of thought, feeling, or behavior that can be productively applied.\"They say there are three types of talent to consider:Striving talents: \"They explain why he gets out of bed every day, why he is motivated to push and push just that little bit harder.\"\"They explain why he gets out of bed every day, why he is motivated to push and push just that little bit harder.\" Thinking talents: \"They explain how he thinks, how he weighs up alternatives, how he comes to his decisions.\"\"They explain how he thinks, how he weighs up alternatives, how he comes to his decisions.\" Relating talents: \"They explain whom he trusts, whom he builds relationships with, whom he confronts, and whom he ignores.\"It is up to the manager to determine a talents profile for the position they are looking to fill.It's important, Buckingham told us , that this profile doesn't become a checklist that guides the job interview. The worst thing a manager can do in an interview, he said, is ask too many follow-up questions in an attempt to find the answer they're looking for.\"Every time you ask a question you give something away,\" he said. \"You don't want to give anything away.\"Buckingham explained that the interviewer should be looking for frequent behaviors, and if the candidate is a great fit, they will naturally reveal these behaviors without prodding.", "answers": {"answer_start": [532], "text": ["talent"]}, "id": "52ip8e"}, {"question": "New Galaxy Note 6 Leak Uncovers A Disturbing Missing Feature", "context": "Would Samsung hobble its key hardware release by offering it with an older operating system. Would it be ready to accept the headaches of trying to force an update through the various carrier certification processes? In other words, will the cutting edge Galaxy Note 6 release with last year's version of Android?That's the intriguing prospect raised by SamMobile's look at the user-agent profiles showing up around the web from the next phablet from South Korea. The expectation is that Samsung would be the first commercial vendor to release a device with Android N - the seventh major version of Google's operating system - which would sit nicely with the new technology that is being crammed into the chassis to take on the might of the iPhone.Instead the user agent profile notes the SM-N930A is running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow.It's also worth noting that the serial number suggests that this is a flat screened version of this year's note, and not the curved screen version that is reminiscent of the Galaxy S6 Edge and S7 Edge. Given that Samsung has been testing multiple version of the phablet that's not as much of a surprise as expected. At some point Samsung will have to decide which model to go with (or to run a dual model strategy).Asked about the choice of operating system for the Galaxy Note, Samsung declined to comment. Whatever choice is made on the physical hardware, the decision to go with an older version of Android is a curious one.Android N has only recently been made available and no matter how much testing is done in-house by Google and Samsung, there can be no substitute for a public debut and hundreds of thousands of users stressing the OS in the hours after launch. The chances of the code needing an immediate patch will be high, and that means trying to roll out an over-the-air change while under some pressure. And the Android ecosystem has historically had many issues in achieving timely updates.There's a certain level of pragmatism in going with Android Marshmallow for the Galaxy Note 6 launch. The phablet is a key 2016 device launch for Samsung and will boost interest in the overall Galaxy brand after the S7 and S7 Edge release in the spring. With Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus expected to launch three to four weeks after the Note, the last thing the South Korean company needs is a problem with the software coming to light just as Tim Cook takes to the stage.With so much new hardware going into the Note (I'm expecting the curved screen on some devices, dual-lens camera and the return of microSD to name three notable areas), going with Marshmallow is a safer option. Marshmallow is a known quantity, it has been tested by millions of users for the last year, and Samsung's software engineers will understand intimately how it works. A switch to Android N throws away those comfort factors.Yet moving forwards with Android N feels like the right thing to do. The Samsung Galaxy 6 (or perhaps the Note 7, the jury is out on the name) is packed with new features, innovative design, and screams 'progress!'. To have those hardware advancements backed up by the latest software techniques in Android N will present a united front and a statement that the Galaxy Note is the future of smartphones.It's harder to make that statement if Samsung uses Marshmallow and then organises a piecemeal roll-out of Android N at some point in the future. Now is not the time to play safe, now is the time to be aggressive and redefine the smartphone market on Samsung's terms while the competition is weak.Samsung should not be playing it safe with the Galaxy Note 6.", "answers": {"answer_start": [905], "text": ["flat screened"]}, "id": "4n94ra"}, {"question": "These universities are happy and they know it", "context": "Good luck finding a college with happier employees than those at Auburn University in Alabama.Auburn was ranked the happiest university to work for in 2013 by CareerBliss, a jobs website.CareerBliss scored universities with a maximum of five points based on responses from more than 70,000 independent company reviews from 2012-2013.

Well Arsenio ain\u2019t taking too kindly to Sinead\u2019s Facebook rant, so he did what any sane person would do- he lawyered up and shot back at the \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" singer with a lawsuit that\u2019s large enough to buy everybody in Sinead\u2019s native country of Ireland one small value meal from a fast food joint...ARSENIO DROPS BIG $$$ LAWSUIT ON SINEAD O'CONNORARSENIO DROPS BIG $$$ LAWSUIT ON SINEAD O'CONNOR Arsenio just slapped Sinead O'Connor with $5MILLION lawsuit over her Prince rant and claims that Aresenio supplied the legendary Purple One with drugs that ultimately caused his death. I betcha next time she'll think twice before letting her typing fingers take off with a mind of their own on Facebook, LOL. Check out the details on the lawsuit: via TMZ: 'Arsenio Hall just clapped back at Sinead O'Connor with a $5 MILLION defamation lawsuit over her claim he was fueling Prince's habit.His lawyers, Marty Singer and Lynda Goldman, filed the suit Thursday morning, in which Arsenio calls Sinead a \"desperate attention-seeker\" for posting an incendiary rant on Facebook earlier this week. She called Prince a \"longtime hard drug user\" who got his supply from \"Arsenio Hall (AKA Prince's and Eddie Murphy's bitch).\" In the suit, Arsenio flat out denies ever supplying Prince with illegal drugs -- and adds, he hasn't had contact with Sinead for 25 years. He also denies spiking her with drugs back in the day ... as she claimed.As for why she targeted him -- Arsenio says she's repeatedly said she met Prince a couple times and she \"detested\" him. She also says she told Prince \"to go f*** himself.\" Arsenio implies this is par for the course with Sinead, saying she is \"well known for her media antics and for seeking attention through inflammatory Facebook posts.\"'", "answers": {"answer_start": [916], "text": ["$5MILLION"]}, "id": "4jm73v"}, {"question": "Why @PassionPit canceled those concerts", "context": "Passion Pit has once again had to cancel shows, a decision that the band explained in a lengthy and intense open letter posted to the band's website on Tuesday.Frontman Michael Angelakos and his bandmates posited three main reasons for cancellations: general illness, mental illness and weather. Angelakos suffers from bipolar disorder and has dealt with serious depression and survived suicide attempts in the past, but he writes now that \"this only hurt us a few times, and it was well over a year ago.\"There are many reasons bands or artists cancel shows. Here are a few of them, many of them have applied to us: 1) General Illness. Though many bands play through illness, sometimes it\u2019s absolutely necessary to take a night off to ensure that the rest of the tour survives instead of beating your body up only to have to risk canceling more shows in the future. This is how so many singers lose their voices, or people develop long-term illnesses. It\u2019s just not worth it. 2) Mental illness. Most of our fans know about my condition but this only hurt us a few times, and it was well over a year ago, and I work my ass of to make sure I can get out on stage and tour. More on how we made up all of these shows later. 3) Weather. Outdoor stages that are built into muddy grounds have caused death (so many examples of this). Rain and electronics, as we all know, also really don\u2019t mix. Sometimes, other stationary stages are said to be \"rain or shine\" but do not actually have the capability of fully protecting the gear. As some of you may know, we lost SO much gear and money a few weekends ago due to a storm, and we\u2019re not about to mess it up on our final trek for \"Gossamer.\" That could potentially end an entire tour and then that\u2019d be it. No more touring. See you maybe in 2014. Not fun.The band stresses that they wouldn't have canceled shows if they had any other choice, but that DJ'ing in place of performing during inclement weather didn't really work out for them (they were heckled), and their equipment is too customized and expensive to risk damaging it like they did earlier this year.\"Please understand that if Passion Pit cancels a show, it\u2019s canceling a show for a damn serious reason, and we\u2019re not messing around with our fans,\" Angelakos writes. \"We\u2019re trying our hardest and we are so sorry for the inconvenience. There\u2019s only so much we can do.\"In asking fans to think before getting upset, Angelakos reminded them who really suffers when a concert is canceled:We lose the most. We lose the trust of our fans because of innocent naivete\u0301, an ignorance in regards to how these things are done. WE lose the trust of those who don\u2019t understand how many people are involved in our show, from our touring crew to local crew, how much planning goes on for months and months to prep, how much money is spent to keep the tour rolling, and how much we need to tour to make sure we can afford to put on the show we want to do and still end up being able to pay our bills and continue to do this for a living.For the full letter, head over to the band's website.

But new research suggests that many new parents make at least one mistake before they even pull out of the driveway.More than 90 percent of new parents at one Oregon Hospital made at least one key error in installing their newborn's car seat or in positioning the newborn in the seat, according to new research to be presented Monday at the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference.\"As someone who has been doing this for a number of years, I've always been struck by how difficult it can be for parents to adequately protect their children,\" study researcher Dr. Benjamin Hoffman, a professor of pediatrics at Doernbecher Children\u2019s Hospital at Oregon Health & Science University and a certified car passenger safety technician, told The Huffington Post.To conduct the study, Hoffman and his team observed 267 sets of babies and caregivers who were discharged from Doernbecher's mother-baby unit between fall 2013 and spring 2014. (For the purposes of the study, the caregiver was either the newborn's parent or an adult designated by the parent.) As the families prepared to leave, safety technicians watched them install the car seat in their vehicle and place the baby in the seat, in order to screen for what the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has deemed \"critical misuses.\"On average, researchers found 4.2 misuses per family. Ninety percent of the families made two or more errors, while 50 percent made five or more.Caregivers were more likely to make mistakes positioning their newborns in the car seat, rather than installing the seat itself. Sixty-eight percent did not sufficiently tighten the harness, while 33 percent placed the harness retainer clip too low. Other errors included using the wrong harness slot, not knowing how to adjust the harness at all and using a non-regulated product in conjunction with the car seat.When it came to setting up the seat, the most common error was installing the seat too loosely, a mistake 43 percent of families made. Other common errors included angling the car seat incorrectly, using a seat belt but not locking it, and putting incorrect spacing between the car seat and the vehicle's front seat.\"We collaborated with parents to correct any misuses before they left the hospital ... and parents were incredibly grateful to know they were traveling home as safely as possible,\" Hoffman said. \"Everyone was very well-intentioned in this process, but many families were very surprised to find out how many errors they made.\"Hoffman noted that the study's findings were in line with a broader 2004 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which found that 84 percent of rear-facing car seats had at least one critical misuse.Notably, the researchers found that families were 13 times more likely to correctly position their babies and car seats if they had arranged a visit with a certified car passenger safety technician, or CPST, before heading to the hospital.\"I always recommend that parents go to seatcheck.org to find a CPST in their area if they don't know one already, because they will help guide them through whatever they need to know,\" said Jamie Grayson, owner of BabyGuyGearGuide.com and a certified CPST himself. Many smaller retailers have a dedicated technician on staff, he added, who can help parents work through installation issues before they buy a car seat.\"Read your manual,\" Grayson urged. \"Both your car seat manual and your car manual.\" He also recommended that new parents bring their car seat into the hospital room with them and practice positioning their baby in it before they head out to the parking lot.Hoffman said that he would like to see hospitals provide car seat technicians who can work with families upon discharge, and hopes that car seat manufacturers will continue to innovate and engineer car seats that are more intuitive for parents to install and use.\"This study suggests that newborns, and families of newborns, are more vulnerable than the general public and we need to think differently about how we can help them and provide resources,\" Hoffman said.The true impact of the errors measured in the new study is impossible to quantify, Hoffman said.

the first to establish a link between traffic and pre-eclampsia - adds to growing concerns about the health impact of air and noise pollution.Earlier this week a separate study published in the Lancet medical journal warned people who live near roads are also at significantly higher risk of developing dementia.Those concerns add to established evidence that traffic fumes increase the risk of heart disease and asthma.NHS watchdog NICE last month called for urgent action to tackle the problem, warning that air pollution contributes towards 25,000 deaths a year in England - almost 5 per cent of all deaths.Despite overwhelming evidence of health inpacts, the UK has struggled to control air pollution, with 37 cities across Britain persistently breaching legal limits of air toxins set by the EU.Pre-eclampsia affects around 6 per cent of pregnancies in the UK - and in severe cases can lead to stillbirth or maternal death.The new results may help to explain why until recently rates of preeclampsia have been increasing in many countries.It could also provide some clues about the underlying causes of pre-eclampsia.Researchers found that for every 10-decibel increase in noise from traffic \u2013 roughly a doubling in audible volume - there was a 10 per cent increase in the risk of pre-eclampsia and high blood pressure problems in pregnant women.Similarly, for every 0.01 micrograms of nitric dioxide from car exhausts in a litre of air - a tiny increase - the risk of the condition rose by 7 per cent.Study leader Professor Marie Pedersen, of the University of Copenhagen, said: \u2018The rise in risk we saw is significant in terms of impact on a population level, as a 10-unit increase in pollution and noise is very small.\u2019Pre-eclampsia usually occurs in the second half of pregnancy and can lead to problems with the flow of blood through the placenta.Warning signs include high blood pressure, swelling in their feet, face and hands, severe headaches, vision problems and pain below the ribs.As the delivery of nutrients can be hampered by the problems with the placenta, it can restrict the growth of the unborn baby.There is currently no cure for the condition and often babies need to be delivered early to prevent it from worsening.Pre-eclampsia and hypertensive disorders are among the leading causes of maternal death and stillbirth.Around 500 babies are thought to die in the UK each year as a result of the condition.Those at the highest risk include women who are obese, have high blood pressure before they are pregnant, those suffer from diabetes or have a family history of preeclampsia.Professor Pedersen said her study shines new light on the root causes of the condition, which has been poorly understand in the past.She said: \u2018Air pollution causes inflammation and oxidative stress, which has been linked to damage to blood vessels, immune system changes and elevated blood pressure.\u2018Noise may induce stress and disturb sleep, which has also been associated with similar changes.\u2018We observed the strongest effects for mild pre-eclampsia and early-onset of pre-eclamsia.\u2019She and her colleagues, whose work is published in the journal Epidemiology, studied data collected from 72,745 pregnancies in Denmark and modelled the noise and air pollution at their addresses.They found women living in areas where road traffic was heaviest in their first three months of pregnancy had the highest risk of developing pre-eclampsia, when all other factors had been controlled for.Even when they tried to separate noise from air pollution they found both seemed to have an impact on the condition.Mothers living close to busy airports, where the noise of aircraft continually taking off and landing can be heard, and train routes also have an increased risk.Professor Pederson said: \u2018If our findings are true, they could have public health implications given the large burden associated with these outcomes and the fact that exposure to both air pollution and noise are difficult to avoid in modern society.\u2018We expect that the findings from our study and other studies add support to policies that aim to reduce exposure to air pollution and noise.\u2019Professor James Walker of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said: \u2018This research into traffic noise is interesting and warrants further investigation \u2013 especially as there is increasing evidence on the impact of increased air pollution from cars on poor health.\u2018While the exact cause of pre-eclampsia is unknown, it is important to reassure women that there are likely to be a variety of contributory factors that lead to a diagnosis \u2013 probably to do with the placenta - rather than just exposure to traffic noise.'", "answers": {"answer_start": [87], "text": ["risk to pre-eclampsia"]}, "id": "818125365377925122"}, {"question": "Here's how you can get a $10,000 gold Apple Watch for just $349:", "context": "Much has been made about the $10,000 gold Apple Watch Edition, and how unattainable it is for most of us.

But during the casting process for the movie, it had been a close race. Krasinski later said he even did an audition in full costume, according to Screenrant. In the end, the role of Captain America went to Evans who, of course, went on to become a household name for his portrayal of the superhero, earning millions and millions of dollars for each Avengers film. Today, he has an estimated net worth of $50 million. John Krasinski wasn\u2019t mad he lost out on playing Captain America to Chris EvansNearly a decade later with all the Avengers movies complete, Krasinski hasn\u2019t stopped teasing his fellow actor for nabbing the role of Captain America. But it\u2019s all in good fun. When the 40-year-old, who is now married to Emily Blunt, found out Evans got cast as Captain America instead of him, he wasn\u2019t upset but rather happy for him. They\u2019d known each other for years and there wasn\u2019t any ill will about the role. In a Feb. 2020 interview with Esquire, Krasinski said he wasn\u2019t competitive about the role or upset in any way when Evans beat him out for the part.\"People have a sense that some of us are insanely competitive. I\u2019ve known Chris forever. So as soon as they said Chris Evans got the part, I was like, \u2018Yeah, look at that guy. Are you kidding me? He is Captain America,\u2019\" he said. He and Chris Evans are \u2018still laughing about it\u2019In the same interview, Krasinski said he had recently crossed paths with Evans shortly before sitting down with the publication, and there wasn\u2019t any bad blood between them, only jokes.\"And I just saw Chris a couple of weeks ago and we were still laughing about it. I said, \u2018I love that you retired in my role,\u2019\" Krasinski said. This wasn\u2019t the first time Krasinski talked about losing out to Evans for the role of Captain America.

The team is co-led by Berhane Asfaw of the Rift Valley Research Service in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Yonas Beyene of the Ministry of Youth, Sports and Culture in Ethiopia;the late J. Desmond Clark, formerly of the University of California, Berkeley; Giday Woldegabriel of the Los Alamos National Laboratory; and Tim White of the University of California, Berkeley. With a nice touch of delicacy, White refers to Clark as \"inspiring but no longer making decisions\" about the project.On October 2, 2009, the team published in Science their analyses of a hominin (member of the human lineage) called Ardipithecus ramidus. The best representative of the species is a partial female skeleton nicknamed Ardi; she is 4.4 million years old and is certainly astonishing and noteworthy. There are parts of at least 35 other individuals in the collection, in addition to thousands of specimens of plants, invertebrates, fish and assorted nonprimate mammals from the same location.Ardi is the oldest partial skeleton in the hominin lineage at present, but she doesn\u2019t represent a new species. Ardipithecus ramidus has been known since the first research paper about it was published in Nature in 1994 under what might be considered an \"alias\": Australopithecus ramidus.The naming of Ardi has had some singular twists and turns. The genus into which the type specimen of Ardipithecus was initially classified was Australopithecus, meaning \"southern ape,\" a term created in 1925 by Raymond Dart to accommodate a face, jaw and endocast (a natural cast of the braincase) of a young juvenile hominin found in South Africa. The \"Taung baby,\" as it was nicknamed, was the oldest (about 2.5 million years) and first member of the human lineage to be found in Africa at that point. Skepticism from the scientific establishment at the time of discovery was rife. The hoaxed Piltdown skull, with its large brain (variously estimated between 1,000 and 1,500 cubic centimeters) and seeming antiquity, had been announced in 1911\u201312 and was still believed to be genuine. Thus the small brain (about 340 cubic centimeters) of the Taung baby was so unexpected that many anthropologists dismissed the fossil as merely an immature, if ancient, ape. Surely our large brain was a fundamental human characteristic extending back to the beginning of our lineage! \"Surely\"\u2014but not in fact.More than 25 years passed before the anthropological community realized what Dart had recognized from his fossil: Our ancestors had humanlike teeth long before they had a large, humanlike brain. Instead of brain size being the fundamental adaptation that separated our earliest ancestors from the apes, it was our teeth and, later discoveries showed, our bipedal locomotion. How surprising\u2014and disappointing to those who had prided themselves on their big brains.Since 1925, many different species of Australopithecus have been described and named, including Australopithecus afarensis, the species to which the famous partial skeleton Lucy belongs. All are bipedal hominins, although not necessarily directly ancestral to modern humans. Some apparently ate fruit, whereas others had a more fibrous diet. Some were larger, some smaller, and most species showed a striking difference in body size between males and females (a trait called sexual dimorphism). Some probably made stone tools. They lived in both East and South Africa and may have been more widely spread across the continent between 4.2 and 1.2 million years ago.", "answers": {"answer_start": [600], "text": ["Berhane Asfaw"]}, "id": "1100188040002123_1111607772193483"}, {"question": "Here's A Sign Your Ex Might Be A Psychopath", "context": "If you're going through a tumultuous breakup and your otherwise hostile ex insists on \"being friends,\" science is here to give you a little tough love: Run in the opposite direction.According to a new study, some people with the so-called \"dark triad\" personality traits -- like narcissism and psychopathy -- keep their exes around for strategic, self serving reasons.Previous research and expert analysis suggests that individuals with dark personality traits like psychopathy engage in behaviors and relationships that are beneficial for their personal gain. Researchers from Oakland University wanted see if this theory also applied to connections with former partners.In the first part of their study, the researchers asked more than 300 participants to name reasons why they would want to be friends with an ex. Then, they narrowed these reasons down to seven concrete categories, such as \"reliability/sentimentality,\" \"pragmatism,\" and \"sexual access.\"The researchers assigned high scores to positive categories (like a former partner was \"reliable, trustworthy and of sentimental value\"), and lower scores to more negative categories (practicality and sexual access). Then, for the second experiment, they gave the list of seven categories to approximately 500 new participants, and asked each of them to rank the categories in order of personal importance to them. These new participants were also given clinical assessments that measured their prevalence of dark personality traits.The results revealed, unsurprisingly, that highly ranking a practical reason for remaining friends with an ex predicted a clinical assessment of narcissism or psychopathy.The findings \"suggest that [a post-relationship friendship] may provide opportunity for ex-partners to exchange desirable resources (e.g., love, status, information, money, sex) after romantic relationship dissolution,\" the study authors wrote in their conclusion. Translation: Not everyone's post-breakup intentions are pure -- particularly if they have dark personalities. It's not a bad idea to proceed with caution when it comes to an ex. The findings offer some fascinating insight on human relationships, specifically when it comes to emotional turmoil. Experts say that maintaining a relationship after a falling out is difficult, especially because -- surprise! -- ulterior motives may be at play.\"[Exes] are less emotionally supportive, less helpful, less trusting, and less concerned about the other person\u2019s happiness,\" Juliana Breines, a social experience researcher and postdoctoral fellow at Brandeis University, wrote in a Psychology Today blog. \"This is especially true, not surprisingly, for former partners who were dissatisfied with the romantic relationship, and in cases when the break-up was not mutual.\"That isn't to say that all exes are terrible people only using you for their pleasure.

FORBES has learned that Johnson, widely regarded as an internet troll, is helping to recommend candidates for government jobs with the incoming presidential administration. (Photo: Screenshot from YouTube.com.)By Ryan Mac and Matt DrangeAn internet troll, who was once called the most hated man on the internet and is banned from Twitter, is recommending candidates to serve in the Trump administration.Charles Chuck Johnson, a controversial blogger and conservative online personality, has been pushing for various political appointees to serve under Donald Trump, according to multiple sources close to the President-elect's transition team. While Johnson does not have a formal position, FORBES has learned that he is working behind the scenes with members of the transition team's executive committee, including billionaire Trump donor Peter Thiel, to recommend, vet and give something of a seal of approval to potential nominees from the so-called alt-right.The proximity to power is something new for Johnson, a self-described journalist, author and debunker of frauds, who has made a name for himself by peddling false information and right-wing conspiracy theories online. In the months leading up to the election, Johnson, 28, used social media and his website GotNews.com to stump for the President-elect while also publishing misinformation on Trump's detractors. Now, Johnson is helping to pick some of the leaders who may run the country for the next four years.FORBES verified Johnson's involvement with multiple people close to the transition team who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. When asked about his work with the transition team, Johnson said last month that he had no formal role, and was vague regarding his level of influence. Johnson agreed to multiple phone and email interviews with FORBES in December, but he declined to return repeated follow-up requests for comment this month.Whether I am listened to or not remains to be seen, Johnson wrote in an email to FORBES in December. I am by and large pretty happy with the government selected thus far, though I am sorry to say that a lot of the candidates that I favor have not been selected.Johnson's statements came before his appearance on an online radio show with libertarian blogger Stefan Molyneux on Dec. 22 during which Johnson declared that he had been doing a lot of vetting for the administration and the Trump transition.The disclosure of Johnson's involvement comes at a time of intense scrutiny for Trump's transition team, whose cabinet picks will begin Senate confirmation hearings this week. Those hearings are moving forward despite the fact that, as of this weekend, the Office of Government Ethics had not completed its review of multiple appointees. It is unprecedented for the Senate to hold confirmation hearings for a President-elect's nominees before formal background checks are completed.Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not return a request for comment. Jeremiah Hall, a spokesman for Thiel, declined to comment.While Twitter banned Johnson in May 2015 after threatening a Black Lives Matters activist, he made a name for himself as an internet troll, or an online personality who antagonizes others by posting inflammatory or misleading information. Among his exploits, Johnson has published the home addresses of New York Times reporters, wrongly identified a woman he thought was the source of Rolling Stone's now-retracted story of an alleged rape at the University of Virginia and claimed that President Barack Obama is gay. On Twitter, like, I have a certain kind of personality, a pugnaciousness, like an alter ego, he said in 2014 to Mother Jones. You know, like when Spider-Man puts on the costume, for instance, he's no longer a mild-mannered photographer. He has an attitude. I do that because I want my content to really go viral.Johnson portrays GotNews as an alternative to the lying mainstream media. He said it receives 2.5 million page views per month. (Quantcast estimated in the last 30 days that about 246,000 people have visited the site.) Recent stories include a piece on Senator Ted Cruz's supposedly imminent Supreme Court nomination and another on Trump's biggest regret in supporting John McCain's 2016 Senate re-election run. Despite his disregard for facts and reckless approach to publishing, Johnson, who was recently photographed at a dinner attended by white supremacists in Washington, D.C., built a significant following among many who self-identified as being a part of the alt-right. Trump drew significant support from those same followers during the election. Mike Cernovich, another pro-Trump troll who is friends with Johnson, said that Johnson often has a hand in behind-the-scenes politics. The media really likes to hate on , Cernovich said. But if they knew how influential he has been--in ways they didn't know--it would be kind of mind blowing.Johnson, who boldly predicted against conventional wisdom and polls that Trump would win, and who was spotted in the VIP section at Trump's election night party, began working with the transition team shortly after Nov. 8. Among his contacts within Manhattan's Trump Tower, where the President-elect has set up camp, is Thiel, a member of the transition's executive committee. A PayPal cofounder and Facebook board member whose vast network of Silicon Valley connections has made him invaluable to the President-elect, Thiel has overseen many of the science and technology appointments for the incoming administration.Johnson has helped in that effort, pushing for at least a dozen potential candidates to Thiel, including Ajit Pai, a commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission, whom Johnson hopes will lead the organization under Trump. Pai declined to comment for this story. As a Republican member of the FCC, Pai is a natural candidate to be considered for the chairmanship of the agency, and Johnson's recommendation suggests he's also favored by a segment of the self-described alt-right. Beyond recommending candidates, Johnson has also helped set up meetings between potential appointees and transition team members. He has worked with Jim O'Neill, who is being considered to head the Food and Drug Administration and is currently employed by Thiel at San Francisco-based investment firm Mithril Capital. Johnson has tried to arrange for O'Neill to meet with conservative influencers and political groups in an effort to build support for his potential FDA nomination. O'Neill declined to comment.Johnson also helped create a database where potential political appointees could send in their resumes to be considered for government positions. He has access to the website ThePlumlist.com, and though the recently created website remains dormant, candidates have been told to send their information to an email account associated with that domain. In November, The Daily Mail reported that Thiel maintains a database called the Plum List to track potential hires and qualified applicants. Sources familiar with the situation described the list as an intake system for the team, and said it was separate from the version that Thiel and his closest associates use to track final selections that are forwarded to Trump.Johnson denied working with Thiel, and said the two had only a passing familiarity. Johnson added that he and Thiel share some of the same enemies, a reference to the now defunct news organization, Gawker Media. Thiel secretly bankrolled former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan's landmark invasion of privacy lawsuit against the New York media organization, which ultimately led to the company's bankruptcy. Separately, Johnson sued Gawker in a California court for defamation after the website published a series of critical and abrasive stories about him.FORBES previously reported that Johnson, while exploring representation for his case, had a phone discussion with lawyers at Harder Mirell & Abrams, the law firm that Thiel paid to represent Hogan, and that Johnson's case had been pitched to other Los Angeles law firms as part of a wider legal strategy against Gawker. Johnson's lawsuit remains on hold, pending a hearing later this month in federal bankruptcy court to determine the fate of Gawker Media's remaining assets.If Gawker is Johnson and Thiel's shared enemy, then Trump advisor and chief strategist Stephen Bannon is their most prominent mutual ally. Johnson worked for Bannon at Breitbart News, where Bannon served as executive chairman before joining Trump's campaign last year. I liked , and was close to him, Johnson said in a December phone interview.Last fall, Johnson and Bannon led an effort prior to the second presidential debate in October to stage a press conference with Trump and four women who have accused Bill Clinton of rape, sexual assault or sexual harassment and Hillary Clinton of protecting an alleged sexual criminal. Johnson claimed to have helped raise more than $10,000 for one of those women, Kathleen Shelton--who alleged that she was raped in 1975 by a man who Hillary Clinton later represented as a public defender--to attend the event.While Johnson denied his recent work with Thiel, he freely discussed his efforts to influence the transition team through his old boss, Bannon. Still, Johnson insisted that while Bannon takes his opinion into consideration, his recommendations are sometimes ignored. Imagine you had an ex-boss who became the consigliere to the President of the United States, Johnson told FORBES last month. You can't be like, 'Dude, you're f***ing up.' Alexandra Preate, a spokesperson for Bannon, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.The full extent of Johnson's involvement in the transition is not clear, though several of his associates have also interfaced with the team in recent weeks. FORBES has learned that Cernovich and Jeff Giesea, a Washington, D.C.-based entrepreneur who worked for Thiel in the past, have also been in contact with transition team members, according to sources. Giesea declined to comment, while Cernovich discussed the transition team's agenda but remained vague when pressed for details of his own work. I want to be free to say whatever I want to say. And in a way that limits what I can do officially, Cernovich said, denying that he has had any direct communication with Thiel or other members of the transition team. I don't want anyone to get jammed up, vis-&agrave;-vis any association with me.Cernovich and Giesea have also organized a party for Trump supporters in Washington, D.C. later this month dubbed the DeploraBall. Cernovich said that 1,000 tickets have been sold for the event, which is billed as the biggest meme ever and will take place at the National Press Club on the eve of Trump's inauguration. Johnson said the event was about giving voice to a group of people who, until Trump's landmark victory in November, were often ignored by the political establishment. When asked if he felt that he had gotten credit for his recent work, Johnson said, Not as much as I deserve.Johnson attributed much of the work that he and others have done in support of Trump to being able to tap into voters' emotions through memes, such as the Pepe the Frog cartoon that became an informal mascot for Trump supporters. Johnson said that memes represent a new way for people to discuss national politics, which he said is dominated by a white paper mindset predicated on debating policy merits based on fact rather than emotion. To hear Johnson tell it, the success of this approach is evidenced by the visceral reaction to memes that generated widespread attention and influenced public perception during Trump's rise to power, despite having little or no basis in fact.The election was won by a bunch of people making memes, Johnson proclaimed.

Burch, who is the chapter\u2019s president, published a blog post on the Young Americans for Liberty website the same day the lawsuit was filed, boasting the success of an April 17 event on U.S. national debt. The post specifically points out how the event raised the organization\u2019s profile to students on campus and the surrounding community.\"We attracted the attention of hundreds of students and managed to get almost 40 new signups for our club,\" wrote Burch. She added their event also made the local newspaper\u2019s front page.Burch and Vizzone's lawsuit repeats a similar situation at another American campus.In February, the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine, which is also representing the Hawaii students, helped a California college student win a $50,000 settlement after he was stopped from handing out copies of the Constitution.The 10 Worst Colleges for Free Speech: 2013", "answers": {"answer_start": [22], "text": ["University of Hawaii at Hilo"]}, "id": "460195335928041472"}, {"question": "Stan Lee Reveals His Favorite Comic Book Movie", "context": "Share.

Photo: Arwa al-Neami/Never Never Land Series .JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia\u2014Joudi al-Omeri drove in circles. And when cars came in her direction, she swerved. These were electric bumper cars, but in Saudi Arabia, the ride doesn\u2019t always live up to its name.\"I come here to drive,\" said Ms. al-Omeri, a 27-year-old homemaker still giddy from the roughly five-minute, mostly crash-free ride in her red-and-green two-seater. \"It\u2019s much better than bumping against others,\" she adds.At the weekly ladies-only night at the Al Shallal Theme Park in the coastal city of Jeddah, women discard head scarves and head-to-toe black gowns to reveal the latest trends\u2014ripped jeans, tank tops, and tossed-to-the-side \u201980s-style hair. For many of them, the biggest draw of the amusement park isn\u2019t the few hours of fashion freedom. Instead, they go there to get behind the wheel\u2014even a bumper-car wheel\u2014in a country that bans female drivers.There are no loud bangs or ferocious head-on crashes. There are a few slow-speed collisions, but also a lot of dodging, as many women are content with just gliding over the smooth surface. For some, the biggest risk of bumping into each other is while taking a selfie.\"They love driving the cars,\" Aman al-Abadi, the ride attendant, said of the women who were getting back in line for another spin. \"Men are always bumping.\"With the exception of remote corners of the desert kingdom\u2014where Bedouin women sometimes get behind the wheel\u2014the amusement park offers a rare, hassle-free environment for women to hone their driving skills. That is partly why, on ladies nights, there is a winding queue at the bumper cars.Outside the theme park, activists, writers and even some politicians now are pushing to lift the ban on driving actual cars. One of the strongest cases proponents make is financial: Many women, even those with jobs, simply can\u2019t afford a driver.In this conservative society, there are many who resist it, warning that allowing women to move freely without a male guardian would expose them to social evils and personal trouble.Among them is Mohammed Bayea, who on mixed-gender evening at the amusement park was happily driving alongside several women on the crowded bumper-car platform. There was the occasional knock, but for the most part men and women steered clear of each other. The women wore traditional dress.\"It\u2019s OK if they drive here,\" said Mr. Bayea, a Riyadh native who was on vacation in Jeddah. But he said he wouldn\u2019t want them driving in the real world. \"I am a nice guy, I don\u2019t flirt with women. But other men will.\"The driving ban has helped lead to the flourishing of ride-hailing apps by companies like Uber Technologies Inc., which recently announced it received a $3.5 billion investment from Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fundENLARGE A theme park in Jeddah holds a women-only night. Photo: Margherita Stancati/The Wall Street Journal .While women at Saudi Arabia\u2019s amusement parks often seek a driving experience that mirrors crash-avoidance reality, men relish bashing into each other. When they take to the bumper cars, their goal\u2014like pretty much everywhere else in the world\u2014is to gather speed for maximum impact.When it comes time for the women to drive in a mixed-gender theme park in the town of Abha, a big black curtain goes up around the bumper car platform to shield the female drivers from outside view. The cars resume driving in circles and the platform becomes placid again.Some women have unwittingly breached the no-bumping etiquette. When, for the first time in years, Arwa al-Neami went on the bumper cars in the theme park in Abha, she decided to chase the other female drivers. She got a lot of angry shouting in return.\"They would scream: \u2018Please, don\u2019t bump me! I am trying to drive!\u2019 \" says Ms. al-Neami, a Jeddah-based artist who began documenting the phenomenon in 2014 as part of an art project called Never Never Land.Some women viewed the bumper car for what it was: Amusement. \"It\u2019s just a game,\" said Darin Twergi, a student, with a shrug. \"It\u2019s not that big a deal if I drive or not.\"Others regard time spent in a brightly colored open-top vehicle with a hot rod attached to the ceiling as a serious practice session.Before she moved abroad for university, Sama bin Mahfooz said she would go to the theme park in Jeddah especially to drive. \"We never get a chance to in Saudi Arabia\u2014this is the right place to do it,\" says Ms. bin Mahfooz, 20. \"Whenever my best friend would hit me, I would tell her: \u2018No, let me drive, let me drive!\u2019 \"Her wealthier friends were less interested. They would say \"we have drivers, we don\u2019t need to do that,\" she recalls.In a country where only 23% of Saudi women have jobs, ladies-only nights bring women out in force. Every employee is in fact a woman, from the popcorn sellers to the security guards to the bumper car attendant. The men have the night off.And while cinemas are normally banned, there are two of them in Al Shallal alone. Granted, the movies last under five minutes, and the experience is really just about the special effects: 3-D screens, seats that jolt and sprays of water.For many women, the biggest attraction of ladies nights is simply a man-free world. One woman says she goes every week, ostensibly to accompany her teenage daughters. \"The girls can wear what they want and roam around freely,\" said Nadia Shamsaan, 33. \"But I also come here to relax,\" she added, sprawled on an outdoor sofa in a patterned shirt and jeans.Outside the park, reality hits. The women step out in their all-covering abayas to find a tangle of traffic that snarls around its perimeter. The men have come to pick them up.Many of the female bumper car drivers confide they would like to sit on the driver\u2019s seat outside the park\u2019s high walls, too.

Hancock has been a vocal opponent of both marijuana legalization and Amendment 64, which voters passed in November 2012 and makes recreational marijuana legal to sell and possess in the state.\"He\u2019s never been a supporter of the industry from day one,\" Fox said. \"I feel like we\u2019re fighting against a city government that doesn\u2019t want us even though the constituents have voted us in. It\u2019s very frustrating.\"When asked by The Denver Post if Hancock \"hated\" the idea of marijuana legalization in the state, Hancock replied with a flat-out \"yes.\"\"I have seen the devastation of the progression of marijuana to harsher drugs like crack cocaine,\" he added. \"And a lot of the folks that have dealt with substance abuse -- particularly with cocaine and crack cocaine -- they started with marijuana.\"Mason Tvert, communications director for Marijuana Policy Project and key backer of the Amendment 64 campaign in Colorado, told HuffPost that Hancock's personal stance shouldn't matter. \"It's Mayor Hancock's responsibility to ensure the implementation is carried out effectively and efficiently, so it is a little shocking that he is still addressing questions about it with diatribes against marijuana and claims that regulating it will somehow lead to increased crack use,\" he said.Tvert added that many city and state officials are working hard to get the marijuana retail system up and running on time, but some lawmakers do appear to be dragging their feet.\"All of the forthcoming marijuana retail stores are currently operating as medical marijuana businesses in good standing,\" he said. \"The law allows for them to open their doors on January 1, and there is no logical reason why they should not be allowed to do so.\"The process to obtain a recreational marijuana license in Colorado is extraordinarily rigorous. Only existing medical marijuana dispensaries in \"good standing\" with the state are able to apply, and shop owners must then be approved by both state and local jurisdictions. Once approved, proprietors gave a public hearing in which they must demonstrate that the proper regulatory controls are in place and that their business doesn't make the neighborhood less safe. Once the hearing is finished and pending approval from the judge, city officials must inspect the premises. All said and done, retail pot shops must obtain a state license, a city license and pass five city inspections.The hearings for the marijuana businesses were supposed to begin in early November, but were delayed for nearly two weeks.\"It has been very smooth in terms of the process,\" Andy Williams, owner of Denver's Medicine Man dispensary, said to HuffPost. \"But the hearings are the tough point. They started late. They were supposed to start in early November, but didn\u2019t start until mid-November. They only do two hearings a day.\"Williams said his shop got through the process very quickly, and he's picking up his inspection card Monday.\"I have no doubt that we will be done with the process and open on January 1,\" Williams said. \"But there will be a lot of people that won\u2019t because they aren\u2019t going to get through the hearing process.

Finally, an emergency room physician in Indianapolis had an idea.\"The first question he asked was if I was taking hot showers to find relief. When he asked me that question, I basically fell into tears because I knew he had an answer,\" Crowder said.The answer was cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, or CHS. It\u2019s caused by heavy, long-term use of various forms of marijuana. For unclear reasons, the nausea and vomiting are relieved by hot showers or baths.\"They\u2019ll often present to the emergency department three, four, five different times before we can sort this out,\" said Dr. Kennon Heard, an emergency room physician at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, Colorado.He co-authored a study showing that since 2009, when medical marijuana became widely available, emergency room visits diagnoses for CHS in two Colorado hospitals nearly doubled. In 2012, the state legalized recreational marijuana.\"It is certainly something that, before legalization, we almost never saw,\" Heard said. \"Now we are seeing it quite frequently.\"Outside of Colorado, when patients do end up in an emergency room, the diagnosis is often missed. Partly because doctors don\u2019t know about CHS, and partly because patients don\u2019t want to admit to using a substance that\u2019s illegal.California overwhelmingly passed a measure to legalize marijuana for recreational use Tuesday. Similar measures passed in three other states, but...CHS can lead to dehydration and kidney failure, but usually resolves within days of stopping drug use.

Longo, a Florida native, thought that the little thing didn\u2019t look good, and he knew that the unrelenting sunshine was taking its toll.Indeed, Longo later recounted how the helpless baby was \"half-dead\" when they first met.

In addition to getting the gift of life, though, Biscuits had also, again thanks to her encounter with Longo, gained a new family.Indeed, alongside her surrogate mother, Biscuits gained some four-legged family friends \u2013 in the shape of Longo\u2019s dogs.

We encourage couples to say this instead of that and to act in this way instead of in that way. We also talk a lot about emotions \u2013 how to manage them and express them in constructive ways.While behaviors and emotions matter in relationships, the emphasis we put on them forces one of our central human attributes onto the back burner: our thoughts.What role do our thoughts and beliefs play in the success or failure of our relationships?As it turns out, one common thought pattern is highly toxic for relationships. You can view it as a core belief or as a mental stance... but I prefer to think of it as a cognitive trap. The trap is this: you believe that there is only one true reality. You believe in finding The Truth with a capital \"T\" and anyone who doesn\u2019t buy into the truth you\u2019ve uncovered is objectively wrong.Simply put, when your mind can\u2019t accept and validate multiple realities, your relationships will suffer.Some common relationship maxims hint at the shortcomings of this belief. For example, \"There are three sides to every story: your side, my side, and the truth.\" This simple truism highlights an understanding that my truth is not The Truth .You\u2019ve also likely heard someone say, \"You can be right or you can be happy.\" This saying points toward the fact that believing your reality is The Reality compels you to convince others \u2013 sometimes aggressively \u2013 that your reality is right. In the process, you\u2019ll invalidate the other person\u2019s reality, drive them away, and find yourself feeling less and less happy.Let\u2019s look at 3 specific ways the \"single reality\" mindset is undermining your relationships:1. It makes your partner a second-class citizen.When you believe that there is only one reality \u2013 and you\u2019re the one pursuing it \u2013 you\u2019ve put yourself in a (self-appointed) position of superiority. You\u2019re basically saying that you hold the key to objective reality and your partner doesn\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t sound like a very fair arrangement, does it?Whether you intend it or not, holding this belief creates a relationship where your partner is a second-class citizen. It throws the idea of an equal partnership out the window.Even worse, taking a stance of superiority fosters feelings of contempt toward others... and according to renowned marriage researcher John Gottman , the presence of contempt in a marriage is the single biggest predictor of divorce.2. It makes disagreements unresolvable.Believing that you \u2013 and you alone \u2013 have access to The Truth undercuts your partner\u2019s right to have their opinion respected. But respecting each other\u2019s opinions is a pre-requisite for successfully resolving disagreements. These two ideas, taken together, illustrate how holding the \"single reality\" mindset makes disputes unresolvable.To successfully resolve disputes, both sides need to have their realities acknowledged and validated by the other. You can fully understand another person\u2019s perspective on something and still disagree. In fact, this is likely the healthiest way to disagree.But without understanding the other person\u2019s perspective first \u2013 because you cannot tolerate alternate perspectives \u2013 you are left with less healthy ways to disagree. These include steamrolling, badgering, and manipulating... all of which undermine the stability of the relationship.3. It\u2019s antagonistic.This cognitive trap \u2013 believing that there is only one true reality \u2013 is profoundly divisive. It sets up a dynamic where you feel compelled to convince the other person of your perspective, not only because you want to \"win\" the fight, but because you want to save them from their \"delusional\" ideas.In other words, when you feel the need to \"convert\" someone to what you believe to be The Truth, you\u2019re driving a wedge between you and them.You\u2019re creating \"otherness.\" And what comes from \"otherness\"? Antagonism.While it\u2019s never easy to change a core belief, you certainly can get better at accepting and validating multiple realities. The first step is to replace the belief that there is only one true reality with a slightly modified one.This new belief would be: \"I am the ultimate authority over my own reality.\"This new belief will serve you better in a few ways. First, it allows you to retain power and authority in the relationship \u2013 which you deserve to have \u2013 just in a narrower context. Second, it gives power and authority to the other person as well, allowing for balanced and productive interactions.Only when both partners have power in the relationship can it finally be the harmonious union you\u2019ve always dreamed of.

In Japan and the far east, it is used as a skin whitener. But now a very large study of 20,000 women in 21 countries has shown it can stop a third of cases of bleeding to death after giving birth.Haemorrhage after childbirth kills 100,000 women a year, mostly in low and middle-income countries. \"It is not only the women dying \u2013 it is the impact on the child that has to grow up without a mother, children who might already be in the family and the husband,\" said associate professor Haleema Shakur from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who led the trial.\"This is of absolutely huge importance. While a single mother is dying, we need to keep fighting for them.\"The drug has already been proven to cut the death toll from bleeding after accidents in a trial of similar size. The latest trial, published in the Lancet medical journal, recruited more than 20,000 women who either gave birth in one of 193 hospitals involved or managed to get there after starting to bleed. They were randomly assigned either tranexamic acid or a placebo.The researchers found that tranexamic acid was most effective when it was given soon after the bleeding began. The trial was originally intended also to find out whether the drug saved women from having to undergo a hysterectomy \u2013 the removal of the womb. But the scientists discovered that in many countries, where anaemia is common and blood supplies are limited, surgeons operated immediately as the surest way to save the woman\u2019s life.If all women who haemorrhage after childbirth were given the drug, the trial suggests that 30,000 lives could be saved a year. In practice, that will be more difficult. Tranexamic acid was given in an intravenous injection in the hospitals, as the quickest way to have an effect. Many women give birth at home and may not get to a hospital in time.\"It is available in the form of a tablet for heavy periods, but absorption may take too long,\" said Shakur. They are now working on new ways to get it rapidly into women\u2019s systems \u2013 perhaps as an injection in the arm muscle or as a capsule under the tongue.

Say it ain't so...", "context": "Before I owned a straightener, I would get down on the floor and drape my long hair over my ironing board and beg my friends to iron out my waves. Then, when I turned 14, I bought a very cheap straightener that fried my strands and made them extremely frizzy. When I turned 15, I bought another straightener that was so small, it would take me hours to make my thick hair stick straight. Finally, when I turned 16, I bit the bullet, invested in a $200 hair straightener and never looked back -- or had to buy another one since. Suffice it to say, I'm a bit of an expert on the subject.Over the years, I've moved away from pin straight locks and I've come to perfect the \"straight-hair-that-doesn't-look-straightened\" 'do. Unbeknownst to many of my friends and co-workers, I use my straightener at least once or twice a week to achieve the slightly-straight but still slightly-wavy bed head look I love.So when I was presented with a new straightener to try, the Ferrum Professional Styler by Ladies & Gents, I was hesitant, to say the least. After all, I hadn't tried a new hot tool in years.Ladies & Gents Ferrum Professional Styler, $180, Ferrumiron.comWhat did excite me about the Ferrum Professional Styler was the fact that it was marketed as a straightener that didn't make your hair stick straight, rather it gave you \"healthy, shiny hair with Blow-Out volume.\" It does so with special clamps: While one side is made of the typical ceramic, the other side has a fabric surface.When I first tried the straightener, I immediately loved the adjustable heat setting. It spans from 140 to 450 degrees, which is great for my coarse hair. Though it took a while to heat up, it did get very hot. But it took me a little longer than usual to straighten my hair because of the fabric half of the straightener, plus the fact that the entire tool was rather thin. While the fabric surface is supposed to limit the damage to your hair, it ultimately is a bit of a time suck.The Ferrum Styler did exactly what it promised: It straightened my hair, but gave it volume. It looked like it was professionally done, which isn't my taste, though I can acknowledge that many people, working women especially, would love the outcome.Rating: 4 out of 5. The straightener was a tad on the thin side, so it took me a while to straighten my extremely thick hair. I also wasn't wild about how \"done\" it ended up looking. That said, the Ferrum Styler got extremely hot and the next day my hair looked perfectly imperfect, just how I like it.", "answers": {"answer_start": [962], "text": ["Ferrum Professional Styler"]}, "id": "403686989477580800"}, {"question": "The promise @jennajameson made to her twin sons", "context": "Five years ago, former adult film star Jenna Jameson thought she'd be married and have the picture-perfect family by now.

From 2009-2013, Reines also served in Clinton\u2019s State Department as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Strategic Communications.  Reines is the managing director of Beacon.In an interview on Sunday with the Cipher Brief, Morell commented on reports in the Washington Post and New York Times claiming Moscow interfered in the presidential election to help Trump win \u2013 a contention the President-elect called \"ridiculous\" in an interview on Sunday.\"It is an attack on our very democracy,\" Morell said. \"It\u2019s an attack on who we are as a people. A foreign government messing around in our elections is, I think, an existential threat to our way of life. To me, and this is to me not an overstatement, this is the political equivalent of 9/11. It is huge and the fact that it hasn\u2019t gotten more attention from the Obama administration, Congress, and the mainstream media, is just shocking to me.\"Morell further asserted that the U.S. must respond overtly to the attack:He stated:The third implication is we need to respond to the Russian attack. We need to deter the Russians and anyone else who is watching this\u2014and you can bet your bottom dollar that the Chinese, the North Koreans, the Iranians are all watching. We need to deter all of those folks from even thinking about doing something like this in the future.I think that our response needs to have two key pieces to it. One is it\u2019s got to be overt. It needs to be seen. A covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect. If you can\u2019t see it, it\u2019s not going to deter the Chinese and North Koreans and Iranians and others, so it\u2019s got to be seen.The second is that it\u2019s got to be significant from Putin\u2019s perspective. He has to feel some pain, he has to pay a price here or, again, there will be no deterrence, and it has to be seen by the rest of the world as being significant to Mr. Putin so that it can be a deterrent.The interview with Morell was widely cited by the news media.\"Former Acting CIA Director Calls Russian Interference In Election \u2018The Political Equivalent Of 9/11,\u2019\" reads a Huffington Post headline.Business Insider ran a piece similarly titled, \"Former acting CIA Director Michael Morell: Russian meddling in US election \u2018is the political equivalent of 9/11.\u2019\"\"Ex-CIA Director: Obama Should Retaliate To Russian Election Hacks Now,\" blasted a Forbes.com headline.Morell\u2019s quotes were cited by USA Today, the Independent and scores of other publications.Morell also appeared Monday on \"CBS This Morning,\" where he supported a CBS News report citing intelligence sources saying the CIA has high confidence that the Russians attempted to influence the presidential election in favor of Trump.\"The C.I.A. doesn\u2019t come to a high-confidence judgment just based on circumstantial evidence. So I think they\u2019ve got more here,\" Morell told the news network. \"I think they\u2019ve got sources who are actually telling them what the intent was.\"The breathless news media coverage of Morell\u2019s recent remarks, reviewed by this reporter, fails to mention Morell\u2019s employment at the firm tied to Hillary Clinton.The coverage of Morell\u2019s remarks also fails to take note of his central role in crafting misleading talking points on the Benghazi attacks.The talking points were used by United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice on Sunday, Sept. 16, 2012, when she appeared on five morning television programs to discuss the White House response to the Benghazi attacks. In nearly identical statements, she asserted that the attacks were a spontaneous protest in response to a \"hateful video.\"Morell addressed his role in editing the talking points during Benghazi testimony on April 4, 2014.The Guardian reported:In his testimony, Morell said he was deeply troubled by allegations made by lawmakers and some in the media \"that I inappropriately altered and influenced CIA\u2019s classified analysis and its unclassified talking points about what happened in Benghazi, Libya in September 2012 and that I covered up those actions.\"\"These allegations accuse me of taking these actions for the political benefit of President Obama and then secretary of state Clinton. These allegations are false,\" Morell said.He said he and the agency could have done a better job, but he dismissed suggestions that the CIA \"cooked the books\" in the assessment of the attack.In a briefing to senators following the attacks, Morell claimed that references to terrorism and al-Qaeda were removed from the Benghazi talking points to \"prevent compromising an ongoing criminal investigation.\"Morell\u2019s assertions were contradicted by a 46-page House Republican report from April 2013 finding the talking points were edited to protect the State Department\u2019s reputation.\"Contrary to administration rhetoric, the talking points were not edited to protect classified information,\" states the \"Interim Progress Report for the Members of the House Republican Conference on the Events Surrounding the Sept. 11, 2012 Terrorist Attacks in Benghazi.\"\"Evidence rebuts administration claims that the talking points were modified to protect classified information or to protect an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),\" the report states, charging the talking points were \"deliberately\" edited to \"protect the State Department.\"States the report: \"To protect the State Department, the administration deliberately removed references to al-Qaeda-linked groups and previous attacks in Benghazi in the talking points used by [United Nations] Ambassador [Susan] Rice, thereby perpetuating the deliberately misleading and incomplete narrative that the attacks evolved from a demonstration caused by a YouTube video.\"Morell resigned from the CIA amid the controversy surrounding the Benghazi attacks, saying he was stepping down to spend more time with his family.Morell, who was considered a favorite to lead the CIA and spent 33 years with the agency, acknowledged in his resignation statement that the reason for his leaving the agency may seem somewhat difficult to believe, but \"when I say that it is time for my family, nothing could be more real than that.\"\"I am passionate about two things in this world \u2013 the agency and my family,\" Morell said in the statement. \"And while I have given everything I have to the Central Intelligence Agency and its vital mission for a third of a century, it is now time for me to give everything I have to my family.\"Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

At least Daenerys from \"Game Of Thrones\" has a look that can be easily recreated with an icy wig; Walter and Jesse from \"Breaking Bad,\" on the other hand, are probably more challenging to imitate accurately in costume form. That would probably explain why people are Googling it so much -- Google notes that searches for \"Breaking Bad\" costumes are three times higher this year, on the heels of the series finale, than they were last year.But the easier route, of course, is \"The Great Gatsby.\" Google reports that Gatsby costume searches are trending highest in New York and California, where we bet lots of stylish gals probably own Gatsby-like dresses and accessories anyway.Which just solved our \"what to be for Halloween\" problem.

He succeeded his father, John Dingell Sr., in a special election that year and went on to win a full term in 1956. Since then, he has been reelected 29 times. He is also one of two remaining World War II veterans in Congress; the other is Rep. Ralph Hall (R-Texas).Dingell officially became the longest-serving member on June 7, 2013, when he was feted by colleagues in both parties and by President Barack Obama for the milestone. Over the past five decades, he has worked with 11 presidents, served with 2,419 House colleagues and cast more than 25,000 votes.The Michigan Democrat will leave behind a legacy of hallmark legislation impacting civil rights, the environment, health care and workers' rights. He presided over the passage of Medicare in 1965, and he wrote the Endangered Species Act, the 1990 Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. He was the lead author of the Affordable Care Act, the Patient's Bill of Rights, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. He has also been a staunch defender of the U.S. auto industry.Dingell served for years as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, arguably the most powerful committee in the House. During his tenure, he subpoenaed top administration officials under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and led oversight hearings that exposed corruption in various government agencies. One of his investigations uncovered $600 toilet seats at the Pentagon.\"We emptied the top leadership of the EPA,\" Dingell told Newsweek in 2006. \"We put a large number of FDA people in jail.\"He lost his chairman post to Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) in 2008, though he was given the title of chairman emeritus in honor of his years leading the committee.Dingell hasn't had much trouble getting reelected over the years, receiving less than 62 percent of the vote just twice when Republicans swept the House in 1994 and 2010. He didn't even have a GOP opponent in 1988 and 2006. Still, it nearly cost him his election early on when he came out in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He told the Associated Press that the Wall Street Journal gave him a \"one in 15 chance\" of winning the race that year.Dingell already knew his way around the halls of Congress before his first House run. He was a congressional page from 1938 until 1943. He joined the Army in 1944 and later attended Georgetown University, where he graduated with a chemistry degree and eventually a Juris Doctor. He worked as a lawyer in private practice until 1955, when his father passed away and he decided to run for his House seat.Between Dingell and his father, the two have represented the southeastern Michigan area for more than 80 years.\"Decades after his father first introduced a bill for comprehensive health reform, John continued to introduce health care legislation at the beginning of every session.

He previously covered technology for Bloomberg News.At first, investors didn't appear too pleased with Sunny Optical Technology Group Co.'s 77 percent increase in second-half 2016 net income. But now the maker of smartphone cameras seems to have been forgiven.Despite beating estimates, Sunny Optical's Hong Kong-traded stock tumbled 4 percent on Tuesday. Much of that was recouped in early trading on Wednesday, amid volumes about 1.7 times the 20-day average.To put those moves in context, Sunny's 66 percent rise this year -- including a 10.4 percent pop on Friday before the results -- makes it the best performer in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Investors have been betting that strong demand and higher prices for dual-lens cameras would drive earnings. Which they did.They also know that what goes up must come down, so the debate being played out this week is whether now is the time for a fall, or whether there's more room for growth.If anyone was looking for an excuse to sell after the company released earnings late Monday, they found it in the fact that Sunny's strongest sales growth in two years was below estimates. Yet a bullish sign could be found in a gross margin that was more than 2 percentage points wider than anticipated, and the highest in almost five years.And that's kind of the problem.Sunny's biggest risk is margin shrinkage as competitors ramp up production of dual cameras and enter areas where it has enjoyed nascent growth, such as drones and cars. Largan Precision Co., which makes camera lenses, posted a 38 percent year-on-year jump in sales for the January-February period, for example.In two separate reports this month, Jefferies analyst Rex Wu outlined the problem for Sunny and its shareholders. A survey in China found that consumers listed a dual camera as the most desirable smartphone feature, with 55 percent saying they'd be willing to pay more for one. Tellingly, they didn't seem to care much about water proofing or force touch.Sunny Optical stock, YTD+66%Post earnings, Wu argued that profits are more sensitive to shrinking gross margins for dual cameras than they are to sales volumes, and noted competition is getting more intense. While Wu raised his income forecast, he was the only analyst tracked by Bloomberg to cut his recommendation (from buy to hold), saying it's time for the stock to take a breather.Blurring the picture further is the fact that the consensus among analysts this week has been to raise their price targets on Sunny, but not by much and to an average barely above where the shares currently trade.That puts the onus back on the buy-side to decide: Are the clouds growing dark for this index star, or is the future, well, sunny?This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan in Taipei at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Katrina Nicholas at knicholas2@bloomberg.net", "answers": {"answer_start": [162], "text": ["Sunny Optical Technology Group Co."]}, "id": "841909208543027200"}, {"question": "What happened to Rubio?", "context": "The 2016 demise of Marco Rubio has been obvious for a while, but it is nevertheless a very big event. He was the Republican Party\u2019s choice. He lost.Starting last fall, I said he would be the most likely winner. I continued saying that through the early primaries and caucuses. In fact, he seemed on track to win up until his disappointing Super Tuesday on March 1, and even in the days after that I thought he was in fairly good shape -- that is, right up until his support collapsed the weekend after Super Tuesday.Since I have been dead wrong about Rubio, I can't turn around immediately and tell you why he lost. It\u2019s something all of us who study presidential nominations are going to need to study, and it\u2019s going to take some time, especially for those who believe that strong parties made up of formal organizations and informal networks control their presidential nominations.Is this year a fluke? A sign that the system has changed? Frankly, I don\u2019t know right now.But I can run through some reasonable explanations of what happened with Rubio.The party chose a fatally flawed candidate. Some commentators have floated variations of this explanation. One is that Rubio wasn\u2019t appealing to Republican voters. But for most of the contest, Rubio\u2019s favorability scores among Republicans were excellent. Even when he lagged in the horse-race polls, he usually did well when pollsters probed beyond the top vote choice among Republicans.I\u2019m also skeptical of blaming his position on immigration or his hawkish foreign policy. Both John McCain and Mitt Romney won Republican nominations with problems that were more severe.A more plausible explanation of Rubio's weakness is that he choked under pressure. His poor debate before the New Hampshire primary when he repeated a line multiple times, and his debate after Super Tuesday when he got down in the mud with Trump, both appear to have been disasters.The party is broken. Though parties normally choose their nominees, this Republican Party isn't normal -- it\u2019s dysfunctional. Political scientist Norman Ornstein has pushed this line since August, and he could be correct.Republicans' attacks on experts, the media and even the \"establishment\" of their own party made it more difficult than it should have been to explain why Donald Trump was such a pariah.But it was about more than Trump. Party actors took a long time to decide on Rubio, and even then their choice wasn\u2019t close to a consensus. Some of them permitted Jeb Bush to stay in through South Carolina, and he spent that Bush faction's considerable resources targeting Rubio. Another substantial faction supported Ted Cruz, even though many Washington Republicans dislike him so much that they were willing to play footsie with Trump back in January. And John Kasich has had a fair amount of party support as well, which perhaps is why he has been able to fight on.Trump. No theory could have accounted for him. (People have used the analogy of the Mule in Isaac Asimov\u2019s \"Foundation\" books, a mutant whose inhuman abilities disrupted the normal development of politics in the universe.)But I\u2019m skeptical of this explanation, too. Trump is good at grabbing the new media's attention, but it\u2019s hard to see much evidence that he\u2019s unusually talented in any other way. Still, if the party's power flows from its ability to capture voters\u2019 attention, it fizzled when the news coverage of Trump overwhelmed other sources of information.None of the above explanations are mutually exclusive. Perhaps they all played a role.Rubio finished just 1 percent of the vote behind Trump in Iowa. If Republican party actors had converged on him a few weeks earlier \u2013 or if Bush\u2019s super PAC had targeted Trump or Cruz with some of the ads aimed at Rubio, the Florida senator could easily have finished second or even won the state, perhaps knocking out Cruz. If he hadn\u2019t botched the New Hampshire debate, he probably would have finished second there, knocking out Kasich (probably) and Bush (perhaps) earlier and setting up a better finish in South Carolina.If Kasich had dropped out after South Carolina and Nevada, Rubio might have won Virginia on Super Tuesday and picked up a lot more delegates in other states that day. If only three candidates remained when Rubio began attacking Trump, Rubio\u2019s supporters might have stuck with him. And if Rubio had performed better while attacking Trump, it\u2019s possible that none of the rest would have mattered.Every candidate has \"ifs\" they can look back on. Rubio, however, may not have needed all of these things to break this way -- maybe only a few. Maybe only one.The take-away here is that Rubio\u2019s loss is inconsistent with the theory that parties control nominations and that Trump\u2019s success is inconsistent with views the scholars of political parties have had about the presidential-selection process.When more evidence emerges, we can adjust our theories or, sometimes, toss them out entirely and search for new ones.For everyone else, the campaign goes on, with three unexpected candidates remaining.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.To contact the author of this story:Jonathan Bernstein at jbernstein62@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story:Katy Roberts at kroberts29@bloomberg.net", "answers": {"answer_start": [0], "text": ["Rubio Failed"]}, "id": "710168305278033920"}, {"question": "@DrewBarrymore reveals her very unusual home hobby", "context": "We had no idea Drew Barrymore was such a design enthusiast.

The category\u2019s four other nominated actors\u2014Judy Davis, Joan Plowright, Vanessa Redgrave, and Miranda Richardson\u2014all had more experience and critical respect. Their movies (Husbands and Wives, Enchanted April, Howards End, and Damage, respectively) were decidedly heavier and more Oscar-friendly than the crowd-pleasing sleeper hit, My Cousin Vinny, for which the Oscar was awarded to Tomei. Maybe worst of all, Vinny had been released over a year before the 1993 ceremony\u2014and the Academy has a notoriously bad memory for anything released before Q4's \"Oscar season.\"But against all odds, Marisa Tomei won. On the way up the stairs to the podium, she nearly tripped. It was a bad omen. Within a year, her fairytale night had been overtaken by fiction: a rumor circulated that Marisa Tomei wasn\u2019t the intended winner of the Oscar she took home.It started, ironically, as a correction. On Tuesday, March 22, 1994, the day after that year\u2019s Academy Awards ceremony, The Hollywood Reporter printed an item called \"And the loser is: bad Oscar rumor,\" which detailed an alleged word-of-mouth conspiracy theory:A rumor is currently making the rounds in Manhattan, fanned by no less than the former son-in-law of a distinguished Academy Award winner, to wit that last year Marisa Tomei received her Oscar statue by error, with a resultant scandal about it soon to be exposed, much to the shame of the Academy. (All of this quite erroneous, I hasten to add, but do read on.) According to the rumor, it happened because Oscar presenter Jack Palance hadn\u2019t been able to read the name written in the secret envelope when he was on stage announcing 1992's best supporting actress winner. Instead of asking for help, so sayeth the tale, Palance arbitrarily called out Tomei\u2019s name instead of the actual winner. (Since the story is bunk, there\u2019s no need to reveal the name of the lady who was/is being bandied as the \"real\" winner of that specific prize.) It makes for provocative gossip, all right, but it didn\u2019t happen. And for a good reason: When the Oscar ceremonies first went public on television back in 1953, Academy officials were aware of the possibility that one day some presenter might make such an error, either accidentally or for some mischievous purpose. So ever since then, at each and every Academy ceremony \u2014 including last night\u2019s event, and the preceding year\u2019s \u2014 two members of the accounting firm of Price-Waterhouse, the company that has tabulated the final Oscar ballots since 1935, are present in the wings during each Oscarcast. In the event a presenter should err in naming the correct winner in any category, said P-W official has been instructed to immediately go to the podium and announce that a mistake had been made. So Marisa, stand assured that Oscar is adamantly yours, no matter what rumor may sayeth to the contrary.Virtually every item that has been written about this theory (its snopes entry, for example) names the Hollywood Reporter item as its printed origin. It only spread from there\u2014in the April 8, 1994 issue of Entertainment Weekly, the rumor crossed over from the trades to a consumer rag with a much wider circulation. EW\u2019s piece further twisted the \"nasty-and-totally-unfounded little tidbit\":As the rumor goes, award presenter Jack Palance inadvertently read the name of the final nominee off the TelePrompTer, instead of the name in the envelope. And depending on who tells the story, the winner was either Judy Davis for Husbands and Wives or Vanessa Redgrave for Howards End.The EW piece repeated the bit about a Price Waterhouse official being authorized to interrupt the ceremony, and implied that the rumor spread because Tomei had \"made a few enemies\" since winning the Oscar. It also included a quote from her publicist at the time, Gina Rugolo, who said, \"It\u2019s not even worth commenting on.\"Later that year, Tomei disregarded Rugolo\u2019s words when she hosted SNL. During the opening monologue of the Oct. 1, 1994 episode, Tomei addressed the gossip seconds after walking out on stage:Before we start, I wanted to say something, just wanted to clear the air. There\u2019s this crazy rumor, some of you may have heard it, some of you may have not, that when I won the Academy Award for My Cousin Vinny, that I didn\u2019t really win the Oscar, that because Jack Palance accidentally read the wrong name off the teleprompter. But that\u2019s just absolutely not true! I won the Academy Award, fair and square, and I was just the happiest I\u2019d ever been, since, um, since I was named Ms. Teenage America, thank you, back in 1987, the year it was hosted by Jack Palance. Or three years later when I stepped up on stage to receive\u2014though I didn\u2019t think I was eligible for it\u2014the Heisman Trophy from Jack Palance. Anyway, the only award I ever felt slightly guilty about was when I was 16 and I was named Employee of the Month at Roy Rogers restaurant by the assistant manager, Jack Palance. Anyhow, that\u2019s out of the way...Two years later, SNL revisited the rumor in a skit called \"The Joe Pesci Show,\" during which Cheri Oteri played Tomei and Jim Breuer played Tomei\u2019s Vinny co-star, Joe Pesci. In the skit, Pesci and Robert De Niro (played by John Goodman) mock Tomei by suggesting that she received her Oscar in exchange for sex and that her \"fair and square\" claim was a lie.[There was a video here]It didn\u2019t matter that the story was presented to the public in the form of a denial (with Academy Awards officials repeatedly weighing in) or that Tomei herself addressed it and attempted to laugh it off\u2014it persisted. In a Los Angeles Times article that ran on March 23, 1995, columnist Steve Harvey reported \"the rumor still hasn\u2019t died\" and said it had been invoked at the recent Southern California Sports Broadcasters Assn. Awards. During a 1997 episode of Geraldo, the quintessentially bitchy critic Rex Reed is said to have deemed the supposed truth behind Tomei\u2019s win \"Hollywood\u2019s best-kept secret.\" A reader named James Berg wrote in to Roger Ebert\u2019s \"Movie Answer Man\" column asking him to shed light on Reed\u2019s allegations, reporting what he\u2019d seen on Geraldo:According to Reed, a blunder by presented Jack Palace erroneously resulted in the awarding of the statue to Marisa Tomei for My Cousin Vinny, instead of Vanessa Redgrave. Reed explained a \"stoned\" or \"drunk\" Palance read the last name on the Teleprompter and did not properly open the envelope and name the winner as Redgrave.Ebert referred back to a column he\u2019d written just months before on the matter and then quoted Academy Executive Director Bruce Davis, who said, \"There is no more truth to this version than to any of the others we\u2019ve heard.\" Davis also repeated that Price Waterhouse officials would take to the podium in the case of an error, adding, \"They are not shy.\"From the start, all evidence explicitly pointed to bullshit, and yet enough people believed the story to keep it alive for years. Maybe it was selective exposure, the psychological theory that people will believe what they want to believe, regardless of the actual information being communicated. (When I thought back to this rumor, I remembered that Entertainment Weekly printed it\u2014I did not remember that EW ran it in the form of a correction. That such a fuck-up could occur and be allowed to stand is a tantalizing prospect.)Can you blame them? The setting for Tomei\u2019s win was a perfect storm: She was a dark horse newcomer nominated for a comedy that was by then over a year old. Presenting her the award was a 74-year-old wild card who\u2019d done one-armed pushups during his Oscars acceptance speech the year before (incidentally, he also won for a comedy: City Slickers). Before naming Tomei in 1993, Palance called Judy Davis \"Joan\" and said that Davis was British (she\u2019s Australian). If any presenter at the Oscars could be called unreliable, it was Palance. Just believable enough to be spread, spread just enough to take hold, it was the kind of Hollywood rumor that would be impossible to kill.Would be, if you didn\u2019t have access to the video.What makes the rumor particularly fascinating in retrospect is that it occurred before the rise of instant video online. If Tomei had won this year, there would never have been a question about the integrity of her Oscar\u2014just a few keystrokes would allow you to disprove the story to all but the blind and very dumb. Search YouTube and you\u2019ll see that Palance clearly reads Tomei\u2019s name off the card in the envelope\u2014there\u2019s no second consultation of the teleprompter, he\u2019s not making it up as he goes along.(If nothing else, the Tomei rumor will go down as one of the last great Hollywood conspiracy theories of the pre-internet era. It was much easier to miss things, much harder to retrieve what you\u2019d already read and remembered just a bit of; in the \u201890s, if you missed SNL, you were out of luck. Sure, maybe you recorded it on VHS, but if you didn\u2019t, you had no blogs to rely on to report on what happened the night before. You can see how easy it was to say, \"I heard on SNL they said Marisa Tomei didn\u2019t win her Oscar...\")In any event, it quickly became clear that the rumor was only one of Tomei\u2019s problems. Worse than the whispers was the actual direction of her career. She\u2019d fallen victim to the so-called \"Best Supporting Actress Curse\"\u2014the same one that afflicted Geena Davis, Mercedes Ruehl, Mira Sorvino, Kim Basinger, Marcia Gay Harden, Rene\u0301e Zellweger, Jennifer Hudson, Pene\u0301lope Cruz, Mo\u2019Nique, and Melissa Leo, who all saw their acting careers slump or cease existing after their wins. Getting an Oscar, of course, isn\u2019t a bad peak to anyone\u2019s career. But no one wants to peak that early. This quote from a 2001 profile in Australia\u2019s Sunday Telegraph says it all:\"After My Cousin Vinny...I expected my career to be bigger than it is now,\" [Tomei] said as she celebrated her 36th birthday.Soon enough, it got bigger. The following year, Tomei was nominated for another Oscar (for In the Bedroom); seven years later, she was nominated again, for 2008's The Wrestler. She didn\u2019t win either time, but inevitably the Vinny controversy came up in press regarding both nominations. She was asked to explain the rumor repeatedly (\"hurtful\" is how she put it)\u2014at least the continued reporting on it included her voice. Tomei was allowed to reclaim her story.Tomei is now one of only 21 people to be nominated for the Actress in a Supporting Role trophy three times or more; she\u2019s appeared in several movies that have grossed over $100 million (including Anger Management, Parental Guidance, and Wild Hogs); and she was recently cast as Gloria Steinem in HBO\u2019s upcoming Ms. miniseries. That Marisa Tomei ended up doing pretty well for herself.Now that Tomei\u2019s career is ascendant again, the most pernicious effect of the rumor might be the implication that she didn\u2019t deserve the Oscar in the first place. She did. Out of all of the movies nominated in her category, My Cousin Vinny is the only one that remains relevant today through cable and broadcast reruns (thanks to it being, you know, entirely enjoyable). And a big component of its charm is Tomei\u2019s sparkling performance as one of those tough-broad East-Coast Italian roles loved by actors and audiences alike. Playing a broad comic part with depth and nuance is a difficult feat, and Tomei nailed it. She earned her Oscar just as much as Vinny earned that acquittal.[Photo via AP]", "answers": {"answer_start": [2125], "text": ["the story is bunk"]}, "id": "583691155763625984"}, {"question": "This is the best Android phone you can buy", "context": "Shopping for a smartphone can be an intimidating process.

Each one has impressive features, but only one is the best.Samsung Galaxy S7: Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7 looks a lot like its predecessor, the Galaxy S6. It features a metal frame ensconced by front and back glass panels. Everything about the phone\u2019s design is nearly perfect.Adding to that is the fact that the S7 is waterproof. You can drop the handset in up to 3 feet of water for 30 minutes and it will keep working, no problem. Unfortunately, thanks to its smooth glass body, the S7 is also a fingerprint magnet, which takes away from its luster.HTC 10: The HTC 10 comes completely wrapped in a metal body with exaggerated chamfered edges that cause light to delicately reflect off of the handset.Up front, an edge-to-edge glass panel makes the 10 feel as luxurious as any phone on the market. It is, however, a bit on the bulky side.LG G5: Like the S7 and 10, the LG G5 sports a metal body. But the G5 is unique in that the handset has no physical home button on its front panel. Instead, LG has placed the home button on the back of the phone within easy reach of your pointer finger.The G5 has been designed as a modular handset, which means you can remove the bottom of the phone to do things like change its removable battery or add a camera or speaker extensions.The takeaway: Each of these phones is well-designed and attractive, but the fact that the S7 is waterproof is incredibly appealing. Sure the LG G5 allows you to swap out your battery, but I\u2019d rather have to recharge my phone than worry about it being ruined after falling in a puddle.DisplaySamsung Galaxy S7: Packing a 5.1-inch display, the Galaxy S7\u2019s Super AMOLED (active matrix of organic light-emitting diodes) display is among the brightest and most vibrant you\u2019ll find on a smartphone. Colors explode off the screen, and blacks are incredibly deep.The only downside: Colors can look exaggerated at times, causing things like blue skies to look a bit unnatural.HTC 10: HTC equipped the 10 with a 5.2-inch Super LCD 5 display that when viewed head-on looks clear and crisp. The problem is that the 10\u2019s screen is incredibly dim.By itself its screen seems plenty bright, but place it next to the S7, and it\u2019s a completely different story.LG G5: HTC\u2019s 10 isn\u2019t the only phone with a dim display. In fact, the LG G5\u2019s 5.3-inch panel is even dimmer than the 10\u2019s. Like the 10, text and images viewed on the G5 look clean and sharp, but the screen just isn\u2019t bright enough even when viewed inside under normal lights. Trying to view the screen in bright sunlight is almost uncomfortable.The takeaway: There\u2019s no contest here, the Galaxy S7 has the brightest, most colorful display of the group.CameraSamsung Galaxy S7: Samsung made a big deal about the S7\u2019s new 12-megapixel camera \u2014 and for good reason. It takes some of the best shots you\u2019ll get with a smartphone.Colors look fantastic, and details are razor sharp. What\u2019s more, the S7 is an absolute beast when it comes to taking pictures in low-light situations. That said, Samsung\u2019s cameras tend to exaggerate certain colors.HTC 10: The HTC 10\u2019s 12-megapixel rear camera is one of the most capable shooters HTC has produced. Images come out clear, and low-light photos are reasonably clean. If this was your everyday shooter, you\u2019d have little to complain about.That said, the 10\u2019s camera doesn\u2019t offer as much color as the S7\u2019s. Instead, some scenes can look a bit washed out. You\u2019ll also see some pixelation in your low-light shots. And taking pictures with too much movement while in low-light situations causes a good deal of blurring.LG G5: The G5 is unique in that it has two separate lenses for different shooting situations. One lens is used for your standard close-up shots and captures 16-megapixel images, while the other is designed for large panoramic pictures and captures 8-megapixel images. In reality, though, you\u2019ll more than likely end up using the phone\u2019s standard 16-megapixel camera.Photos taken with the G5\u2019s 16-megapixel shooter were clear and artifact-free. In terms of color, the G5\u2019s shots fell between the HTC 10 and Galaxy S7. They weren\u2019t washed out or were they overly saturated. Low-light shots were clear, though not as bright as the Galaxy S7\u2019s pictures.The takeaway: None of these three phones takes bad photos, but between the three, I lean toward the Galaxy S7\u2019s camera, as I\u2019m a fan of its exaggerated colors and its low-light photo capabilities.PerformanceSamsung Galaxy S7: Powered by a quad-core processor and 4GB of RAM, the S7 is an incredibly powerful handset. I\u2019ve been using the phone since it came out and haven\u2019t seen any signs of slowdown or lag. I\u2019m also continually impressed by how fast the S7\u2019s fingerprint reader unlocks the handset.The S7 comes with 32GB of onboard storage. And if you run through all of that, you can always throw in your own microSD card to increase the S7\u2019s storage capacity.The S7\u2019s battery will last all day on a single charge, and thanks to its fast-charging capabilities, you can get a 50 percent charge in 30 minutes.HTC 10: The HTC 10 comes with the same quad-core processor and 4GB of RAM as the S7, so you\u2019re not going to see a huge difference between the two handsets in terms of performance. Also like the S7, the 10 comes with 32GB of storage that can be expanded using the phone\u2019s microSD card slot.Like the Galaxy S7, the 10 will also charge to 50 percent in 30 minutes.LG G5: It\u2019s de\u0301ja\u0300 vu all over again, folks. The LG G5, like the HTC 10 and S7, has the same processor and 4GB of RAM. In other words, these phones are all fast. You\u2019ll also get 32GB of onboard storage that can be expanded with a microSD card.The LG G5 does, however, have a slightly smaller battery than the S7 and HTC 10. Still, you can remove and replace the G5\u2019s power plant when it\u2019s running low on juice, something you can\u2019t do with the S7 or HTC 10.The takeaway: You\u2019re not going to see any major differences in terms of performance between these three phones, but the LG G5\u2019s removable battery sets it apart from the pack.SoftwareSamsung Galaxy S7: Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7 runs on the Google\u2019s Android 6.0 operating system, but augments the software with its own TouchWiz interface. TouchWiz basically changes Android\u2019s home screen, icon designs, and notifications menu to give it a more Samsung-centric look.Normally I dislike it when smartphone makers mess with Google\u2019s Android, and Samsung used to be the No. 1 offender when it came to screwing with the software. But in recent years, the company has eased up on its changes. Its new version of TouchWiz is less intrusive than previous iterations and easier to navigate. It\u2019s still not pure Android, though.HTC 10: This is as close to running an untouched version of Google\u2019s Android 6.0 software as you can get short of buying one of Google\u2019s own Nexus phones. HTC has only made slight changes to Google\u2019s Android interface, and the user experience is better for it. On top of that, HTC has done away with its own apps that essentially mirror existing Google apps, so you don\u2019t have to deal with having two photo gallery apps or two Web browsers.LG G5: LG also runs Google\u2019s Android 6.0 operating system, but unfortunately the OS is completely covered by LG\u2019s confusing user interface. See, like Samsung, LG puts its own stamp on Android by changing the operating system\u2019s icons and notification menu.But the notifications menu is such an odd bright green and white color scheme, that it\u2019s almost hard to read. And LG\u2019s decision to not give people a standard Android apps page and instead put every app on the phone\u2019s various home screens like the iPhone is annoying.Suffice it to say, I\u2019m not a fan.The takeaway: While Samsung has toned down its TouchWiz interface, I\u2019ve got to give this round to HTC for going with what already works \u2014 straight-up Android.And the winner is ...After five rounds, the Samsung Galaxy S7 came out head and shoulders above its competitors. If you\u2019re in the market for an Android phone, the S7 is easily the best option available.That said, if the ability to replace your phone\u2019s battery is of the utmost importance, you should grab LG\u2019s G5. Similarly, if you\u2019re interested in an Android phone that doesn\u2019t cover up the Android interface with a silly skin, the HTC 10 is worth checking out.But overall, the Samsung Galaxy S7 is the best Android phone you can buy.", "answers": {"answer_start": [504], "text": ["Samsung Galaxy S7"]}, "id": "1093444104031880_1095918130451144"}, {"question": "We Tried The World\u2019s Hottest Pepper And It Didn\u2019t Go Very Well", "context": "Meet the Carolina Reaper pepper. It's literal hellfire.We got a bunch of brave souls together to try a Carolina Reaper pepper this week. Why, you might ask? Earlier this month, YouTuber Lizzy Wurst recorded a video that has since gone mega-viral. In the video, Wurst and her friend Sabrina try eating a Reaper pepper. It. Does. Not. Go. Well. For. Them. People couldn't get enough of it, mostly because Wurst and her friend's reactions are completely amazing. But also, it made the whole world wonder: Just how spicy is this thing? So, for journalism, we decided to find out just how spicy this thing is. TURNS OUT IT'S REALLY SPICY. For reference, a jalape\u00f1o is, like, 3,500 Scovilles \u2014 which is the unit of measurement for spiciness. A Carolina Reaper pepper has been named the hottest pepper in the world by Guinness and it clocks in around 2 million Scovilles.First up, we have Tolani. What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten? I\u2019m Nigerian so I feel like a lot of my meals are spicy and if the meal\u2019s not spicy, I feel like it makes me feel a bit sick. We have a Nigerian dish, it\u2019s called ayamase, it\u2019s basically a lot of Scotch bonnets and loads of peppers mixed together to make a stew and you have it with rice.VERDICT: Not the worst thing that's ever happened or that's gone in my mouth, haha. But yeah, it's spicy.Then Ryan. What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten?My mom's side of the family is from Oklahoma, which is kind of like the Canada of Texas, and they all love barbecue and trying different hot sauces. The spiciest thing I've ever eaten was a chili made with Ghost chili peppers \u2014 the second-hottest pepper in the world. It made me feel stoned and my face went numb.VERDICT: I wanted to eat the whole thing, but that was dumb. Very, very dumb. Honestly, though, I'd put a little bit of this on pizza or something.Now it's Aisha's turn.What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten?I used to have chili competitions with my friend. We would try to make the spiciest chutney and we used to even put Naga Morich in it, which is a Bengali spice \u2014 and a close cousin of the Ghost chili pepper.VERDICT: I underestimated it. It was really hot and I thought I was going to cry.Laura's up next. What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten?Growing up in a typical American, semi-Jewish household, there was not much spice going on. My brother did like spicy foods, but that was, like, Sriracha sauce. The spiciest thing I\u2019ve ever eaten would probably be, like, a curry. What\u2019s the spicy one? Vindaloo?VERDICT: I thought I was going to throw up.Also, this happened...And finally, Luke. What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten?I don\u2019t like spicy food. It just doesn\u2019t interest me. The spiciest thing I\u2019ve ever eaten was probably, like, this pasta I ate once that had a load of chilis in it. I don\u2019t know what the fuck they were, but they were chilis.VERDICT: It was really hot but, like, I could use it in cooking. My tongue hurt.

But continued complaints from residents about its poor quality has prompted multiple protests -- and a comparison likening the questionable water to both the Holocaust and slavery.Rev. Charles Williams II, president of the Michigan chapter of the National Action Network, made the comment at a press conference and bottled water handout in Flint Monday, NBC 25 reports.\"This is almost as bad as gas chambers for Jews,\" Williams said.In a follow-up with FOX 2, Williams said forcing Flint residents to buy bad water is \"just as unjust as slavery. That's just as unjust as genocide. An injustice is an injustice.\"Issues with water quality in Flint stretch back to last year, but were made official in January when residents were notified that the city was in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Water tested at the end of 2014 contained unacceptable levels of trihalomethanes (TTHM), chemicals that are a byproduct of chlorine.At the time, the city said water was safe to drink, but advised the elderly, parents of infants and anyone with a \"severely compromised immune system\" to consult a doctor because they may be at increased risk.The chlorine that led to an overabundance of TTHM chemicals was used as a disinfectant; Flint increased the level of chlorine in its drinking water last year to fight bacteria. Health risks associated with drinking water that contains excessive quantities of TTHM over multiple years include cancer, as well as liver, kidney and central nervous system issues, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Residents have reported skin problems and rashes seemingly caused by the water. Others have complained about headaches, hair loss, odor, and water that is cloudy or a startling shade of brown. According to the Detroit Free Press, the discoloration is likely unrelated to the TTHM levels, and instead caused by calcium and iron from pipes in the city\u2019s aging water system.Flint used to buy pre-treated water from Detroit, but in a cost-cutting measure last year officials decided to build a pipeline to Lake Huron so the city could get its own water. The city has been getting its water from the Flint River since April as the pipeline project progresses.Many Flint residents might not have used Williams\u2019 rhetoric, but plenty are seriously concerned about their water, and have been since the city made the switch last year. They have held continual protests and community events -- one attended by a water expert for Erin Brockovich -- and are not mollified by test results in February that showed TTHM levels were back below the federal maximum.\"I don't even let my dogs drink this water,\" resident Rick Holtstander told the Associated Press.Local prekindergarten programs and the Flint Children's Museum are not allowing children to drink tap water, according to MLive.General Motors stopped using Flint water at a local plant in October. They said high chloride levels in the drinking water were causing corrosion, according to WNEM.In a statement issued to MLive, the city said officials share Williams\u2019 frustrations, but think his \"accusations are a gross misrepresentation of the Flint water condition and a wholly inappropriate comparison.\"Flint has formed a Water Advisory Committee and hired a consultant, who on Wednesday recommended changes to infrastructure and the chemicals used to treat the water.In a statement following last month's test results, Department of Public Works Director Howard Croft said staff will be \"vigilant\" about water safety.\"Findings by the [Michigan Department of Environmental Quality] reinforce the progress we have made, and should help rebuild confidence in the safety of Flint\u2019s drinking water,\" Croft said.Last month, the state of Michigan awarded Flint $2 million to upgrade its water system.", "answers": {"answer_start": [10], "text": ["in Flint, Michigan"]}, "id": "573929122809921536"}, {"question": "Southerners Do This One Quirky Thing More Than Any Other Americans", "context": "Southern folks: Y'all are known for your sweet tea, hospitality, charming accents, and oh-so-much more, but now there's one quirky quality you can add to the list, too.It may come as no surprise that Southerners do one thing in the shower more than any other Americans.

Two short little phrases: \"There has been an awakening. Have you felt it?\" Followed by \"The dark side...and the light.\" With all the visuals that we can break down, there\u2019 are only these two brief snippets of actual dialogue to consider. The first and most important question may be, who is speaking?The identity of the narrator was a big topic of discussion Friday after the trailer hit. Speculation about the person\u2019s identity ran from Max Von Sydow to Adam Driver, Andy Serkis and even Benedict Cumberbatch. The last one isn\u2019t even in the movie, but it sounds a bit like him. Because he was at the center of J.J. Abrams\u2019 last big mystery, it was a fun option to consider.There will be no more considering. The identity of the Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer voice has been revealed.Update: Andy Serkis has given a brief radio interview confirming that it is his voice in the trailer. Watch that below.The Force Awakens trailer voice is, in fact, Andy Serkis, seen below in his Avengers: Age of Ultron look.Steve from Collider was the first to definitely say the voice was Serkis. Still many remained skeptical. Harry Knowles from Ain\u2019t It Cool News even posted that he confirmed it was \"not\" Serkis, but that sentiment was quickly changed.Finally, Hitfix got on the case and bolstered Collider\u2019s earlier point:For the record, that is Andy Serkis you hear in the trailer. I was able to verify this, although I was not able to uncover any further information about the role he plays. Here\u2019s what I do know, though. He\u2019s playing a pivotal role in the film, although he will not have a lot of screen time.That\u2019s a very interesting piece of information. Does it make him an Emperor-like character? Possibly someone who\u2019ll play a larger role later in the series? You have to think, if Serkis\u2019 character can feel the event of the title \u2013 The Force Awakening \u2013 he\u2019s gotta be crucial. That\u2019s simply because not everyone can feel the Force. \"The Phantom Menace\" didn\u2019t play a huge role in that movie, but he sure did later on.Maybe you\u2019re still skeptical. Our own Dave Chen took a voice over performance from Cumberbatch and edited it back to back with this one, making it pretty obvious it\u2019s not that actor.So that\u2019s that.

However, Orlando wasn\u2019t the initial location that Walt considered for his second park. Plans had actually been drawn up in 1963 for an indoor theme park that was to be built in downtown St. Louis.Click here for the best restaurants at Disneyland Park.At the time, it made a lot of sense. Research showed that only five percent of Disneyland\u2019s guests traveled from east of the Mississippi River, despite the fact that 75 percent of America\u2019s population lived on that side of the country \u2014 and Walt desperately wanted the extra business. When the plans were drawn up, St. Louis was booming, the landmark Gateway Arch in St. Louis was under construction (it debuted in 1965), and Busch Stadium (est. 1966) was being built just a few blocks away.However, the would-be Missouri Disney World hit a few roadblocks. Anheuser-Busch beer baron August A. Busch Jr. (who ran much of the city) allegedly insisted that the theme park sell beer, which Walt refused to do in the name of a family-friendly environment.

According to dermatologist, Dr. Carl Thornfeldt, mint has a calming affect on inflamed skin and can also treat some skin infections. According to Dr. Thornfeldt, it has now been proven that spearmint is the most potent of the different mints when it comes to killing bacteria and yeasts. Patients who drank two cups of organic spearmint tea twice a day had a dramatic reduction in acne in just 3 months. Bonus? No side effects!Adult acne is caused by abnormal, excess inflammation that is seen in 68% of adult women by yeast and bacteria in the skin. Spearmint tea is effective due to its active ingredients\u2014flavonoids (anti-inflammatory), menthol (anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anti-yeast, anti-fungal and anti-viral effects), limonene (antibacterial, anti-yeast, anti-fungal and anti-viral effects) and rosmaric acids (antibacterial, anti-yeast, anti-fungal and anti-viral effects). Basically, a cup of tea works to against all of the things going on in your skin that could cause a breakout.So, grab a box of tea (loose leaf preferably) and bottoms up!", "answers": {"answer_start": [792], "text": ["spearmint tea"]}, "id": "4s5qf7"}, {"question": "Drinking Baileys in this country could mean you're gay -- and going to jail", "context": "A Cameroonian attorney says that one of his clients was convicted of \"feminine mannerisms\" for drinking Bailey's Irish Cream under his country's strict anti-gay laws.Attorney Michel Togue, who has defended many Cameroon residents who have been accused of homosexuality, tells ThinkProgress that very few of his clients were ever caught engaging in an actual same-sex act, as local police have made arrests based solely on how the individual is presented if an accusation has been made.If a man is employed as a hairdresser, he said, or found to be cross-dressing, those attributes could be used as evidence that the suspect is gay in a court of law.\"To catch people having sex, to catch them in the act, you have to break the law.

The acting was simple, clear, direct, and active\u2014the hallmarks of proficiency. \"How did it go?\" I asked.\"Fine,\" she squeezed.\"Did you do what you wanted to do?\" I probed.\"No, it wasn\u2019t true,\" she responded.After an improvisational acting exercise, she did a second take. My USC colleague Jack Rowe is often quick to note when an actor\u2019s performance changes the air in the room. This was one of those moments. My gut seized and breath shortened as she spoke each syllable. A new kind of quiet filled the studio. With each move she made and each word she uttered, she seemed to be embarking upon a hero\u2019s struggle, defying the gods for her sense of justice and peace. I felt a connection to the actors seated behind me and sensed I wasn\u2019t the only one with tears in my eyes. The actor performing was not crying.There was a long silence when she finished the monologue. The moment transformed and she looked at me. \"How did it go?\" I queried.\"Fine,\" she said. I was surprised by her response, so I used her barometer from earlier and asked, \"Was it true?\"She responded, \"I don\u2019t know. It was true for me but I don\u2019t know if some guy on the street would think it was true!\" The actor, who had succeeded at the highest levels of the art form\u2014reaching her audience, moving them, making them feel\u2014was deferring to a stranger on the street to measure her success.From the moment we\u2019re born, we\u2019re labeled good or bad\u2014by our parents and other adults, our teachers, our bosses, our spouses. It cycles, first validated or rejected by others, and then, as a result, seeking validation or rejection from others. Viola Spolin called this the Approval/Disapproval Syndrome, and it leads to creative paralysis.An actor\u2019s value is constantly billboarded as synonymous with red carpets, expensive minimalist clothing, and pharmaceutical endorsements. Even in training, you perform a scene in the typical acting class and then receive the teacher\u2019s critique about what was good or not. Regardless of the teacher\u2019s talent, they can perpetuate the approval/disapproval cycle that promotes dependency and prevents creative freedom. Choice is the province of the artist and the trained actor must be able to answer for themselves if they did what they wanted to do.Henri Matisse, the famous painter, was painting a model. A guest in his studio looked at the model, looked at the painting, then looked at Matisse and said, \"You got her arm wrong.\" Matisse looked at the model, smiled, and then gestured to the canvas and responded, \"You see my friend, this, is a painting.\"The knowledge of whether the artist did what they wanted to do is vital for the kind of collaboration required on film sets because it allows for a degree of objectivity. I once watched a generous director ask an actor if he was good with the last take and ready to move on. The actor thought for a moment and said, \"No, I wanna try something. Do we have time for one more take?\"Without the ability to answer the question, \"Did I do what I wanted to do?\" the actor would\u2019ve been the equivalent of a deferential child waiting for the director\u2019s approval to move on instead of a collaborator who was part of the whole, free and willing to take risks to capture just the right brush stroke.If an actor is able to set specific goals in a scene, then they can measure them. If you decide in a scene to work on subtext, for example, then ask yourself afterward, \"Did I do what I wanted to do, work on the subtext?\" Then you may evaluate your focus on the inner life of the scene and assess if the inner action colored the text in a way that is beautiful and true (or if you lost concentration and became distracted by something else).Regardless of the answer, you will have a qualitative measurement about the relationship of subtext to the scene (or your own ability to concentrate). Most importantly, you will be breaking the cycle of reading the reviews to determine how good you are, and instead possess the freedom to paint the world truly, as you see it.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1112], "text": ["Was it true?"]}, "id": "4lsyv7"}, {"question": "The happiest little accident.", "context": "Beyonce\u0301 might have given us the best pregnancy announcement of 2017, but this couple comes in pretty close with a tribute to everyone's favorite public television painter: Bob Ross.

Africa's most populous nation is home not only to the global Scrabble champion, but team Nigeria ranks as the world's top Scrabble playing nation \u2014 ahead of the U.S. in second place.The Scrabble world champion is The Scrabble world champion is Wellington Jighere . He's 33, has a soft voice, a slow smile and a penchant for fedoras, earning him the nickname \"the Cat in the Hat.\" Jighere acknowledges that he's taciturn by nature, but also has an explosive, infectious laugh, though he considers Scrabble is serious business.\"You can't afford to waste too much energy doing unnecessary chatter,\" he says. \"During a tournament, I see it as business time. And that is no time to be joking around.\" Jighere plays chess to relax, \"and for fun,\" he says.Jet-lagged and weary, Jighere was crowned the world Scrabble champ last year in a grueling 32-round competition in Australia. Up to 30 of the top 100 global players are from Nigeria, which has the highest percentage of any country in the top 200. The Nigerians' apparent collective strategy \u2014 short words that rack up the points.Nigerians have been credited with perfecting that tactic under the tutorship of senior team coach, Prince Anthony Ikolo. He says Nigerians are passionate about Scrabble and the short word method gives them an edge. Many put Nigeria's towering Scrabble prowess down to its players ability to \"choke the board\" as they say, with this defensive play.\" The game of Scrabble is actually built around short words \u2014 especially five letter words,\" says Ikolo. \"If you have such a word base, then you are good to go. But it would be a very big mistake for the world to think our players only know short words, especially five-letter words,\" he warns.The coach says \"the short words help you to be defensive [by blocking longer words from opponents], but when it's time to be offensive, we know those long words also. Nigeria is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to Scrabble,\" says Ikolo.Ikolo, who's also a university mathematician, came up with lists of five-letter words and distributed them to his players, including Jighere the world champion, to train them how to block the board. The coach says, armed with these, the Nigerians could take on and beat competitors playing seven-eight- or even nine-letter words.The other strategy was to gather his players at a hotel, before the tournament, and have them play two days of nonstop Scrabble. It appears to have worked.Jighere though says his personal strategy is to have \"no strategy at all. I play a fluid kind of game. Yah. I really don't have a particular kind of style that you can pin me to, \"he says. So, when you are expecting me to do the traditional thing, I will just choose to do something that is uncharacteristic. It's what sets me apart from everyone else.\"Jighere should know. He and team Nigeria triumphed at the Jighere should know. He and team Nigeria triumphed at the World English-Language Scrabble Players Association world championship in Australia in November 2015. They fully intend to hang onto that success when they defend those titles next year in Kenya, he says.Nigeria's president, Muhammadu Buhari, phoned Australia to congratulate him, says Jighere with a big smile. \"It felt so warm to have him speak with me right then and there. It was a very, very important experience. He told me how proud he is of my accomplishment and how proud I have made the nation as a whole, not just the nation but Africa as a whole. And that it has really gone to prove that we are truly the giants of Africa.\"Jighere bested a Briton in Perth, while Team Nigeria dethroned the U.S., which had been at the pinnacle for about decade, with Nigeria yapping at its heels, determined to topple the Americans.\"We are currently ranked No. 1 nation in the world for Scrabble,\" says the champ. \"In the world we have the highest number of persons in the top 100 rated Scrabble players. We have as many as 20 to 30 tough masters in Nigeria that can really give you a tough fight any time any day.\"Ikolo, the coach, will attest to that. Jighere's friends and fellow Scrabble masters cut him no slack, in the jovial, noisy and garrulous atmosphere during the Lagos tournament.Ikolo gleefully told NPR that, until the Nigeria National Scrabble Players competition, in the main city Lagos, at the tail end of July, Jighere had failed to win any significant tournament after his success in Australia last year.\"Since he became the world champion, he has been beaten blue and black by his colleagues. It tells you how strong Nigeria's Scrabble is. It tells you that the Scrabble scene we have here is a very tough one. It's highly competitive and nobody can boast tomorrow that I'm going to win this, I'm going to win that when it comes to Nigerian Scrabble playing.\"So why Scrabble? \"Ah, I didn't exactly choose Scrabble,\" says Jightere. \"I ran into some friends who were tournament players and I beat them. They told me 'Ah, if I could do this well against them, that means I should come to the next tournament.' \" He adds, \"And I was like, \"Ah, you mean they play this in tournaments? OK, let's go. And the rest, as they say, is history.\" And he laughs.That was in 2002. Today, Jighere sits atop the global Scrabble tournament ladder. He describes how he had to overcome fatigue and jet lag to win in Australia. Learn those words, commit them to memory and stay cool \u2013 and awake.Scrabble was given official recognition as a sport in Nigeria in the 1990s. But local players, coaches, parents, officials and tournament organizers say government assistance has been patchy and more must be done to support, sponsor and finance Scrabble.\"Why will the government and corporate firms not look the way of Scrabble?\" laments coach Okolo. \"Government and corporate firms should come to the aid of Scrabble.\"The Lagos State government provided the venue \u2014 Teslim Balogun stadium for indoor sports \u2014 for the recent tournament, as well as organizing some logistics.But senior team coach Ikolo says while cash prizes are welcome, the authorities \u2014 and corporate sponsors \u2014 should do more to capitalize on Nigeria's global success at Scrabble. \"We don't value that Nigeria is ranked the best Scrabble playing nation in the world,\" says Ikolo, \"and we have the world Scrabble champion, Wellington Jighere.\"Enlarge this image Angela \"I'm not very shy!\" Osaigbovo, 10, of Nigeria came in second in a recent youth tournament, and triumphed at Scrabble camp in August.

The figure includes all residents, regardless of immigration status.The densely-populated county's growth has inched along in recent years at an under 1-percent clip, particularly slowing during the recession. In past years, the department had even estimated it had already hit 10 million, only to revise the figures later as growth was found to have slowed more than expected.But analysts say finally hitting the milestone serves to highlight just what a powerful political and economic engine the Los Angeles region represents. It has more people than 43 states, and on its own would be the 88th most populous country in the world, ahead of Sweden or Austria, for example.\"It's impressive,\" said Tom Hogen-Esch, a political science professor at Cal State Northridge. \"We're one of the largest political entities in the U.S. and our budget ...would make us one of the largest countries in the world.\"Bill Schooling, the Department of Finance's chief of demographic research said \"it appears very likely\" that the new estimate of at least 10 million will hold up over time because of the state's economic growth, although 19,000 residents above the 10 million threshold do technically fall within the margin of error.Regardless of these estimates, Los Angeles County officials said they have long operated on the notion that at least 10 million people have been living here, county spokesman David Sommers said.\"We believe there is a large element of our population that gets missed in counts,\" Sommers said. \"In terms of social services we provide and critical safety-net services the county is responsible for -- providing care and providing services to a level of the population that has nowhere else to turn -- we know we have a very large base and we believe that base to be over 10 million people. It's nice to see that validation from the state.\"L.A. County has seen relatively \"strong growth\" now for two consecutive years for a county of its size, Schooling said. It saw a 0.75 percent increase in population between July 2012 and July 2013 and a 0.85 percent increase the year before, compared with 0.36 percent three years ago, according to state estimates. San Bernardino County, still reeling from the effects of the recession, is also growing but at a slower rate than neighboring Los Angeles and Riverside counties.\"L.A's been growing at a fairly decent clip for the last couple of years,\" Schooling said. \"If you went back to the worst of the (housing) bubble, you would see a much smaller growth. As recently as the 2010-11 period, it was half the rate of (the current) increase.\"\"I think the improving economy is a lot of it, jobs being added and we're also seeing a significant amount of natural increase in L.A. -- more births than deaths,\" which has been the case for many years, Schooling said.Not only is California a highly desirable place to live, the state also has a higher-than-average birth rate due largely to its slightly younger population and a greater share of immigrants, who tend to have more children than U.S.-born women, said Christopher Thornberg, founding partner of L.A.-based Beacon Economics.But local experts argue that the overall population growth in L.A. County has still been relatively slow. Typically, the population in the county and the state grows at a faster rate than the nation. However, the state and the L.A. Metropolitan area slipped into a much more severe recession than the nation as a whole, which reversed that trend, said Robert Kleinhenz, chief economist at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.California saw a population growth rate of about 0.9 percent this year compared to last year while the national rate is about the same.\"The fact that the local economy is lagging in its recovery compared to the state, compared to the nation, I think is having an adverse impact on our net migration and our overall population growth rate,\" Kleinhenz said. \"As the local economy improves next year, which is what we expect, we'll probably see some acceleration in net migration and the decision to have children.\"L.A. County grew the most in 1986 when it saw an increase of 182,228 people over the previous year. This year, there was an estimated increase of 74,000 people over 2012, Schooling said.Contributing to the growth is that the number of births has exceeded the number of deaths in L.A. County by more than 70,000 people a year in recent years. Immigration is also driving the population increase. While many people move from the Los Angeles area to other parts of the state, relatively high rates of immigration counterbalances that, Schooling said.In the last two years, more people have moved into L.A. County than out of it but that wasn't the case three years ago and during the housing crisis, Schooling said.Meanwhile, in San Bernardino County, the population grew by nearly 0.6 percent this year to an estimated 2.08 million people. More people have been leaving the county than coming into it for years and it lost more than 6,000 people in 2013 to net migration.\"San Bernardino hasn't completely grown out of the economic doldrums yet,\" Schooling said. \"I think they are working on it. They are still growing but we haven't seen the huge growth in the Inland Empire that we have seen in previous times yet.\" ___", "answers": {"answer_start": [41], "text": ["Los Angeles"]}, "id": "411549772915298304"}, {"question": "Players discover major change in Pokemon Go after hitting level 20", "context": "Players discover major change in Pokemon Go after hitting level 20Poke\u0301mon GO players have been leveling up steadily since the game\u2019s release, and it appears that there is currently a level cap of 40 in the popular mobile game.

Yet the movie remains a financial triumph almost entirely owed to its showing in China, where cinema-goers have so far shelled out more than $200 million on it, even eclipsing Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which took $125.4 million in its entire run in China.Movie experts hail Warcraft\u2019s success as demonstrating the power of China\u2019s booming cinema. Box office revenues grew by almost 50% in China last year and may even surpass the U.S. by as early as next year. There are plans afoot to double the nation\u2019s 35,000 cinema screens before long. (The U.S. currently has just over 40,000.)This trend has the potential to radically reshape how Hollywood operates. But while there is no denying the burgeoning power of Chinese film fans, assessing Warcraft\u2019s success requires more nuance. Just like in the U.S., the movie dropped off massively after its opening \u2014 netting $156 million over its first five days and the next $40 million-odd over spread over more than a week. That suggests that the Warcraft movie may not have broad appeal among Chinese; instead, its success appears to be largely owed to the nation\u2019s sizeable and dedicated gamer following.\"I have watch the Warcraft movie five times, and I will never forget my obsession and my friends who fought by my side in Warcraft,\" posted one user of China\u2019s Twitter-like microblog Weibo. \"I had fun, also lost myself in World of Warcraft.

WoW is so popular that there are professional players who are treated like movie stars, complete with sponsorship deals with fawning groupies. There are Chinese boot camps set up especially for kids who suffer from role-player game addiction.This obsession with role-playing escapism could have much to do with the highly regimented lives led by middle-class Chinese kids, who cope with enormous pressure.

However, even though this ride isn\u2019t actually open yet, technical rehearsals have been going on in the past few days, which have given a lucky few an advance look at this attractionInterestingly, praise for the attraction on a technical level has been near universal (no pun intended), with many lauding the attraction\u2019s amazing King Kong animatronic (which you can learn more about here). However, there was one issue that has been causing a lot of controversy in the theme park community: the queue. Now something as simple as a line might not seem like such a big cause for issue, but there\u2019s one big thing that will separate this line from any other at an Orlando theme park....Editor\u2019s note: some elements of the Skull Island: Reign of Kong queue are discussed here, so if you want to experience this attraction completely unspoiled, turn back now!There will be scareactors in the queueAnyone who has ever been to Halloween Horror Nights knows all about scareactors, who roam the streets of Universal Studios Florida and hang out in haunted mazes waiting for the perfect time to jump out and give guests a fright. And while this type of guest interaction was previously confined to Halloween Horror Nights, it looks like guests who enter the interior part of the Skull Island: Reign of Kong queue will be subjected to some \"natives\" of Skull Island that will be hidden at strategic points in the queue and will be surprising unsuspecting guests.This is certainly an interesting development for a number of reasons. First of all, this will be the closest thing to a year round haunt Universal Orlando Resort has ever had. Interestingly, west coast counterpart Universal Studios Hollywood had a year round haunt with Universal\u2019s House of Horrors for over a decade before that attraction closed down in 2014 and it will have another year round haunt later this year when The Walking Dead attraction opens. However, this will be a first for Orlando.Another reason why this new addition is especially noteworthy is it continues Universal\u2019s recent trend of making queues a legitimate part of the attraction they are placed in front of. Back in 2010 when Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey opened, guests were stunned by the Hogwarts castle queue, and to this day guests who prefer not to ride the attraction can request a \"Castle Tour\" just so they can see the queue.Though this development sounds great on the surface, there are some that are wary of this change, for some very legitimate reasons", "answers": {"answer_start": [694], "text": ["the queue"]}, "id": "4mzyqo"}, {"question": "Congressman busted for cocaine voted for drug testing food stamp recipients", "context": "WASHINGTON -- In September, Rep.

In October, police busted the Florida Republican on a charge of cocaine possession.\"It\u2019s really interesting it came on the heels of Republicans voting on everyone who had access to food stamps get drug tested,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told BuzzFeed Tuesday. \"It\u2019s like, what?\"The House over the summer approved an amendment by Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) that would let states drug test people on food stamps. The amendment passed by voice vote, meaning members' individual yeas and nays were not recorded. Radel later voted in favor of a broader food stamps bill that included Hudson's measure.In support of his drug testing legislation, Hudson cited the many state legislatures around the country that had considered similar requirements for other means-tested programs in recent years.\"This is a clear and obvious problem in our communities as nearly 30 states have introduced legislation to drug test for welfare programs,\" Hudson said. \"We have a moral obligation to equip the states with the tools they need to discourage the use of illegal drugs.\"Most of the state legislation was authored by Republicans. Oftentimes, state Democrats responded by suggesting lawmakers should be subject to tests as well. If the government's going to make sure recipients of taxpayer-funded benefits are clean, the argument went, then why not also make sure the recipients of taxpayer salaries are clean, too?In June, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) made that very suggestion when he questioned why recipients of crop insurance and other government benefits weren't also targeted for drug tests like people on food stamps.\"Why don't we drug test all the members of Congress here,\" McGovern said shortly before the drug-testing measure passed. \"Force everybody to go urinate in a cup or see whether or not anybody is on drugs? Maybe that will explain why some of these amendments are coming up or why some of the votes are turning out the way they are.\"The fate of the food stamp drug testing provision is in the hands of a House-Senate conference committee hashing out differences between food stamp and farm legislation that passed the two chambers.

On the evening of August 31st, however, most of us were experiencing nothing but serious connection issues. Within hours of launch, the open beta of Battlefield 1 was KIA by crippling server issues across all platforms. These lasted for around 10 hours and left many unable to connect into the game at all. This, on top of all the problems we encountered once we were finally able to get into the game, has left us (and I\u2019m sure many others) wondering whether DICE and EA are in danger of repeating the same mistakes that led Battlefield 4\u2019s infamously rocky launch.After just two hours of playtime in the Battlefield 1 beta, I\u2019d already encountered dozens of technical problems and glitches, both big and small. At one point, the vehicle that myself and my squad were driving in suddenly just disappeared, leaving us stranded and bewildered, looking at one another in complete shock over what had just occurred. Battlefield 1 also suffers from that classic Battlefield problem of everything feeling slightly out of sync, with delayed responses for grenades (among other things) and sprinting often feeling as though you\u2019re attached held back by a giant bungie cable. With every DICE game, I always think to myself \"next time, they\u2019ll definitely have the resources to ensure that everything work.\" But truth be told, the beta for Battlefield 1 honestly hasn\u2019t left me in high hopes.So that\u2019s the worst stuff out of the way. With regards to pure gameplay, Battlefield 1 is something of a mixed bag. The sound design looks set to be the best it\u2019s ever been; bullets whizz and crack when they fly past your ears, your fellow soldiers scream commands with audible fear, and vehicles roar as they steamroll into battle. Together, it all helps in building a genuine sense of intensity and scale to the combat. While the visuals fail to impress quite as spectacularly as that of DICE\u2019s last title, Star Wars Battlefront, the game\u2019s still a clear frontrunner for the best looking shooter of this holiday season. With open, flat plains and a general lack of visual diversity to it, the Sinai Desert map available in the beta is unlikely to become a series favourite. Here\u2019s hoping that DICE have some more exciting environments in store for the game\u2019s full release.The gunplay itself is spiced up by the World War I era the game is set in. We\u2019re treated to a variety of early 20thcentury weapons that provide something of a challenge wrought by the limitations of the time. Sniper rifles, in particular, lack the precision or range of those from the modern age of Battlefield 4, but learning to use them and scoring a headshot feels much more gratifying as a result.There are a number of new features that DICE have brought to Battlefield 1 too, but these tend to be hit-or-miss as well. Horses feel weirdly clunky to ride or score any kills from, and spawning into airborne planes without being able to take off, as was the case in Battlefront, can make the air combat feel like it\u2019s completely separate from the ground war at times. The added ability to charge at foes with your bayonet injects some much needed viability to the melee kills, and also works as a strategic way to cover ground more quickly. In addition, the new \"behemoth\" vehicles, which \u2013 in the Sinai Desert \u2013 is a fully weaponized train, can act as genuine game changers, ensuring that the momentum against the losing team never accelerates too far.DICE and EA have only a little bit of time to iron out the pretty noticeable kinks of Battlefield 1 before its October 21strelease date, but we\u2019re undoubtedly excited by the prospect of the game\u2019s potential. That potential, at least in the beta, however, is severely hampered by a number of practical issues that could be the game\u2019s undoing.

That\u2019s why Howard Hughes spent 1935 risking his life flying experimental planes to break speed barriers and why he took even graver risks in 1938 to fly around the world in record time. Hughes had everything to lose\u2014fame, fortune, beautiful girlfriends, some might say his mind\u2014and yet he needed to know what his machines could do.In the decades that followed, crisscrossing the globe turned from a daredevil feat into a regular occurrence. The jet engine had made its way out of the labs and into daily life. These new engines were far more powerful than propellers and allowed airplanes to travel faster and farther and\u2014crucially\u2014to do so reliably. Hughes, Pan Am\u2019s Juan Trippe, and others were quick to seize on the opportunity and built airline empires. The military began ordering fighter jets by the tens of thousands, and companies such as General Electric rushed to meet the demand.By the 1960s this one invention had shrunk the world. For the first time the entire surface of the planet was reachable\u2014or at least viewable\u2014and its wonders opened up. Food, art, leisure, commerce, and relationships were redefined. Life became richer and more hectic. Jet travel created true global citizens while also making it easier to conduct war and spread disease.And yet for all the changes the jet engine brought about, it\u2019s remarkable how static the technology has become. Militaries have developed engines that can break the speed of sound, but the public has benefited little from such work. The Concorde came and went. Boeing spent more than $32 billion to build the 787, which is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than its predecessor but not much faster. GE is filling its engines with sensors and software in the hope of wringing another percentage point of performance here and there. Figures such as Hughes and Trippe have been replaced by low-cost airline execs like Ryanair\u2019s Michael O\u2019Leary, who test the limits of what humans will tolerate rather than what humans can achieve. Some of this is physics, but surely some of it is complacency, too.The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.The good news is that there are still people pushing boundaries. Some companies are looking at ways to revive Concorde-type jets and upgrade them with see-through cabins. Elon Musk, the SpaceX and Tesla Motors chief executive officer, wants to build an all-electric supersonic plane that can take off and land vertically.

Clothes, particularly hard-to-fit items like pants or bras, are difficult to buy online without trying them on first.So several websites, including Qvit.com, are trying to fix that by making the online shopping process as close to the in-store shopping process as possible. Qvit.com's unique development is the use of personalized avatars, allowing shoppers to \"try on\" clothes on an avatar resembling their exact bodies so they can see how the garments will look and even feel.The idea, says co-founder Laura Pastrana, came when she was in college. Dorming with a \"shopaholic\" friend who \"ordered and returned, ordered and returned everything she bought,\" Laura and her friends couldn't believe there wasn't a better way to see how clothing fit before ordering them online.\"We wanted to have a figure that replicated your body and that allows you to try garments on yourself, so like a virtual you, to see how a garment fits,\" Pastrana said in an interview with HuffPost Style. After years of development, in 2013 they finally came up with an avatar, a custom replica of the shopper's body, that allows her to try clothes in three different ways:1. \"Mirror Image\" Gives the shopper a straightforward reflection of exactly what she looks like in the clothes, down to her customizable skin color.2. \"Transparency\" Makes the clothes see-through so the shopper can see how closely or baggily they lay on her body.3. \"The Heat Map\" Shows how tightly or loosely a garment fits with colors not unlike topography (red means \"so tight you can barely breathe,\" blue means \"there is more than one inch between the item and your body\").The beauty of a customizable avatar, says Pastrana, is that it doesn't rely on predetermined body \"types\" so often used to guide women's shopping choices, i.e. if you're pear-shaped, buy this; if you're ruler-shaped, buy this. \"We're not looking for what designers believe is the perfect fit,\" Pastrana told HuffPost Style. \"We're rather looking for more of a desired fit, i.e. how I want to take it or how I want to wear it, how it reflects my lifestyle or my look or even my mood.\" She added, \"Sometimes, we women go 'Today I feel fat' or 'I feel ugly, so I want something more loose.'

If you need one of these ASAP, it's completely understandable: here's where to buy the Gabby Douglas Barbie before they're gone.Douglas is only 20 years old, but she's already got a huge (and growing) fan club.

It has made dolls of ballet dancer Misty Copeland, filmmaker Ava DuVernay, and actress Emmy Rossum, according to the Huffington Post. Douglas will join this motley crew with her own, lifelike \"Shero\" doll. Douglas seems pretty thrilled about the development (who wouldn't be?). She took to Twitter on Monday morning to announce the news. She wrote, \"Excited to debut my @Barbie Shero doll! Let\u2019s continue to break barriers & dream big, girls!\"In the photo she posted, Douglas is at the gym with her Shero doll. They're wearing identical track suits (the doll's is smaller) and she's posing her doll on a to-scale balance beam. It's pretty adorable. When she spoke with People, she expressed how honored she was to be memorialized in Barbie form. She said, \"I\u2019m so excited. My older sister and I used to play with Barbies and create these dramatic fantasy stories, so it\u2019s such a huge honor.\" Mattel circulated a video interview with Douglas on its Twitter feed that also captured her excitement.

Nor will it amaze, stun, delight, shock, charm, or in any literal or figurative way, blow your mind. What it will do\u2014hopefully in a clear and intelligent way\u2014is explain why people continually fall for clickbait. You know, like you just did a few seconds ago.Whether you think it\u2019s on the rise, obscurant and self-negating, not such a big deal, or the root of all evil, one thing is clear about clickbait: It\u2019s increasingly hard to pin down. Some, like Buzzfeed\u2019s Ben Smith, narrowly define it as an article that doesn\u2019t deliver on its headline\u2019s promise. Others think it means vapid listicles, quizzes, and Betteridge\u2019s Law headlines. And then there are those who simply use it as shorthand for stuff they don\u2019t like on the Internet.Here\u2019s what most people can agree on: Clickbait is annoying, but by god, it works\u2014even when readers recognize it for what it is. The word\u2019s substantial semantic drift may be behind some of this effectiveness. But a hefty helping of behavioral science is at play, too. As a number of new studies confirm, you can blame your clickbait habit on two things: the outsized role emotion plays in your intuitive judgements and daily choices, and your lazy brain.Manufacturing EmotionClickbait doesn\u2019t just happen on its own. Editors write headlines in an effort to manipulate you\u2014or at least grab your attention\u2014and always have. \"Headless Body In Topless Bar,\" and \"Sticks Nix Hick Pix\" wouldn\u2019t exist if publications didn\u2019t care about attracting eyeballs. The difference with clickbait is you\u2019re often aware of this manipulation, and yet helpless to resist it. It\u2019s at once obvious in its bait-iness, and somehow still effective bait.This has a lot to do with emotion and the role it plays in our daily decision-making processes, says Jonah Berger, who studies social influence and contagion at the University of Pennsylvania. Emotional arousal, or the degree of physical response you have to an emotion, is a key ingredient in clicking behaviors. Sadness and anger, for example, are negative emotions, but anger is much more potent. \"It drives us, fires us up, and compels us to take action,\" Berger says. If you\u2019ve ever found yourself falling for outrage clickbait or spent time hate-reading and hate-watching something, you know what Berger is talking about. \"Anger, anxiety, humor, excitement, inspiration, surprise\u2014all of these are punchy emotions that clickbait headlines rely on,\" he says.A growing body of research supports this idea. In a recent paper called \"Breaking the News: First Impressions Matter On Online News,\" two researchers looked at 69,907 headlines produced by four international media outlets in 2014. After analyzing the sentiment polarity of these headlines (whether the primary emotion conveyed was positive, negative, or neutral), they found \"an extreme sentiment score obtained the largest mean popularity.\" This not only suggests that strongly negative or strongly positive news tends to attract more readers, they concluded, but also that \"a headline has more chance to [receive clicks] if the sentiment expressed in its text is extreme, towards the positive or the negative side.\"Mind the Curiosity GapPromising a hilarious or mind-blowing experience using hyperbole and superlatives (even when the subject clearly doesn\u2019t warrant such language) is one way to attract clicks. Another is to provoke curiosity. Upworthy articles are particularly good at this and psychologists have a few theories why.One of the more popular and enduring ones comes from Carnegie Mellon\u2019s George Loewenstein. In the mid-1990s, Loewenstein came up with what he called the \"information-gap\" theory. It basically holds that whenever we perceive a gap \"between what we know and what we want to know,\" that gap has emotional consequences. \"Such information gaps produce the feeling of deprivation labeled curiosity,\" he wrote. \"The curious individual is motivated to obtain the missing information to reduce or eliminate the feeling of deprivation.\"In other words, not knowing is cognitively uncomfortable. Historically, this is the thinking behind Upworthy-style \"what happens next\" headlines: \"Someone Gave Some Kids Some Scissors. Here\u2019s What Happened Next\" or \"These Workers Just Want Money, And You Won\u2019t Believe What They Did To Get Some.\" You can make people even more curious, say social psychologists, by presenting them with something they know a little bit about, but not too much.Numbers and ListsUmberto Eco famously claimed that humans are drawn to lists because we\u2019re afraid to die. Psychologists agree. Sort of. As many studies show, lists do a number of things extremely well from a cognitive standpoint, including helping us \"face infinity and attempt to grasp the incomprehensible.\" Here\u2019s a brief list of reasons list headlines are so effective:They often use numbers, and numbers stand out when we\u2019re scrolling through an endless stream of headlines\u2014particularly odd numbers. Those numbers also help quantify story length and hint at the amount of attention (not much) we\u2019ll need to deploy to read the story. They organize information spatially, which is how our brains like information. They feel good, existentially, because they eliminate (or at least downplay) the \"paradox of choice,\" presenting in its stead the illusion of certainty.The takeaway here is that lists ultimately help create an easier reading (and thinking) experience. And there are few things your brain appreciates more than cognitive ease. As Kahneman writes, \"easy is a sign that things are going well\u2014no threats, no major news, no need to redirect attention or mobilize effort.\" \"The 15 Reasons Why You Can\u2019t Resist List Headlines\" promises a pre-defined endpoint and makes the world seem comprehensible. Lists banish mental heavy lifting, complexity, and ambiguity. Click.Anticipation Is Making You ClickSo clickbait employs a number of effective cognitive tricks to get clicks. Fine. But even if readers rely on emotion and cognitive ease when choosing headlines, that still doesn\u2019t explain why clickbait continues to work. Fool-me-once logic should mean that their effectiveness goes down as exposure goes up. How many cheap emotional ploys, false promises, and empty listicles and quizzes can a person endure? A lot, it turns out.Research has shown that humans are quite willing to put up with massive amounts of disappointment and frustration so long as there\u2019s an occasional payout. And yes, sometimes clickbait does deliver these payouts ... in spectacular fashion.Consider the following headline: \"These 9 Unlikely Animal BFFs Will Brighten Your Day and Melt Your Heart.\" There are hundreds of variations of it online\u2014many of them better from a clickbait POV\u2014but you get the idea. We\u2019re talking baby wombats hugging baby kangaroos, maybe some tiny snow leopard kittens playing with fox cubs, that sort of thing.It\u2019s well established that humans are pre-programmed cute seekers. To our brains\u2019 pleasure centers, there\u2019s little difference between looking at cute animals and consuming sugar or having sex. Indeed, the same neurotransmitter, dopamine, is involved in all three behaviors. That dopamine can manipulate our behavior isn\u2019t news. But the chronology of this process is important when you\u2019re trying to decode clickbait\u2019s effectiveness.Think of those nine adorable animal pics as a reward (your brain certainly does). Now think of that clickbait headline as a signal, an imminent sign you\u2019re about to see some super-adorbz animal buddies. Lastly, think of the actual clicking of the link as the work you have to do to get that outcome. See headline, click hyperlink, receive super-cute reward. Easy.You might assume our brains get that wonderful squirt of dopamine after we get the reward (the pics), but it turns out dopamine levels go up much sooner\u2014when we see the signal. That effectively means the headline itself is what gave you pleasure\u2014not for what it was, mind you, but for what it represented (impending cuteness in 3...2...1).Stanford neuroscientist Robert Sopolsky summarizes the finding this way: \"Dopamine is not about pleasure; it\u2019s about the anticipation of pleasure. It\u2019s about the pursuit of happiness rather than happiness itself.\"Happiness in SlaveryWhat\u2019s really interesting is what happens when you reduce the reward frequency. When it comes only 50 percent of the time, dopamine levels go through the roof. In this sense, a violated promise isn\u2019t a deterrent for clicking behavior, but rather an incentive. As Sopolsky says, \"you\u2019ve just introduced the word \u2018maybe\u2019 into the equation, and maybe is addictive like nothing else out there.\" Psychologists call this intermittent reinforcement, and it basically means that one of the most effective ways to get a specific behavior out of a person is to introduce \"perhaps\" into the equation.Now obviously not all clickbait can\u2014or even attempts to\u2014manipulate our dopamine levels. But given its involvement in emotional arousal, it\u2019s fair to say it does factor. This complicates the overpromise/underdeliver argument many people use to predict clickbait\u2019s waning effectiveness. Indeed, on a rational level you may know that the adorable girl in this Clickhole video is right: you\u2019ll still feel alone no matter how many videos you watch or how many lists you read.

(Dani Johnson, Amy King / The Washington Post)I HAVE a habit that horrifies most people. I watch television and films in fast forward. This has become increasingly easy to do with computers (I\u2019ll show you how) and the time savings are enormous. Four episodes of \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\" fit into an hour. An entire season of \"Game of Thrones\" goes down on the bus ride from D.C. to New York.I started doing this years ago to make my life more efficient. Between trendy Web shows, auteur cable series, and BBC imports, there\u2019s more to watch than ever before. Some TV execs worry that the industry is outpacing its audience. A record-setting 412 scripted series ran in 2015, nearly double the number in 2009.\"There is simply too much television,\" FX Networks CEO John Landgraf said last year. Nonsense, responded Netflix content chief Ted Sarandos, who has been commissioning shows at a startling rate. \"There\u2019s no such thing as too much TV,\" he said.So here we are, spending three hours a day on average, scrambling to keep up with the Kardashians, the Starks, the Underwoods, and the dozens of others on the roster of must-watch TV, which has exploded in the age of fragmented audiences. Nowadays, to stay on the same wavelength with your different groups of friends \u2014 the ones hating on \"Meat Chad\" and the ones cooing over Khaleesi \u2014 you have to watch in bulk.This is where the trick of playing videos at 1.5x to 2x comes in \u2014 the latest twist in the millennia-old tradition of technology changing storytelling. The concept should be familiar to many. For years, podcast and audiobook players have provided speedup options, and research shows that most people prefer listening to accelerated speech.In recent years, software has made it much easier to perform the same operation on videos. This was impossible for home viewers in the age of VHS. But computers can now easily speed up any video you throw at them. You can play DVDs and iTunes purchases at whatever tempo you like. YouTube allows you select a speedup factor on its player. And a Google engineer has written a popular Chrome extension that accelerates most other Web videos, including on Netflix, Vimeo and Amazon Prime.Over 100,000 people have downloaded that plug-in, and the reviews are ecstatic. \"Oh my God! I regret all the wasted time I've lived before finding this gem!!\" one user wrote.But speeding up video is more than an efficiency hack. I quickly discovered that acceleration makes viewing more pleasurable. \"Modern Family\" played at twice the speed is far funnier \u2014 the jokes come faster and they seem to hit harder. I get less frustrated at shows that want to waste my time with filler plots or gratuitous violence. The faster pace makes it easier to appreciate the flow of the plot and the structure of the scenes.Wonkblog writer Jeff Guo watches all his television shows at 160% speed. This clip from ABC's Modern Family will give you an idea of what that looks like. (ABC)As I\u2019ve come to consume all my television on my computer, I\u2019ve developed other habits, too. I don't watch linearly anymore; I often scrub back and forth to savor complex scenes or to skim over slow ones. In other words, I watch television like I read a book. I jump around. I re-read. Sometimes I speed up. Sometimes I slow down.I confess these new viewing techniques have done something strange to my sense of reality. I can\u2019t watch television in real-time anymore. Movie theaters feel suffocating. I need to be able to fast-forward and rewind and accelerate and slow down, to be able to parcel my attention where it's needed. The most common objection I hear is that this ruins the cinematic experience. Annette Insdorf, a film professor at Columbia, told me: \"Sometimes watching a movie is like lovemaking: Isn't a sustained seduction more gratifying than momentary thrills?\"But the more I've learned about the history and the science of media consumption, the more I've come to believe this is the future of how we will appreciate television and movies. We will interrogate videos in new ways using our powers of time manipulation. Maybe not everyone will watch on fast-forward like I do, but we will all be watching on our own terms.In a way, what's happening to video recalls what happened to literature when we stopped reading aloud, together, and started reading silently, alone. Beginning in the Middle Ages, people no longer had to gather in groups to hear tales or learn the news or study religion. They could be alone with a text and their own thoughts, an unprecedented freedom that led to political and religious turmoil and forever changed intellectual life.With computers, video consumption is also becoming a solitary, self-paced act \u2014 and maybe a more analytical act, as well. If you believe, as I do, in the artistic potential of television and film, then perhaps we are on the brink of another cultural transformation \u2014 viewers finally seizing control of this medium. And the medium will be better for it.FOR a very long time, life was limited by the rate at which we spoke. Although we have had writing systems for millennia, early texts were designed to be read aloud, meaning that literature unfolded at the pace of human speech.Many ancient Greek and Roman documents, for instance, lacked punctuation, spaces or lowercase letters, making it challenging for people to understand them without sounding out the words syllable by syllable. \"A written text was essentially a transcription which, like modern musical notation, became an intelligible message only when it was performed orally to others or to oneself,\" historian Paul Saenger writes.There are physical limits to how quickly we can form sounds, as anyone who has attempted a tongue-twister can attest. Mouths need time to move into position for the next vowel or consonant. A good estimate for the natural rate of speech in English is 200 to 300 syllables per minute, which translates into 150 to 200 words per minute.According to Audible, the audiobook company, the typical book recording is performed at 155 wpm. A 1990 study found that radio broadcasts run at 160 wpm on average, while everyday conversations, which use shorter words, occur at about 210 wpm.For much of human history, this was the sound barrier for communicating ideas.It\u2019s not that silent reading was impossible in antiquity. It was just very difficult. There exist tales of scholars who seemed to absorb books silently; in the fourth century, Saint Augustine told of an odd monk who read without forming the words with his mouth. \"When he read,\" Augustine wrote, \"his eyes scanned the page and his heart sought out the meaning, but his voice was silent and his tongue was still.\"Historians debate whether these silent readers were regarded as freaks or the practice was merely unusual. Reading was still a group activity in the fifth and sixth centuries. One person read aloud while others listened. Even for scribes who copied manuscripts in solitude, the act of reading was intertwined with the act of speaking. Many early medieval monks who had taken vows of silence were still allowed to mumble as they read, Saenger writes, because mumbling was considered part of the reading process.During the Middle Ages, scribes began introducing spacing and punctuation into texts, which made silent reading much easier for everyone. The practice began in monasteries around the 10th century and slowly spread to university libraries a few hundred years later, and finally to the European aristocracy by the 14th and 15th centuries, according to historian Roger Chartier.The technique of silent, solitary reading released people from the sluggishness of the spoken word \u2014 as well as from the judgment of their peers. Reading in private gave people room to engage with a text, the freedom to think critically and sometimes heretically. Opinions too controversial for group reading could be disseminated and consumed in private. The result, historians say, was an intellectual, scientific \u2014 and spiritual \u2014 blossoming in Europe.\"Silent, secret, private reading paved the way for previously unthinkable audacities,\" Chartier writes. \"In the late Middle Ages, even before the invention of the printing press, heretical texts circulated in manuscript form, critical ideas were expressed, and erotic books, suitably illuminated, enjoyed considerable success.\"Chartier called silent reading the \"other revolution\" \u2014 together with the printing press and mass literacy, these developments created both the demand and the supply for a vast quantity of writing. The faster pace of silent reading accelerated the spread of new ideas and vaulted Western society toward religious and political schism.\"This \u2018privatization\u2019 of reading is undeniably one of the major cultural developments of the early modern era,\" Chartier argued.WHAT silent reading also revealed was that the rate of human thought far outstrips the rate of human speech.Broadcasters speak at about 160 wpm, but college students can comfortably devour a text at 300 wpm, which also seems to be the most efficient speed for reading comprehension, on average.Some people, of course, read slower, and others read much, much faster. The beauty of text is that we absorb it at our own pace. Not so for audiovisual recordings, at least not for much of the 20th century. If you play back a tape or a phonograph record too quickly, the voices turn squeaky and unintelligible. Recordings remained difficult to skim until the 1950s, when researchers made a set of discoveries about human speech.It turns out that sounds of the spoken word are vastly redundant. Vowels and consonants drag on longer than necessary for us to understand them. In the late 1940s, Harvard researchers discovered they could cover up more than half of a speech recording without damaging a listener\u2019s comprehension. The trick was to rapidly mute and unmute the audio. These silent gaps were brief enough that people\u2019s minds could fill them in easily. Words sounded choppy, but they remained perfectly intelligible.\"It is much like seeing a landscape through a picket fence,\" the researchers wrote. \"The pickets interrupt the view at regular intervals, but the landscape is perceived as continuing behind the pickets.\"The Harvard researchers rapidly muted and unmuted audio recordings. The top picture shows the original sound wave. The bottom picture shows the resulting sound wave, which has silent bits. Even though half of the sound wave has been destroyed, the researchers found that people could still understand it. (Miller and Licklider, 1950.)A team of engineers at the University of Illinois soon had another idea: Instead of leaving the gaps in, why not cut them out and stitch the remaining slivers of audio together? For instance, deleting every other millisecond of audio would cause the recording to play in half the time. This new way of speeding up sound, which became known as the sampling method, had the benefit of not making people sound like chipmunks.In the 1960s, a blind psychologist named Emerson Foulke began experimenting with this technique to accelerate speech. A professor at the University of Louisville, Foulke was frustrated with the slowness of recorded books for the blind, so he tried speeding them up. The sampling method proved surprisingly effective. In Foulke\u2019s experiments, speech could be accelerated to 250-275 wpm without affecting people\u2019s scores on a listening comprehension test.These limits were suspiciously close to the average college reading rate. Foulke suspected that beyond 300 wpm, deeper processes in the brain were getting overloaded. Experiments showed that at 300-400 wpm, individual words were still clear enough to understand; except at that rate, many listeners couldn\u2019t keep up with rapid stream of words, likely because their short-term memories were overtaxed.Some, of course, fared better than others. Just as people naturally read at different rates, subjects varied in how well they could understand accelerated speech. Further studies found a connection to cognitive ability. Those with higher intelligence, as well as faster readers, were more adept at understanding sped-up recordings. (The NSA once considered using tests involving accelerated speech to screen for people who could become morse code operators.)The most startling discovery, though, was that people actually enjoy listening to accelerated audio. Foulke and his colleagues noticed that college students preferred recordings that had been sped up by 30 percent, from 175 wpm to 222 wpm. More recent studies find that, given the choice, people will increase playback rate by about 40 to 50 percent on average \u2014 a 1.4 to 1.5x speedup.This tendency extends to video as well, as experiments with video lectures and even Discovery Channel shows have shown. Increasing the tempo of a recording seems to stave off boredom and help people stay engaged. \"With the slower pace, my attention span actually wavered, and I focused on too much detail,\" one subject told researchers at Microsoft.Sometimes, people don't even notice that they are watching on fast-forward. Cable companies will slightly speed up shows to make room for more ads, but the difference can be hard to detect \u2014 in part because the brain adapts to the higher speeds.In the 1970s and 1980s, the Defense Department began investigating compressed speech as a way to boost learning. Military-funded experiments showed that people can be trained to better understand accelerated recordings. Just a few weeks of regular exposure seemed to alter how people perceived and processed language, causing them to prefer faster and faster listening rates.Some of those changes happen within minutes. An experiment in 1997 found that listening to just five sentences of accelerated speech boosted subsequent comprehension rates by 15 percent. This process may be related to how our brains adjust to unfamiliar accents. Have you ever noticed that it becomes easier and easier to talk to someone with a foreign accent? It\u2019s not them. It\u2019s your brain making short-term adaptations.Our brains also make long-term adaptations to accelerated speech. Continued training increases people\u2019s accuracy rates and their comfort with sped-up recordings. Functional MRI scans show changes in how their brains respond to speech. Anecdotally, many subjects found that repeated exposure to accelerated speech caused speech at regular speeds to sound strange.This seems to have happened to me as well. After watching accelerated video on my computer for a few months, live television began to seem excruciatingly slow. Ilya Grigorik, the Google engineer who invented the Chrome extension, had a similar experience. He regularly watches videos at double speed, adjusting the pace up or down depending on how complex the ideas are.\"Whenever I describe it to people, I get a very weird look,\" he said. \"Then I actually convince them to try it. It\u2019s uncomfortable for them at first, but once they get into it, they really get into it.\"WE all chart our own paths through a text. I rarely read a book straight through from start to finish. I take detours, I backtrack, and I always scan the plot summary on Wikipedia to learn what's coming next. Psychologists at the University of California, San Diego have found that people enjoy a story more if the ending has already been spoiled. Suspense, it seems, is overrated.The Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nabokov believed that re-reading was the only way to truly enjoy a novel. Not until the second or third go-around can we perceive a novel\u2019s grand schemes and secrets. Of the initial encounter, he once said: \"When we read a book for the first time, the very process of laboriously moving our eyes from left to right, line after line, page after page, this complicated physical work upon the book, the very process of learning in terms of space and time what the book is about, this stands between us and artistic appreciation.\"There's no one right way to enjoy a book. Literary theorist Roland Barthes encouraged us not to treat novels so literally or linearly, but to traipse around in search of our own meanings. Why, then, do we still watch television straightforwardly? Why do we relinquish ourselves to the pace set by a film\u2019s director? Can't we find more interesting ways to be a couch potato?For a long time, the answer was that the technology did not allow it. But with the rise of computer viewing, everyone can take charge of how they travel through a video. I often consume reality programs at double speed or faster because the idioms of these shows are so familiar. For me, watching \"The Bachelorette\" is like shucking a crab. I know where the juicy bits are, and I know which parts are inedible.Accelerated speeds make it easier to perceive the structure of a story; slower speeds allow me to savor the details of the filmmaking. These alternative styles of viewing are no less illuminating. At double speed, the Red Wedding scene from \"Game of Thrones\" crosses the threshold from high drama to high farce. You start to see how the directors strained to create a moment of maximum trauma, how the death scenes are overacted, how the massacre operates like the mechanical gnashings of a meat-processing plant.Wonkblog writer Jeff Guo watches all his television shows at 160% speed. This clip from HBO's Game of Thrones will give you an idea of what that looks like. (HBO)I recently described my viewing habits to Mary Sweeney, the editor on the cerebral cult classic \"Mulholland Drive.\" She laughed in horror. \"Everything you just said is just anathema to a film editor,\" she said. \"If you don't have respect for how something was edited, then try editing some time! It's very hard.\"Sweeney, who is also a professor at the University of Southern California, believes in the privilege of the auteur. She told me a story about how they removed all the chapter breaks from the DVD version of Mulholland Drive to preserve the director\u2019s vision. \"The film, which took two years to make, was meant to be experienced from beginning to end as one piece,\" she said.I disagree. Mulholland Drive is one of my favorite films, but it's intentionally dreamlike and incomprehensible at times. The DVD version even included clues from director David Lynch to help people baffled by the plot. I advise first-time viewers to watch with a remote in hand to ward off disorientation. Liberal use of the fast-forward and rewind buttons allows people to draw connections between different sections of the film.I found something of a sympathetic ear in Peter Markham, who teaches directing at the American Film Institute Conservatory. \"This notion of privacy, of watching privately and forming your own cathedral of narrative \u2014 that\u2019s interesting,\" he said. \"But that, I think, is mostly an intellectual or cerebral experience. The thing about dramatic narrative is that it creates an emotional, visceral, subconscious experience. That stuff has its own rhythm, its own insistence.\"Markham argued that film is more than a stream of dialogue or a sequence of events. The timing of the images imprints on our brains in a special way. \"If you speed up Hitchcock, if you speed up \"Rear Window,\" you won\u2019t get the same experience,\" he said. \"It\u2019s like trying to speed up a Beyonce\u0301 track. It\u2019s already at the perfect speed.\"IT didn\u2019t occur to me until later, of course, that people do mess with Beyonce\u0301 all the time. DJs chop her up, stretch her over new beats, snatch bits of her vocals to craft new songs. Today\u2019s cinema fans also engage in forms of creative remixing. They assemble montages of their favorite characters. They create entirely original shows by re-editing scenes from ones. The actor Topher Grace, for instance, famously made his own unauthorized version of the \"Star Wars\" prequel movies called \"Episode III.5: The Editor Strikes Back.\" Those who have seen it say it's a masterful recombobulation of those three flawed films.Henry Jenkins, a media theorist at the University of Southern California, reminded me that creative repurposing has been happening in fan communities for decades. Throughout his career, Jenkins has studied the rise of \"participatory culture\" \u2014 ways in which fans take control of favorite stories through fanzines, fan art, fan fiction, and more recently, fan videos. \"Fans reject the idea of a definitive version produced, authorized, and regulated by some media conglomerate,\" Jenkins wrote over a decade ago. \"Instead, fans envision a world where all of us can participate in the creation and circulation of central cultural myths.\"Perhaps fan culture offers the most optimistic vision for the future of media consumption. The power of the auteur is diminishing, but our appreciation for the art form is increasing. More and more, we will watch TV on our computers, on own terms, creating our own meanings and deriving our own, private pleasures.\"I think your experience is very similar to my own,\" Jenkins said. \"I do treat television more and more like a book. I totally get that analogy, and it's a good way to think about the degree of control we now have over what we watch \u2014 which has been building up over time, with VCRs, then DVRs, and now streaming and digital distribution. We're learning to think about television in a different way.\"\"I'm fully convinced that everything is better in a box set,\" he added.Netflix, which is essentially the motherlode of box sets, has made this kind of careful viewing much easier. That's one reason that serialized shows have become so popular in recent years. Since audiences can easily catch up on missed episodes \u2014 many of them are bingewatching anyway \u2014 show-runners can tell longer, more complicated stories with less repetition. The rewind button allows television to be a little more sophisticated. If you didn't understand the first time, just watch again.But the spread of solitary, customized viewing will not mean the demise of television culture \u2014 quite the opposite. People will watch an episode and dissect it on Twitter; they will share their favorite scenes and watch them on repeat. \"While viewing is becoming a more solitary, personal activity, the flip side is that fan communities have grown stronger,\" Jennifer Holt, a media scholar at the University of California at Santa Barbara, told me. \"People still want to connect. They still want that social experience, only now it's all happening online.\"This practice has expanded the dialogue between the makers and the consumers of television. \"Show creators, writers and directors are now extremely sensitive to what the blogosphere is saying about their shows,\" Paris Barclay, the president of the Directors Guild of America, said a few years ago. Barclay, who has worked on shows such as \"Glee,\" \"Empire\" and \"Scandal,\" was wary of this development. \"Some shows have become increasingly dull because taking risks with the show is discouraged,\" he said. \"Audiences generally want to see a different version of the show that they love. They don\u2019t really want to see it become something else.\"But as Jenkins, the media theorist, points out, creators have always adapted their work to suit who was listening. \"Storytelling is a bardic medium,\" he said. \"Bards like Homer would tell a story to a roomful of people and he would be attentive to what they liked and what they didn't like. The same was true of Dickens, whose novels were published serially. He changed plot points and characters on the fly.\"Now that tools are making it increasingly easy to alter the flow of how we watch films and television, viewers will also have power to change the plot and the characters of a show to suit their own tastes. We should look forward to a future that involves more cross-pollination, more crazy fan-theories, more creative misunderstandings, all of it enabled by new ways of consuming television, whether that means binge-watching, surfing clips on social media or even watching on fast-forward. We risk transforming, perhaps permanently, the ways in which our brains perceive people, time, space, emotion.

Start by using packaging tape to cover your cutting board so that you have a clean, smooth surface (that will also make for easy cleanup). You could also use clingwrap to cover your surface, but you would need to make sure that it is secured and smooth with no wrinkles or pockets for air.2. Now, grab your springform pan and set aside the bottom piece, you\u2019ll only need to outer ring for this project. Cover the inside surface of the ring with the same tape you used for the cutting board, trying to make it as smooth as possible.3. Place the springform ring on top of the cutting board and secure it to the taped surface by using super glue on the inside edge where the pan meets the board.4. While the super glue is setting, mix the cast resin, following the instructions very carefully. This is the most important step of the project. When you\u2019re ready, pour the mixture into the pan.5. Now it\u2019s time to make it colorful! Grab whatever color sprinkles you want and add them to the epoxy mixture. Just a heads up, you\u2019re probably not going to have any sprinkles left over from this project for your cake, so make sure to plan accordingly! The sprinkles will settle to the bottom of the glue mixture, so try to spread them out as evenly as possible. Don\u2019t be afraid to get creative!6. This steps pretty simple. All you have to do is take a hair dryer to the mixture. This will get rid of any air bubbles.7. Wait 24 hours for the mixture to completely set and dry. Then, simply pull the springform ring from the cutting board, and then pop out the mold.8. Smooth the uneven edges of the colorful creation with sandpaper. The YouTuber doing the tutorial uses a lathe, if you happen to have one.9. The last step is to choose a base for the stand. Choose a round block of wood with a wide diameter and secure it to the back of the mold with super glue.10. Once you have the base secured, flip over the stand and place something heavy on top of it so that the glue really adheres to the mold.11.

Is Disney really greasing the palms of movie critics to make sure the House Of Mouse reigns supreme at the box office? Like the word \"supercalafragalisticexpialadoshus\", this is all nonsense.I\u2019m not saying this because I write for a primarily Disney-themed blog. For the record, I LOVED BVS.

No matter how many times Randolph retweeted a critic comparing BVS and Civil War or how sophisticated the petition tried to sound, there was absolutely no proof at all. You can\u2019t make strong accusations like that and then bring nothing to the table. Why would respected movie critics like Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune or Ty Burr of the Boston Globe compromise their integrity and bring their character into question by accepting bribes from Disney just to give a movie a bad review? Honestly think about that.As much as I loved Batman v Superman, I can see why people didn\u2019t like it at all. The movie seemed to be missing some key plot points (How did Superman know Bruce Wayne was Batman? What exactly was Lex Luthor\u2019s reason for hating Superman? Why was Diana Prince looking at that sword in the museum with Bruce?), the tone was too dark at times and Jesse Eisenberg seemed to be channeling Daffy Duck for his version of Lex.What would Walt Disney Studios have to gain by paying off critics to give their competition bad reviews? They currently have five of the top ten highest grossing films of all time (Star Wars: the Force Awakens, The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Frozen and Iron Man 3) and three of the top five highest grossing films of 2016 so far (Zootopia, Civil War and the Jungle Book).

The rule can prove more challenging to abide by than you might suspect at first. But both of us feel it's well worth the occasional angst we experience in order to enjoy a romance that lets us feel totally connected and utterly trusting of each other.What does Radical Honesty mean? It means, quite simply, that you tell the your partner everything that's going on in your life. Everything. Not just where you're going that evening and what you'll be doing at work that day and with whom, but also mentioning when someone you meet gives you butterflies. When you feel an urge to reach out to an ex. When you get overwhelmed with guilt about someone you hurt years ago.It means sharing when someone at the office gets flirtatious with you\u2014even if you don't reciprocate his or her advances. Or telling your partner you find someone\u2014even a movie star\u2014sexy. In sum, it boils down to full disclosure and keeping zero secrets in an attempt to ward off any potential trouble further down the road.My desire for Radical Honesty runs deep. I was married for six years and in a nine-year relationship prior to meeting and marrying my current husband, Kiran.Back then I was married to Sid, who was not the love of my life by any means, but we did have a caring, fun relationship\u2014until it all fell apart. I gradually discovered that Sid had been lying to me. First about small things, like running into an ex at an event and grabbing a quick drink with her. Then about big things, like hitting on a mutual friend of ours, telling her how much he wanted to sleep with her. After we divorced, the walls came tumbling down. Other people shared their stories about Sid. Turns out my ex had been dishonest about who he was at his very core. It took me a long time to forgive him\u2014and myself.What I learned beyond a shadow of a doubt from my first marriage was a gift. I came to see how lies, no matter how tiny, can snowball into grander and far more humiliating deceptions. Lies completely undermined my relationship with Sid; I was not about to allow the same thing to happen with Kiran.Of course, practicing Radical Honesty can be tough. It forces you to confront tough emotions head on. In a society that teaches us to avoid conflict as much as humanly possible, to make amends, smooth things over, and tell white lies, Radical Honesty is the opposite policy. It's all about diving headfirst into sticky situations in the name of love.I'll give you an example. I have promised to tell Kiran whenever I hear from an ex-boyfriend, just as he will tell me whenever an ex-girlfriend contacts him. I personally don't think there's anything worse than glancing at your partner's cellphone when it rings or buzzes and seeing that heart-pounding, knee-shaking, jealousy-inspiring ex's name on the screen. What could more instantly and assuredly inspire a total mental breakdown? At least this way, I know that if Angela or Katy (not their real names) reaches out, Kiran will tell me about it\u2014pronto.And yet in spite of our Radical Honesty commitment, I had trouble practicing it in the early days of our relationship. One day, I got an email from an ex (let's call him Robert) saying that he'd be in town, and asking whether I'd like to get together for coffee. It was a totally innocent request. Robert knew that I was blissfully married to the love of my life, and he himself was in a new, seemingly happy relationship. Furthermore, we had only spent six months dating, and things had ended amicably when we decided to go our separate ways.But for some reason, I didn't tell Kiran right away. I wrote back to Robert, saying sure, I'd be happy to meet up for coffee that weekend. Then I waited. And waited. Again, to be clear, I didn't have any intentions of infidelity or any lingering feelings for Robert. I always was going to tell Kiran about my plans to meet up with my ex. But I didn't act immediately to share the news. I was hiding Robert's request for a meeting from Kiran because the prospect of discussing my ex with my current love made me uncomfortable. I worried that Kiran would get jealous. That it would just upset him. I didn't want to hurt his feelings. I wanted to protect him.Well, keeping Robert's email a secret couldn't possibly have been a worse decision. I should have said something to Kiran right away and asked him if he was okay with the platonic rendezvous. If he had been hurt, if he had gotten jealous, I could've handled it. If he had said \"No, don't meet Robert for coffee,\" I absolutely would have respected his wishes.But I waited until the day before Robert was coming to town before I said something. When I did, Kiran was upset, wanting to know when I had made these plans. I was honest and admitted it had been several days ago. We got into an argument. In the end, Kiran was far more upset that I had explicitly violated our Radical Honesty rule than he was about Robert contacting me or my agreeing to see Robert for coffee. Kiran felt betrayed that I had kept a secret from him for days.I felt horrible, apologetic, and dishonest. And I ended up canceling on Robert, because repairing my relationship with my one true love was more important to me than making a social visit with an ex. Everyone lost out due to my own reluctance to confront the situation fearlessly and with integrity.On the contrary, every time I have shared my vulnerabilities with Kiran, he has responded with such tenderness and compassion that I am blown away. He meets every embarrassing memory or urge with love, respect and understanding\u2014and I do the same for him.Because of this\u2014our ongoing policy of Radical Honesty\u2014I know beyond a doubt that our marriage will endure.

Lee Terry (R-Neb.) said on Thursday that he is against military intervention in Syria, even though his \"gut feeling\" is that the Syrian government now possesses chemical weapons that came from fallen Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussain.Terry, who has served in the House since 1999, supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. In an interview on Thursday with Omaha radio host Tom Becka, Terry said Syria was a completely different situation.\"The theory then and the evidence was that Iraq was an enemy of the United States and had direct plans in either support of al Qaeda and/or with other weapons that we found out weren\u2019t there -- which I still think they were moved to Syria,\" said Terry. \"And it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if some of the chemical weapons that have been used by Syria actually came from Iraq.\"There is no evidence that Hussein sent weapons of mass destruction to Syria. When Becka asked whether Terry's claim about the transfer of weapons was based on information he had received as a member of Congress, Terry replied, \"Gut feeling. Yeah, I have not had any classified briefing, but all we know that Iraq had ... chemical and biological weapons and then they weren\u2019t there. ... It wasn\u2019t that the U.S. was guessing; that was something that they had actually declared. But they went someplace.\"Terry, however, is not the first to make this claim; it's been circulating for years among supporters of an invasion. Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney said he believed the transfer was \"entirely possible\" in a 2007 interview. Many proponents of this theory cite an October 2003 statement by James Clapper, Jr., who was leading the National Imagery and Mapping Agency at the time and later became the Director of National Intelligence.''I think people below the Saddam Hussein-and-his-sons level saw what was coming and decided the best thing to do was to destroy and disperse,'' said Clapper, adding that \"the obvious conclusion one draws\" is that there ''may have been people leaving the scene, fleeing Iraq, and unquestionably, I am sure, material.\"The New York Times noted in 2003 that Clapper had been providing a \"personal assessment,\" and a spokesman for his agency \"could not provide further evidence to support the general's statement.\"In 2005, the CIA\u2019s top weapons inspector in Iraq and head of the Iraq Study Group, Charles Duelfer, said while it was possible there had been such a transfer, they had failed to find any proof of this theory. From the ISG report:The investigation centered on the possibility that WMD materials were moved to Syria. ... ISG found no senior policy, program, or intelligence officials who admitted any direct knowledge of such movement of WMD. Indeed, they uniformly denied any knowledge of residual WMD that could have been secreted to Syria. [...] Based on the evidence available at present, ISG judged that it was unlikely that an official transfer of WMD material from Iraq to Syria took place. However, ISG was unable to rule out unofficial movement of limited WMD-related materials.The ISG also concluded, \"While a small number of old, abandoned chemical munitions have been discovered, ISG judges that Iraq unilaterally destroyed its undeclared chemical weapons stockpile in 1991.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [19], "text": ["Lee Terry"]}, "id": "373504275642462209"}, {"question": "The Surprising Reason Why More Americans Aren\u2019t Going To Church", "context": "\u00a9 Thomas Peter/Reuters A man dives in icy water during Epiphany celebrations near a monastery in the historic town of Rostov Veliky, some 200 km (124 miles) from Moscow January 19, 2009. Orthodox...The standard narrative of American religious decline goes something like this: A few hundred years ago, European and American intellectuals began doubting the validity of God as an explanatory mechanism for natural life. As science became a more widely accepted method for investigating and understanding the physical world, religion became a less viable way of thinking\u2014not just about medicine and mechanics, but also culture and politics and economics and every other sphere of public life. As the United States became more secular, people slowly began drifting away from faith.Of course, this tale is not just reductive\u2014it\u2019s arguably inaccurate, in that it seems to Of course, this tale is not just reductive\u2014it\u2019s arguably inaccurate, in that it seems to capture neither the reasons nor the reality behind contemporary American belief. For one thing, the U.S. is still overwhelmingly religious, despite years of predictions about religion\u2019s demise. A significant number of people who don\u2019t identify with any particular faith group still say they believe in God , and roughly 40 percent pray daily or weekly. While there have been changes in this kind of private belief and practice, the most significant shift has been in the way people publicly practice their faith: Americans, and particularly young Americans, are less likely to attend services or identify with a religious group than they have at any time in recent memory.If most people haven\u2019t just logicked their way out of believing in God, what\u2019s behind this shift in public religious practice, and what does the shift look like in detail? That\u2019s a big question, one less in search of a straightforward answer than a series of data points and arguments constellated over time. Here\u2019s one: Pew has a If most people haven\u2019t just logicked their way out of believing in God, what\u2019s behind this shift in public religious practice, and what does the shift look like in detail? That\u2019s a big question, one less in search of a straightforward answer than a series of data points and arguments constellated over time. Here\u2019s one: Pew has a new survey out about the way people choose their congregations and attend services. While Americans on the whole are still going to church and other worship services less than they used to, many people are actually going more\u2014and those who are skipping out aren\u2019t necessarily doing it for reasons of belief.There were at least three fascinating tidbits tucked into the results of the survey. First, people who report going to worship services less frequently now than they used to overwhelmingly say the logistics of getting there are the biggest obstacle.Second, a significant number of people who said they\u2019re not part of any particular religion expressed mistrust of religious institutions, suggesting these organizations\u2019 reputations have something to do with why people are dropping out of public religious participation.Finally, and perhaps most interestingly, the country seems to be split in half in terms of how often people get to services. Roughly 51 percent of Americans say they go to church or another worship service somewhere between once a month and multiple times per week, while 49 percent said they go rarely or never. But within that 51 percent, more than half of people said they go more often than they used to\u2014in other words, about quarter of Americans have gotten more active in their religious communities in recent years, not less.On the other hand, fewer than half of the people who rarely or never go to church said this has been a new decline in the last few years; a greater portion of that group said they\u2019ve always stayed home on Sundays. All of this is a way of saying that, comparatively speaking, there\u2019s more activity happening on the devout side of the spectrum than the drop-out side; this study suggests that even in a time of religion\u2019s public decline, some people are experiencing religious revival.According to the survey, about one-fifth of Americans now go to religious services a few times a year, but say they used to go a lot more. Roughly half of this group stopped going as often because of what the researchers called \"practical issues\": They are too busy, have a crazy work schedule, or describe themselves as \"too lazy\" to go. Others said they just don\u2019t care about attending services as much as doing other things.While it\u2019s easy to empathize with the hassle of trying to wake up and rally kids to go sit still for several hours every Sunday morning, this explanation is interesting for a slightly different reason: It suggests that many people view religious services as optional in a way they might not have in the past. Fifty or 60 years ago, churches, in particular, were a While it\u2019s easy to empathize with the hassle of trying to wake up and rally kids to go sit still for several hours every Sunday morning, this explanation is interesting for a slightly different reason: It suggests that many people view religious services as optional in a way they might not have in the past. Fifty or 60 years ago, churches, in particular, were a center of social and cultural life in America. For many people, that\u2019s still the case, but the survey suggests that many people may be creating their social lives outside of a religious context\u2014or perhaps forgoing that kind of social connection altogether.The experience of those who are losing their religion shouldn\u2019t obscure those who are finding it.The sidelining of services may connect to another factor indicated in the survey: Among people who were raised religiously and who fell away from religion in adult life, roughly one-fifth said their dislike of organized religion was the reason. Another 50 percent said they stopped believing in the particular tenets of the faith they were raised in. Insofar as the decline in U.S. religious affiliation is an intellectual or philosophical story, it seems to be this: Fewer people are willing to sign on with the rules and reputations of institutions that promote faith. That doesn\u2019t mean people don\u2019t care about religious ideas or questions\u2014many of those who are unaffiliated with a particular group still consider themselves \"religious\" or \"seeking\"\u2014but they might not be as sold on the religious institutions themselves.The experience of those who are losing their religion shouldn\u2019t obscure the experience of those who are finding it, though. Twenty-seven percent of people in the survey say they\u2019re attending services more often than they did in the past, cutting against the country\u2019s overall decline in religious practice. This was most common among evangelical Protestants, three-quarters of whom say they go to church at least once or twice a month. Half of the people who said they\u2019re going to services more often explained the change in terms of their beliefs: They\u2019ve become more religious; they found that they need God in their life; they\u2019ve gotten more mature as they\u2019ve aged. By contrast, relatively few said they started going to church more often for practical reasons. Belief brings people to worship, it seems, while logistics keep people way.The survey offers evidence that at least some Americans find worship services less relevant than other things they could be doing with their time, or perhaps they\u2019re too hard to make time for. But the biggest takeaway is the variety of religious experience in America. Just as some people are drifting away from religion, others are moving toward it\u2014and no matter what they might do on Sunday mornings, many people seem to find religious thinking still relevant to their lives.", "answers": {"answer_start": [2794], "text": ["logistics of getting there"]}, "id": "5038eg"}, {"question": "The food that makes you gain the worst kind of fat", "context": "By Corrie PikulFor every person recommending some new health fix, there's another person telling you to try the opposite. Here's one area where everyone who knows the score is on the same page.It's been called a poison, a drug and a toxin, and scientists have started blaming it for everything from obesity to heart disease to diabetes. It's sugar\u2014specifically, added sugar, not the kind in fruit\u2014and while we all know we should eat it \"in moderation,\" that can be almost impossible (we'll explain why in a minute). While there are a million ways to lose weight, feel better and improve your health, giving up added sugar\u2014as unfathomable as that might seem to those of us who live for sweet rewards, motivators and indulgences\u2014is the only strategy that health care providers everywhere would support. Here's why:1. Sugar is harder to resist than any other food.We need sugar to function\u2014without it, we'd quickly power down. It's so important, in fact, that our bodies have the ability to synthesize it from fat, complex carbs and protein through processes that take place in the liver. But when presented with effort-free sugar on a platter (or in a drinking glass or a candy box), our bodies go wild. Sugar is even more compelling than fat, found a recent study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Researchers tracked brain activity in more than 100 high school students while they drank chocolate-flavored milkshakes and found that shakes that were high in sugar but low in fat fired up the brain's reward circuitry just as strongly as super-decadent shakes that paired sugar and fat in large quantities. Increasing the fat content of the shakes didn't have the same effect, affirming that sugar was what the students' brains really wanted.2. ...In fact, sugar can be as hard to resist as drugs.The idea of a \"sugar addiction\" isn't just a concept broadcast far and wide by your green-juice-obsessed neighbor. Experiments with both people and animals have shown that sugar affects the brain in the same way that morphine and other opioids do, and when sugar-addicted rodents were suddenly taken off the stuff, they went through withdrawal\u2014complete with the shakes and anxiety. They had become chemically dependent, explains Nicole Avena, PhD, a neuroscientist with the New York Obesity Research Center at Columbia University who was involved in these studies and is the author of Why Diets Fail (Because You're Addicted to Sugar). Humans get hooked, too. The more sugar we eat, the more we want, Avena says, and we need increasing amounts of it to keep producing the same euphoric effects. That's one of the main reasons people who say they're just going to have a tiny scoop of ice cream (and really mean it) end up eating four scoops.3. It makes you gain the worst kind of fat.Consuming refined sugar won't only lead to a gain in body fat, but it can also cause you to develop fat inside your liver, and that's a major health risk, explains Robert H. Lustig, MD, MSL, an obesity expert and the author of Fat Chance: Beating the Odds Against Sugar, Processed Food, Obesity and Disease and The Fat Chance Cookbook. When you eat more fructose (the sweet molecule in sugar) than your liver can handle, the liver turns the excess into fat. Some of it gets transported out and lodges in the arterial walls, increasing your risk of heart disease, while the rest accumulates inside liver cells, leading to non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease, making your liver sick. Lustig says this causes insulin levels to rise, which drives up blood pressure and increases your risk for pancreatic burnout and diabetes, lipid problems and cancer.4. It makes you old beyond your years.Consuming a lot of fructose, such as in the much-maligned (but still much-consumed) high-fructose corn syrup, accelerates cellular damage and aging, Lustig says, and causes cells all over the body to die off faster than normal. A fatty liver plus a high percentage of these rapidly decaying cells puts you at a higher risk for cancer, cognitive decline and other degenerative diseases, he says.5. It's everywhere.Eighty percent of all packaged foods contain sugar, Avena says, even many items that don't seem particularly sweet. Bread, pepperoni and other cured meats, ketchup, tomato sauce in jars, peanut butter (even many \"all-natural\" brands), savory crackers\u2014these are just a few of the unexpected foods that Avena says contain surprise amounts of non-naturally-occurring sugar, making it hard for us to stay below the American Heart Association's recommendation of six teaspoons per day.6. ...And it's often hiding out under an alias.If you're sold on the idea of avoiding sugar, then you know you'll have to watch out for high-fructose corn syrup, too. And cane syrup. And molasses. Agave. Caramel. Dextrose, glucose solids, d-mannose...Avena says there are more than 50 names for sugar, and many of them are cryptic and easy to overlook. Scour labels to make sure that you recognize all the ingredients (for example, a bag of potato chips should contain potatoes, oil, salt, and that's it).As a reminder, always consult your doctor for medical advice and treatment before starting any program.", "answers": {"answer_start": [815], "text": ["Sugar"]}, "id": "429738128518438912"}, {"question": "Find Out What Prince George Is Called at Preschool", "context": "He's heir to the throne of the United Kingdom, but at school he's just one of the kids.Prince George, who is kicking off his sixth week of preschool at Westacre Montessori in Norfolk, near his family's country home, leaves his title at the classroom door when he hangs up his coat each day.The 2-year-old royal is known simply as \"George\" among his classmates and teachers, a royal source confirms.

This cloud is in the process of collapsing down under its own gravity to give birth to a star \u2014 but it's a race against time, because the established bright stars in its vicinity are fighting this process.There are 65 extremely hot, bright stars lurking nearby the cloud, visible on the right side of the image. A powerful stellar wind is blowing out from these stars, as well as 500 less bright companions nearby, gradually eroding the caterpillar cloud.The cloud is fighting back, too, though, bulking up over time by collecting material surrounding its outer envelope. Whether the caterpillar will gather enough mass to counteract the erosion is unclear. \"Only time will tell if the formed star will be a 'heavy-weight' or a 'light-weight' with respect to its mass,\" NASA scientists wrote in a statement.The caterpillar cloud is called IRAS 20324+4057, and the cluster of bright stars on the right is known as the Cygnus OB2 association. The area lies 4,500 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus, the Swan. The bright stars are 15 light-years away from the cloud.The new image is a composite of two photographs. One was captured in green and infrared light by the Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys in 2006.

The previous low was a 6.7, which happened on two separate occasions, once in 2007.The reason behind the low viewership isn\u2019t that Drew Brees and Matt Ryan are boring, or that fans didn\u2019t feel like watching the Saints\u2019 secondary get ripped to shreds yet again. It has to do with the other battle going on at the same time between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.Monday night\u2019s presidential debate, the first of three, drew a whopping 80.9 million viewers in America across the 12 networks that carried it, according to CNN. That doesn\u2019t include those who watched at restaurants or bars, or the people who streamed it live online.The debate earned a 46.2 overnight rating, which is unprecedented for a broadcast outside of the Super Bowl.

Because how well do you know someone until they've shared their guiltiest pleasures?Bill Engvall is one of the best damn 'blue collar' comedians you'll find in these parts. The \"Dancing With the Stars\" alum was on his way to becoming a household name soon after teaming up with Blue Collar Comedy pals Larry the Cable Guy, Ron White and Jeff Foxworthy -- circa 2000 -- where they took their act on the road, quickly becoming the hippest rednecks in North America.Engvall's album \"Here's Your Sign\" is certified platinum and his second album \"Dorkfish,\" landed at the No. 1 position on the Billboard Comedy Chart. The 56-year-old comedian even got his own TV show \"The Bill Engvall Show\" (2007--2009) on TBS where he hired a then unknown, future Academy Award-winning actress, Jennifer Lawrence, who played his teenage daughter, Lauren Pearson.Engvall braved the balmy warm weather out west while agreeing to sit down and take HuffPost's #nofilter challenge. While we had his attention (prior to the quiz), we asked about his courageous stint on Season 17 of \"Dancing With The Stars\" -- with dancing pro Emma Slater (he finished fourth) -- and his time on set with that little superstar, JLaw.I loved you on \"Dancing with the Stars.\" How much fun was that for you?It was a blast. As I told Emma, my little dance partner, \"I didn't want to like it as much as I did.\" It was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, but I will tell you that it's the most addictive thing and I actually miss it believe it or not -- even through all the aches and pains and pulled groins. It was something that was so far out of my comfort zone. It taught me that when life puts a challenge in front of you, don't necessarily back away from it because it may be something that you didn't see.How much pressure did you feel each week on the results show? I noticed each week when you were saved, there was this shocked look on your face.I would say that after about week five every time Emma and I got pushed forward my reaction was, \"Hey. Oh God. Really? Can we not recount?\" (Laughs) Honestly, after week two I didn't feel any pressure at all because I had already achieved what I thought I could do.Did you ever hold out hope that you could win that Mirror Ball Trophy?I honestly think I had a shot to win it. I'm glad Amber Riley won. It actually played out the way it should have because getting knocked out the first night of the finals was perfect because I was actually done. Literally my body was saying there's just no more in the tank. Because it was 13 weeks of six hours-a-day without a day off.In one of the taped packages, I laughed out loud when they ran the piece where Emma had her legs wrapped around your neck. The look on your face was priceless.The thing was she kept wanting to do all these tricks and I was like, \"I don't know if I can do them.\" So we did this one and when they showed the footage, my friend's like \"Dude, what's your wife think?\" I go \"Please! Emma is younger than my daughter.\" (Laughs) It was like she had a lot more energy and flexibility than I did. My only thought was just don't drop her. Don't do anything to hurt her. So that's why the look on my face was like, \"Oh, let's just get through this.\"The last time I interviewed you, you were in the middle of \"The Bill Engvall Show.\" You told me at the time: \"If it gets canceled, I will be devastated.\" Shows get canceled every day so when your show was axed, how did you take it?It hurt because I felt like if this show had been on five years earlier, I'd be in syndication. The week that it got canceled I had talked to TBS and they had said we're going to announce that we're going to shoot 75 more and be in syndication. Literally the next day, the market went crazy and the bottom dropped out. In syndication, the biggest buyers are car dealerships. When they got hit, there was nobody buying syndication, so I literally was one day from being in syndication.Jennifer Lawrence played your teenage daughter.Yeah, bless her little heart. All the interviews she did, she always gave me credit. In fact, when she was on the Barbara Walters special just recently somebody called me and said, \"Hey, Jennifer Lawrence said you gave her her first job.\" And I said, \"Well we did.\" She was one of those I knew we weren't going to be able to hold her very long. We were going to have to write the episode where she went off to college because you just knew she was going to move on to bigger things.Did you teach her everything she needed to know about acting?(Laughs) No. That girl had it. And I hate that word, she had \"it,\" but she really did.When she won the Academy Award last year, how proud were you for her?I couldn't have been more proud if she had been my own daughter. The thing I loved about Jenny and I still love is that she's just down to earth. I hope the business doesn't jade her because she's so genuine and I think that's what people love about her.What's your guiltiest pleasure?Getting massages.If you had only one choice, would you rather be the sexiest man in the world or the smartest?I think I'd rather be the sexiest.

The team cut a total of 20 players so that they could get down to the NFL mandated 53-man limit by 4 p.m. ET.The 49ers had four quarterbacks on their roster going into Saturday, and it was pretty clear that at least one of them was going to cut. In the end, coach Chip Kelly decided to dump rookie Jeff Driskel and keep Kaepernick.The move by Kelly wasn't a complete surprise. The 49ers coach has said all along that if he kept Kaepernick, it would be a football decision that would be unrelated to his protest of the national anthem. In the week leading up to cut day, Kelly made it clear that he thought Kaepernick was one of the two best quarterbacks on his roster.The decision to keep Kaepernick raises some interesting questions going forward.For one, Kaepernick's contract now becomes an issue. If the quarterback plays at all in 2016 and gets injured, then his 2017 base salary of $14.5 million would automatically become guaranteed.Kaepernick also receives a $125,000 bonus for every game that he's on the team's active roster, so if the 49ers decide to deactivate him on game day -- and go with Christian Ponder as their No. 2 QB -- then the team could save $2 million in bonus money ($125,000 x 16 games).Of course, Kelly doesn't think like a front office guy when it comes to contracts, so don't expect him to deactivate Kaepernick just to keep him from earning a game day bonus.#49ers Chip Kelly: Right now Blaine is No. 1 and will start vs. the Rams.

All the information required by a viewer of Times Now can be had from the channel itself.

That is why his army of reporters were out in full force on social media defending their one true god against any and all criticism. Remember, the chosen one can never do anything wrong. The only reason he is being mocked is because the others are jealous of him. They will never have his voice or his brains or his success. The only reason they go after him is to bring him down.Arnab and other members of his cult tried to dismiss the backlash as pushback from Lutyens\u2019 loyalists but even they know that is not the truth. People did not criticise him because they wanted him to be disrespectful to the prime minister. No sane person would want or expect him to yell at an elected representative of the public.

Sharks? Snakes? Humans?Of course the answer depends on how you define dangerous. Personally I\u2019ve had a thing about sharks since the first time I saw Jaws. But if you\u2019re judging by how many people are killed by an animal every year, then the answer isn\u2019t any of the above. It\u2019s mosquitoes.When it comes to killing humans, no other animal even comes close. Take a look:What makes mosquitoes so dangerous? Despite their innocuous-sounding name\u2014Spanish for \"little fly\"\u2014they carry devastating diseases. The worst is malaria, which kills more than 600,000 people every year; another 200 million cases incapacitate people for days at a time. It threatens half of the world\u2019s population and causes billions of dollars in lost productivity annually. Other mosquito-borne diseases include dengue fever, yellow fever, and encephalitis.There are more than 2,500 species of mosquito, and mosquitoes are found in every region of the world except Antarctica. During the peak breeding seasons, they outnumber every other animal on Earth, except termites and ants. They were responsible for tens of thousands of deaths during the construction of the Panama Canal. And they affect population patterns on a grand scale: In many malarial zones, the disease drives people inland and away from the coast, where the climate is more welcoming to mosquitoes.Considering their impact, you might expect mosquitoes to get more attention than they do. Sharks kill fewer than a dozen people every year and in the U.S. they get a week dedicated to them on TV every year. Mosquitoes kill 50,000 times as many people, but if there\u2019s a TV channel that features Mosquito Week, I haven\u2019t heard about it.That\u2019s why we\u2019re having Mosquito Week on the Gates Notes.Everything I\u2019m posting this week is dedicated to this deadly creature.

But state lawmakers have remained largely silent, even as three public institutions are under federal investigation.Four universities in Virginia are currently being investigated by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights for possible Title IX violations specifically related to sexual violence -- JMU, the University of Virginia, the College of William & Mary and the University of Richmond. Two other schools in the state, the Virginia Military Institute and Virginia Commonwealth University, faced Title IX reviews that concluded this spring.JMU's case is based on a complaint from a student who has since withdrawn from the university. The school found three men guilty of sexual assaulting her, and guilty of harassment for spreading video of the incident around campus. The school punished them with \"expulsion after graduation.\"\"A finding of responsible, but with expulsion after graduation, is not a just decision in this case,\" Tammy Castle, an associate professor of justice studies at JMU, told The Huffington Post.\"Students have been suspended for drinking offenses, and expelled for plagiarism, and this sends the message to the university community that sexual assault is not as serious as these other behaviors,\" Castle added. \"It also discourages victims from speaking out against sexual assault, and supports a rape culture.\"Students And Alumni Demand ChangeThe case, first publicized in June, has outraged students and alumni. An online petition demanding a change in JMU's sexual assault policies had reached 12,000 signatures as of Tuesday.JMU spokesman Bill Wyatt noted that prior to the petition, the university put in place \"a comprehensive, ongoing review of our policies, procedures, training, and support services relating to sexual harassment and assault.\" He declined to comment further to HuffPost except to refer back to a June 19 statement.However, alumni are noting in online discussions that this controversy is similar to issues some of them protested about 20 years ago.In 1993, students could only be charged with \"sexual misconduct,\" which covered everything from unwanted touching to rape. Students demanded a new policy that differentiated between more and less serious offenses, and at one point organized an overnight takeover of an administrative building on campus.\"We're talking right now about how we can respond to this latest situation,\" said Brian Kildee, one of the activists who pushed for reforms to the school's policy in the early '90s. \"We succeeded in changing some key policies in the 1990s. Twenty years later, it's clear that changing the underlying culture is much more difficult.\"Brad Perry, who about 14 years ago served two years as the Male Outreach Coordinator in the now-defunct JMU Office of Sexual Assault Education, said that during his tenure, officials were frequently unwilling to investigate cases.\"I remember a campus sexual assault colleague of mine said, 'Schools will never change the way they handle these cases until they are more scared of being sued by a victim's family than a perpetrator's family,'\" recalled Perry, who later spent a decade as a Statewide Violence Prevention Coordinator at a Virginia nonprofit. \"[Universities] don't really have a whole lot of incentive to do much about this and they haven't.\"Investigations On Multiple CampusesEach of the investigations at the Virginia schools, like that at JMU, was sparked by federal complaints.UVA's investigation is unusual in that it started in 2011, but remains open. The Education Department declined to say why the investigation was so long-running, and noted \"that some cases take longer than others due to the nature and complexity of the issues involved.\"Officials for the University of Richmond and the College of William & Mary confirmed their investigations were due to complaints. Richmond vowed to cooperate and noted it has in place a bystander-awareness training program to help students recognize and prevent sexual violence. William & Mary referred to a previous statement making similar points.VCU wrapped up a Title IX investigation in April with a signed agreement about a new policy it must put in place to deal with sexual violence and harassment. The April 29 letter closing the investigation -- which had been sparked by two complaints -- stated it did not determine whether VCU was compliant or not with Title IX, but the letter concluded OCR's review.OCR consolidated the two complaints about VCU into one investigation. One complaint was from a graduate student who alleged the university didn't properly handle discrimination she faced in a class, took nine months to resolve her case, and retaliated against her when she voiced her concerns. The other complaint alleged VCU botched a Title IX investigation and failed to coordinate with law enforcement to maintain victim confidentiality.There was no letter of findings issued to say what, if anything, VCU had done wrong in its handling of the cases.A recent OCR investigation found that the Virginia Military Institute, the oldest state-supported military college in the country, required female students who are pregnant or parenting to resign or face expulsion. One senior male cadet issued wire hangers to female student and told them they were their \"abortion tools,\" but VMI failed to involve a Title IX coordinator or take steps to discipline the male cadet. VMI agreed earlier this year to take a number of steps dictated by OCR to rectify its sex discrimination.No Legislative ActionDespite a flurry of activity by federal officials at Virginia's colleges, the state's lawmakers have remained on the sidelines.The Virginia governor's office, the leadership of the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates, and the chairs of the state education committees in the Virginia legislature all failed to respond to requests for comment from The Huffington Post about whether lawmakers had plans to address sexual assault on campus in the state.The Virginia legislature did consider one piece of legislation in 2011 that would have brought school and police investigations closer together by requiring local law enforcement to be notified of all campus rapes. The law was named \"Kathryn's Law\" after a UVA student, Kathryn Russell, who went public about how in 2004 the university tried to dissuade her from reporting her rape.UVA was also sued in 2003 by a rape victim who was told she'd face punishment if she spoke about her assailant, who the university had determined was responsible for sexual assault but had allowed to stay on campus. Following a 2004 story on the case in a local newspaper, more than 400 students gathered on campus wearing symbolic pink or red gags.The Education Department determined in 2008 that UVA violated the campus security law the Clery Act by requiring accusers to agree to a nondisclosure policy as a precondition to accessing outcomes and sanction information.Yet back in Virginia's state legislature, Kathryn's Law died in committee and never got a full vote.The bill did result in the Virginia Crime Commission conducting a statewide survey of college campuses. The review found that in 2010, there had been a total of 16 rape reports on Virginia campuses but zero arrests. Forcible fondling had led to three arrests.The commission found 10 percent of Virginia colleges did not have a written policy for rape investigations, as required by Va. Code \u00a7 9.1-1301, and 39 percent of universities were using a standard of proof in campus rape adjudications higher than what the federal government recommends. In addition, 76 percent allowed an accused rapist to cross-examine his reported victim.The ongoing federal investigations of JMU, UVA, William & Mary and Richmond could take six months to several years to complete. OCR typically concludes these investigations with resolution agreements stipulating changes that must be made by the schools. If the office is unable to reach a resolution agreement with the school, it can refer the case to the U.S. Department of Justice or move to cut off the university from federal funding.Need help?

However, the money was paid as part of Google\u2019s Vulnerability Reward Program, which offers cash to those spotting bugs lurking within its multitude of systems and tools. The company said in the post that last year it paid out more than $2 million to over 300 bug hunters around the world \u2013 equal to about $6,000 per payout, the same as Sanmay received (if you squint a little).Anyway, the MBA student said from the start that holding the Google domain \"was never about money,\" and was perfectly happy with Google\u2019s reward.

Over time, more companies began adopting Buckingham and Coffman\u2019s prescribed approach, and now companies like Facebook operate entirely on their philosophy. Facebook HR chief Lori Goler recommends their book to all new managers.In their book, Buckingham and Coffman define talent as \"a recurring pattern of thought, feeling, or behavior that can be productively applied.\"They say there are three types of talent to consider:Striving talents: \"They explain why he gets out of bed every day, why he is motivated to push and push just that little bit harder.\"\"They explain he gets out of bed every day, he is motivated to push and push just that little bit harder.\" Thinking talents: \"They explain how he thinks, how he weighs up alternatives, how he comes to his decisions.\"\"They explain he thinks, he weighs up alternatives, he comes to his decisions.\" Relating talents: \"They explain whom he trusts, whom he builds relationships with, whom he confronts, and whom he ignores.\"It is up to the manager to determine a talents profile for the position they are looking to fill.It\u2019s important, Buckingham told us, that this profile doesn\u2019t become a checklist that guides the job interview. The worst thing a manager can do in an interview, he said, is ask too many follow-up questions in an attempt to find the answer they\u2019re looking for.\"Every time you ask a question you give something away,\" he said. \"You don\u2019t want to give anything away.\"Buckingham explained that the interviewer should be looking for frequent behaviors, and if the candidate is a great fit, they will naturally reveal these behaviors without prodding.", "answers": {"answer_start": [532], "text": ["talent"]}, "id": "52eqjv"}, {"question": "Alicia Keys Changed \"The Voice\" With This One Move During Band Auditions", "context": "I was in high school when Alicia Keys' \"Fallin'\" came out.

Ryan (R-Wis.) of doing it himself.Hero @repjohnlewis is leading a sit-in on gun violence & @SpeakerRyan shut off the camera so you can\u2019t watch. Shameful. #NoBillNoBreak \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) June 22, 2016But that\u2019s actually not the whole story. In fact, the cameras are turned off as a matter of procedure when the House isn\u2019t in session \u2014 and the Democrats are essentially forcing the House out of session with their sit-in. It also seems worth noting that, when the tables were turned eight years ago and Republicans were doing a sit-in, both the cameras and the lights were also off.So let\u2019s put partisan politics aside and explain the real reason the C-SPAN cameras \u2014 the only cameras allowed in Congress \u2014 are off.When the new Congress got together in January of last year, like every new Congress before it, it voted on the rules that would govern it.One of those rules \u2014 ostensibly not that controversial at the time \u2014 was that when the House of Representatives wasn\u2019t in session, the C-SPAN cameras would be off. C-SPAN is useful for capturing a lot of moments the American public might not otherwise see, but no need to broadcast an empty room, right? (Side note: As even approving rules for C-SPAN\u2019s filming indicates, Congress controls what the cameras show and when.)Fast forward to Wednesday, when the House was just about to go out of session for the afternoon. House Democrats, led by civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), seized the floor and demanded a vote on gun-control measures. They literally sat down on the carpeted floor to demand a vote and said they\u2019d stay there as long as it took to negotiate one.D.C. perked up. We turned to C-SPAN. And C-SPAN had nothing to offer us.That\u2019s because House Republicans presiding over the floor at the time gaveled the Congress on a break as the sit-in started. There was clearly a disruption going on, and they weren\u2019t sure what to do. (The House isn\u2019t like the Senate, where one lawmaker can force it to stay in session for hours and hours.) So the House went on recess, and per the rules, the C-SPAN cameras shut off.Even congressional reporters, the people who cover the mundane ins and outs of House proceedings, were confused.Not to politicize C-SPAN, but this is one of those moments where they should maybe turn on the cameras. This is an unprecedented situation. \u2014 Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) June 22, 2016C-SPAN felt compelled to issue this statement via Twitter. It even pinned it to the top of its Twitter profile, meaning it's the first tweet people see when they visit its page. A yellow alert now runs on the bottom of the screen: \"CAMERAS IN CHAMBER CONTROLLED BY HOUSE.\"C-SPAN has no control over the U.S. House TV cameras. \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) June 22, 2016House Democrats began broadcasting their sit-in on Periscope, a feature most definitely not available the last time a sit-in occurred, back in 2008. (Also technically against House rules \u2014 no devices allowed on the floor.)Back then, House Republicans staged a sit-in as Congress was about to go on a month-long August break. They wanted Democrats, who were then in the majority, to allow a vote to expand oil and gas drilling to help alleviate $4-a-gallon prices.During that sit-in, as Politico reported \u2014 and Ryan\u2019s office felt compelled to point out \u2014 House Democrats actually turned off the lights in the chamber, too.\"Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the Democrats adjourned the House, turned off the lights and killed the microphones, but Republicans are still on the floor talking gas prices,\" wrote Politico\u2019s John Bresnahan.(The only other sit-in since the 1970s that political scientist and Catholic University professor Matthew Green could recall before that, in 1995, was over a budget dispute. Sit-ins are a pretty rare phenomenon.)Back to Wednesday\u2019s sit-in: Sure, Ryan technically could gavel back in session to get the cameras rolling again. But that\u2019s not really within the realm of political reality; House Democrats are actively working against his interests, both politically and policy-wise.A few hours after the sit-in began, the cameras did flash on when the GOP gaveled back in and made one futile attempt to restore order. They essentially asked the Democrats to stop their sit-in and go back to the day\u2019s business. Democrats refused, even yelling over the speaker. And the House gaveled back out.Per House rules, the C-SPAN cameras went dark again. And they\u2019ve stayed that way for the rest of the sit-in.Lawmakers started filming the action on Periscope again. And in a weird, full-circle moment, C-SPAN started airing the Periscope feed \u2014 apparently a first for C-SPAN.", "answers": {"answer_start": [2518], "text": ["the cameras were off"]}, "id": "4pecyw"}, {"question": ".@BreneBrown on the most valuable gift you can give to another person", "context": "Bestselling author Dr. Brene\u0301 Brown is a research professor who has spent more than a decade studying vulnerability and worthiness. She says opening yourself up is one of the most powerful things you can do -- but during her appearance on \"Oprah\u2019s Lifeclass,\"she warns that not everyone should be trusted.\"How do you make yourself be vulnerable with somebody you don't completely trust, like in a relationship?\" an audience member asks in the above video.\"You don't,\" Brown answers.\"Because you know what? This is it,\" she says, gesturing to her heart. \"What's under here is the most valuable thing you have. It's the most valuable gift you give to all of us. It's the most valuable offering you have in your life and people have to earn the right see it. They have to earn the right to see it and they have to know when they're seeing it that it's an absolute honor and privilege for you to have let them in.\"Oprah points to a similar question she and Brown received on Twitter: \"How do you foster an environment of #vulnerability when your partner sees it as #weakness?\"\"If you're being vulnerable, you're opening up your heart, and the other person thinks that that's weak of you -- you are with the wrong person,\" Oprah says.\"It's an awesome filter,\" Brown agrees.As an example, Brown tells a story of a time she tried to be vulnerable with one of the mothers at her daughter's school.\"I was talking to someone and I was like, 'Oh, yeah, last year there was a whole week where every day I gave the wrong kid the wrong lunch half the time,'\" Brown shares. \"And she looked at me and she goes, 'Oh, I don't think I've ever had that experience.'\"\"And I was, like, off the list, baby!\" Brown says.Though in this case it was easy for Brown to see that this woman didn't deserve her vulnerability, she goes on to say that in other cases, it can be painful.\"Here's what's scary, and we should not B.S. you about this,\" Brown says. \"You start trying this on,\" she says -- meaning becoming more authentic and vulnerable -- \"there will be a pushback. You're going to freak out some people. You're going to scare some people.\"By showing your vulnerability to someone, Brown explains that you're asking that person to be vulnerable in return. \"The pushback will be, what are you doing?

There is a big difference there. Of course no one wants to have sex with some chick who\u2019s fucked all 53 guys on an NFL roster, so naturally this number is going to be substantially lower than our own hopes and dreams.The study even concluded that...Any number above 20 was considered a turn-off, chosen by 3 per cent of women and 4 per cent of men.Yeah, dipshits, it is a turn-off to know that about a person, but is a guy who has slept with 100 chicks turned-off by his own actions?

She can feel it.\"The heat is so bad that my doctor said to me, \u2018You cannot go out in the heat,\u2019\" she said. \"I see older people with umbrellas. I see people who have to hold onto the gate for a while to catch their breath. This is climate change. It\u2019s going to get worse.\"Sunset Park, Brooklyn. CREDIT: WikipediaMaya isn\u2019t alone. Poll after poll after poll after poll after poll finds Hispanics and Latinos are more likely to acknowledge the climate is changing, worry about the threat, and support policy to slow the rise in temperature \u2014 even though they are less likely to identify as environmentalists. Why?One possibility is that Latinos tend to lean left and vote Democrat. But even among Democrats, people of color are more likely to believe climate change should be a top priority for policymakers.Among Americans of color, Hispanics and Latinos stand out: Several polls \u2014 see here, here and here \u2014 find they are more likely to support pro-climate policy than African Americans, even though they are less likely to identify as liberal or Democrat.There a few guesses as to why this is the case. Foreign-born Latinos may care more because they have strong ties to countries that are threatened by climate change. Central America, the Caribbean, and Mexico are acutely vulnerable to heat, drought coastal flooding. Severe heat is worsening pollution in Mexico City, making the air almost unbreathable.Analysis from Pew suggests the lurking variable is age. \"With a median age of 27 years, Hispanics are significantly younger than whites (42), blacks (33) and the nation as a whole (37). Overall, younger Americans are more likely than older Americans to say the Earth is warming because of human activity.\"It is difficult to tease the signal from the noise. The more you slice and dice the numbers, the harder it becomes to make inferences about any particular group. In surveys of American adults, Hispanics typically make a up a small subset of the data.The key variable may not be age or country of origin, but rather who stands on the front lines of climate change and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 who doesn\u2019t.Feeling the brunt of climate changeIn a recent study, Maryland residents were asked about their perceptions of climate risks. Vulnerable groups saw themselves as being more at risk to the impacts of climate change.\"Historically socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, such as Hispanics, Latinos, and African Americans, may face higher exposure to environmental risks and have less capacity to adapt,\" Karen Akerlof, George Mason University social scientist and the study\u2019s lead author, said.Even when controlling for ideology and acceptance of climate change, Akerlof explained, \"we find that Hispanics and Latinos are significantly more likely [than whites] to think that they themselves and their households are at risk from the health effects of climate change.\"Los Angeles on a smoggy day. CREDIT: WikipediaHispanics are more likely to live in cities, near polluting factories, power plants and refineries. According to a report from the National Hispanic Medical Association, they are more likely to suffer from asthma or other bronchial maladies as a result. Owing to the urban heat island effect, Hispanics are also more vulnerable to heat waves\u2014 a threat compounded, oftentimes, by limited access to air conditioning or medical care.\"In many cases, we\u2019re talking about people who are in lower income brackets and live in urban areas that are potentially prone to high heat indexes,\" said Akerlof. \"These are obviously populations of concern.\"\"These are obviously populations of concern.\"Just as relevant as the statistics regarding who feels vulnerable to climate change is who doesn\u2019t. Akerlof pointed to a series of studies highlighting the \"white male effect.\" Again and again, studies find that white men are more likely to dismiss the risks of climate change. White men tend to earn more money. They tend to be more conservative. In general, they feel less vulnerable to environmental risks and are less likely to support environmental regulation. It would appear that white men oppose changing a system that largely benefits white men.\"What you\u2019re seeing there is that basically everybody else is normal. White males are abnormal,\" said Akerlof. \"They\u2019re not recognizing the true risks because they\u2019re so invested in the system that they do not want to see anything that would threaten the current status quo.\"Cesar Chavez, 1972.

But feeding your friend\u2019s adopted baby after the loss of your own infant is more than gracious \u2014 it\u2019s entirely selfless. This story of a grieving mom deciding to donate breast milk to her friend is so deeply moving, and something not every mom would have the strength to do.Today contributor Lauren Casper told the heartbreaking and incredibly touching story of friend Sarah Rieke\u2019s decision to donate her breast milk to Casper\u2019s adopted daughter Arsema. The friends were expecting their children together, with Casper awaiting adoption of a baby girl from Ethiopia and Rieke 20 weeks pregnant. The day of the \"big\" ultrasound, the friends excitedly anticipated news of the little one\u2019s sex.Casper writes, \"I was secretly hoping for the news to come back that she was having a girl. I was dreaming about our daughters being great friends, just like their big brothers are. The text came... girl... but there were complications.\"As it turned out, those complications weren\u2019t compatible with life and as Casper says, \"I prepared my nursery for the homecoming of my daughter and Rieke planned a funeral.\" Yet, her friend was still supportive, even in this time of unimaginable grief. She writes, \"We spent a lot of mornings together crying and talking and even laughing at times. She threw me a baby shower and gave me two blankets out of a packet of four... the other two would be wrapped around her daughter after she was born.\"Shortly after Arsema was brought home from Ethiopia, her friend approached her with a heartfelt offer. Rieke said, \"I was wondering if you would like to have my breast milk after Evie is born. I thought maybe you could use it to feed Arsema. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll pump or how much I\u2019ll be able to produce, but I\u2019d love to give it to you if you want it.\"Rieke\u2019s daughter, named Evie Caris, was born the month after Arsema came home and lived for just four hours. Only a week after her baby passed, the grieving mom made good on her offer and started bringing milk to her friend\u2019s baby every week. Of the selfless act, Casper wrote, \"Each time I filled Arsema\u2019s bottle and sat in the rocker to feed her I would think about Sarah and Evie. I would pray for Sarah\u2019s broken heart and thank God for the gift Sarah had so selflessly given me and my daughter.\"She further explains that her friend wanted to do something \"meaningful\" and it seemed pumping for Arsema was healing for her in a way, as she grieved the loss of her own baby girl. In giving Arsema her milk, she provided a gift Casper couldn\u2019t give her children. \"She knew one of the painful losses of infertility and adoption was my inability to breastfeed my children. They each had such a rough start in life and I wish I could have been able to at least give them that.\"To some, it might be hard to understand how a mom could have pumped milk for another baby only days after losing her own, but if you\u2019re a parent, her probably reasons come into focus rather quickly. She likely wanted a connection to her child and to feel she had some impact on the world, no matter how small. By pumping the milk that was meant for her daughter and allowing it to nourish another baby, it kept Evie\u2019s memory alive in some way. And gave a beautiful gift to a friend, establishing a bond they\u2019ll have for the rest of their lives.Of Rieke\u2019s selfless act, Casper writes, \"I wish I could have breastfed my children. Sarah wishes she could have fed her daughter (and so do I... oh so do I). But life doesn\u2019t always make sense.

How do highly successful people maintain their motivation and continue to chase their toughest goals through an entire year?A reader named John recently contacted me with a similar question. He wrote, I'm currently working in investment management, a challenging job and a competitive environment that requires extra hours. Also, studying for the CFAan average of two to three hours a day for six months. This is doable without any doubt, but how can someone keep the same energy and motivation?At this time of year, you may be asking a similar question. Perhaps you're reflecting on the past year and wondering why you weren't able to stay focused on your goals from 11 months ago. Or perhaps you're planning your New Year's Resolution for 2017 and wondering how you'll stay motivated long enough to actually accomplish it.Many Ways To Drive MotivationThey say, success leaves clues and I've had the opportunity to spend time with many self-made millionaires, Olympians, Marine Corps generals, Fortune 500 CEOs, Navy SEALS, Congressmen, and countless other high achievers. But before I reveal the single most effective motivation technique, let me acknowledge that there are many things that can help you drive and maintain motivation. For example:Goal Setting And The Goldilocks Rules goal setting is one of the most powerful psychological tools we have, but the trick is in setting the right The great thinker and writer James Clear calls this the Goldilocks Rule. If your goal is too hard, it will lose its power as you consciously or unconsciously determine it's just unrealistic. If you set your goal too low, it will also lose its power as you will assume you'll hit it no matter what. As Clear writers, humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.Higher Purpose Despite the innate power of goal setting, a longer lasting fuel for motivation is having a higher purpose. Simon Sinek has popularized the concept of knowing your Why. It's your true purpose or belief that inspires you. Whether your motivation is to lose weight, stop smoking, get out of debt or launch a new business, ask yourself why you want to do that. In fact, ask several why's in a row and you might be surprised at your answer.Accountability Partner who can help you to keep your commitments? It's easy to break a promise to yourself, but far harder to admit your failure to a friend or colleague. Ideally, your partner is on the journey with you. Perhaps a running buddy who meets you in the park at 6:00 AM, or a fellow writer who tracks her daily word counts. But even an independent observer can sway your behavior. I have my assistant ask daily, Did you work out? How many clean meals did you eat? How many hours did you write? How many thank you notes did you send out? She actually tracks my data on an Excel spreadsheet and shares back the results and trends each month.The #1 Way To Stay MotivatedWhile there are many great tools to drive and maintain motivation, one is more important than all the others. What is it?Prime your body.The reality is that you live inside your body. Motivation, a mental state, is influenced by environment. And the environment of your mind is your body.Think about it: how motivated do you feel when you have a high fever? How motivated do you feel when you have stomach flu? How motivated do you feel when you have a migraine headache?Motivation can only be maintained when you feel energized physically.Four Ways To Maximize Physical EnergyFirst, focus on quality sleep not quantity of sleep. Just yesterday I was watching a Facebook Live video from fitness guru, Joe Wicks. Someone asked what he thought of pre-workout energy drinks (many hardcore workout folks drink high caffeine energy drinks to maximize their effort during their work outs). Wicks answer, The best pre-work is a good night's sleep. For my productivity book, I interviewed 13 Olympic athletes about their productivity routines and almost all of them talked about sleep as recovery.Yes, ideally you should get eight hours of sleep but for most of us, that isn't just realistic. But you can improve your deep sleep, which is the sleep cycle that is most restorative. You are likely waking up many times throughout the night without realizing it. Think of your bedroom as a sleep sanctuary. What can you do to make sure the temperature is just right, and that it's as dark and quiet as possible? Room darkening blinds are ideal, but a good sleep mask can do the trick, too. Telling your partner to keep the TV off in the bedroom is a must, and don't forget to tell your teenagers when you are going to bed so they can keep it down too.Second, drink a lot of water. When you wake up you are already about 1% dehydrated, and most of us never fully hydrate. Studies show that even mild dehydration leads to loss of focus, decision making, creativity and yes, energy. You'd be surprised at how much water you need to keep your mind at its best. Remember the phrase, half you hydration. This means you should take your body weight (in pounds) and divide it in half, and that's the number of ounces of water you should take in each day. I weigh 170 pounds right now, so I divide that by two, and get 85. I drink 85 ounces of water a day. That's a lot of water! To help, I use a Nalgene water bottle and throw a few lemon slices and cucumbers in for a bit of flavor. On the weekends I'll just carry a gallon jug of water with me throughout the day with the goal to empty it.Three, don't skip meals. Your new mantra: Food is fuel! There is probably nothing more controversial in the health and fitness world than what and when to eat. High protein diets, vegan diets, bullet proof coffee for ketosis, fasting days, so many options! For myself, if I want to optimize for motivation and energy (not rapid weight loss) I consume five small slow-carb meals a day. I used to skip breakfast thinking I was saving time and calories, then I'd binge lunch of a sandwich or slice of pizza, and wolf down a big dinner of whatever. What I experienced was wild swings of glucose the fuel for your brain as I'd go from waking up to low glucose to flooding my body with carbs, and then the inevitable carb crash. I'm at my best when I'm eating similar to a Body for Life plan or a Tim Ferriss slow-carb diet plan.Fourth, daily exercise. Don't panic, just move! You don't have to become a hardcore Crossfit'er (although kudos if you are). You don't have to spend an hour a day in a gym (although that would be awesome). You just need to move in a way that gets your heart beat way up for twenty minutes a day. For most people, a vigorous walk around the neighborhood or on the treadmill each morning does the trick. A yoga session or after work pickup basketball game is great. This isn't for long-term health benefits, although there are. You are moving for 20-minutes a day for same-day energy and clarity. Research is clear, 20-minutes of cardiovascular activity increases blood flow to the brain and gives you an immediate boost of energy, clarity, focus, and creativity.Whether you are just trying to power through long days of work and family, or you are trying to crush your New Year's resolution, to maintain mental motivation, focus on your body.--Kevin Kruse is the author of 15 Secrets Successful People Know About Time Management .", "answers": {"answer_start": [3189], "text": ["Prime your body"]}, "id": "842771262611083265"}, {"question": "Surprising guest star heading to @girlsHBO in Season 3", "context": "As if \"Girls\" fans needed any more reasons to sit on pins and needles awaiting the TV show's third season debut, Kim Gordon is here to heighten the anticipation.The Sonic Youth co-founder announced in an interview with Slate that she will be making an appearance in the next installment of Lena Dunham's ode to twentysomethings in New York City.

Have ice cream for a snack after dinner? The spoon goes with the rest of the spoons when you put it in the dishwasher. Grab a knife to make a sandwich? Toss it into the knife compartment of the basket.This way, when everything's clean and ready to be unloaded, you don't have to sort. You just grab each utensil group by the fistful and put it right into the drawer.This part of unloading the dishwasher used to be the most cumbersome to me until we worked out this (seemingly obvious) system in our household.

The first casualty of modern times came in 2008, when a New York Walmart worker was killed in a stampede of frenzied shoppers. Five years later, Walmart still hasn't paid a fine for its employee's death.In 2011, Black Friday shoppers ignored a collapsed comrade, leaving him to die as they rushed the store hunting for sales.

The grand total was $4 billion, about twice what it was supposed to cost, and more than the skyscraper adjacent to it. But there might be another record-breaking figure associated with this project. I couldn\u2019t believe how much the architect got paid.The Real Deal has a lovely graphic that breaks down the final costs of the WTC Hub. The story explains some of the budgetary increases, mostly due to the many (many) changes the design needed to undergo. Which is understandable, I think, and pretty normal for these big public projects. So some of these figures seem large, but reasonable. $355 million to integrate the subway line? Okay. $32.1 million for a skylight? Fine, I guess. But then you get to the design fees.According to The Real Deal, architect Santiago Calatrava was paid $80 million to design the WTC Hub. The total design fees were $408.5 million. Calatrava\u2019s cut was $80 million. For perspective, $80 million is the adjusted-for-inflation cost to build Grand Central Terminal.I\u2019ve written about architecture for a long time, and I\u2019ve tried very hard to think about another project that so famously ballooned over budget.

In light of Farrah Abraham's inability to distinguish between feminism and small birds lesbianism, we did some research on other famous ladies who need a little help with the positive and empowering meaning of the term. There are plenty of female celebrities who are proud to advocate for the advancement of women, but not so proud to call themselves feminists. In many cases, it's unclear whether they are unsure what the word means or perhaps just afraid to say it. We've rounded them up for your ideological scrutiny. But first, let's go over some \"f-word\" FAQs.Can you just give me a definition of feminism? Well, feminism refers to a nexus of ideological movements, and applying a strict definition can be constricting if not reductive, but a clear definition explains the term as \"the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men.\" The key word here is \"advocacy\" insofar as it encourages the advancement of women. Wait, so are feminists mostly lesbians who don't shave their armpits?I really don't see what about that definition I just gave could possibly make you ask about armpits, but: no. There are hairy lesbian feminists, but the term has literally nothing to do with physical appearance (or lack of shaving). I also heard something about all feminists being pimply sluts. Is that true?Pretty sure you made the pimply part up. Also, no. One major aspect of the feminist movement is the fight against slut-shaming or the oppression of women's ability to express their sexuality in a male-dominated culture. There are a number of double standards, perhaps the most prevalent being the idea that a man who is sexually active is a \"pimp,\" and a woman who is sexually active is a \"whore.\" That's some real crap!Totally agree. Wait, but ... if that's true, and feminists aren't hairy lesbian sluts, then this kind of sounds like a good thing!It is definitely is! Yeah, but then why do so few people call themselves feminists?I'm so glad you asked. See, the thing is, \"feminism\" is plagued by a negative stigma that often persists even for those who work as advocates for women. A lot of it boils down to fear of a word, and that becomes problematic for the spreading of the idea. Some really great lady people seem to be either ignorant or concerned about their reputation when it comes to placing a label on their actions. Really? Like who?Well, as Salon noted, there are a few. A number of celebrities would rather be called \"humanists,\" and many are just hesitant, but some are proud to call themselves the \"f-word.\"Here are some strong celebrity women who have shared their relation to the word \"feminism\":Katy Perry: \"I am not a feminist, but I do believe in the strength of women.\"Carrie Underwood: \"I wouldn't go so far as to say I am a feminist, that can come off as a negative connotation. But I am a strong female.\"Madonna: \"I\u2019m not a feminist, I\u2019m a humanist.\"Hmm, where have we heard that before?Sarah Jessica Parker: \"I took a page from [the playwright] Wendy Wasserstein's book. She said 'I'm not a feminist, I'm a humanist.'\"Demi Moore: \"I am a great supporter of women, but I have never really thought of myself as a feminist, probably more of a humanist because I feel like that\u2019s really where we need to be.\"Taylor Swift : \"I don\u2019t really think about things as guys versus girls. I never have. I was raised by parents who brought me up to think if you work as hard as guys, you can go far in life.\"Bjork:: \"[I don't identify as a feminist] because I think it would isolate me.

That Hillary ordered him kicked out of the party? You\u2019ve likely seen a lot of headlines like this in the past year. You may well have clicked on many of them. Today I\u2019d like to talk to you about how bullshit managed to infect this primary, and continues to consume our politics.The art of a headline like this is simple: I took someone beloved (Larry Sanders, who spoke so movingly at the DNC on behalf of his brother) and I combined it with a large dose of schadenfreude \u2014 the pleasure we take in other peoples\u2019 suffering. Or in this case, maybe the better word is cynicism: the pleasure we take in believing the worst about people. There are many, many people in the world who want to be told bad things about Hillary Clinton \u2014 particularly underhanded nasty things that victimize the progressive left \u2014 and that is a desire that\u2019s easy to manipulate.I could have also gone with the headline, \"You Won\u2019t Believe What Trump Ordered the RNC to do to the Khan Family!\"The art of good headline writing and image selection in order to get someone to click and go to a website is usually called \"clickbaiting,\" but I think we should call it \"bullshit curation.\" And this primary, the bullshit curators made a massive cottage industry out of your desire to read nasty things about Hillary Clinton. So much so that people still believe things that are patently untrue.Let\u2019s start with USUncut.com. Why does this website exist? Years ago, it was a tax advocacy group working against austerity measures. But last year, its founders left the organization according to their Linkedin profiles. There\u2019s no \"about\" section on the site. No masthead. No statement of purpose. A critical tenet of journalism is that you have to know who the journalists are \u2014 that they are real people whose agenda you can measure. You know who owns Fox News. You know who reports for it. You are able to draw conclusions about their agenda based on what you know about them.Sites like USUncut, however, have unclear ownership and unclear loyalties. And apart from this guy , its bullshit curators don\u2019t seem to have any social media footprint \u2014 no Facebook or Twitter presence. Maybe they are real journalists who have managed to avoid having a byline in any publication prior to USUncut. Maybe they are real people who have never made a Facebook or Twitter or LinkedIn profile \u2014 or who keep those profiles secret.Or maybe they\u2019re freelance writers hired by a click farm to gin up the most salacious headlines possible atop rehashed versions of other peoples\u2019 stories. Under the terms of \"fair use,\" journalism commenting on someone else\u2019s story is protected use of that person\u2019s story, so the game here is simple:A) Real news source breaks storyB) Write a story pulling a couple lines from the real news source and commenting on them, generally by slanting them in the direction your readers want to hearC) Add the most outrageous headline you can come up with paired with an image that feeds the interpretation your readers are likely to have of that headlineVoila! You\u2019ve taken someone else\u2019s work and made a commentary piece that people are more likely to click on because the headline is sexier than the responsible original piece.By way of example, let\u2019s look at this story:Did that actually happen? Do you know? Don\u2019t google it. Do you know if the DNC committee rejected an amendment to eliminate superdelegates? If you\u2019re like me, you likely saw this headline half a dozen times on friends\u2019 news feeds. Maybe more. You likely have lodged in your head that superdelegates are going to continue as they were this primary, no change, because the evil DNC and Hitlery Klingon blocked any reform or change.But that\u2019s not what happened. Both campaigns worked together and compromised and have formed an ongoing committee to change the rulesCould there be any headline less sexy than \"ongoing committee to change the rules is formed\"?But there is no follow up to this headline on USUncut. We got the bullshit, but none of the fact. (UPDATE! I was totally wrong! I SUCK! Here was their follow on piece which I searched for and could not find.)You probably also saw headlines like this:Remember that one? The DNC blocked EVERYTHING Sanders worked for. None of it made it into the platform. NONE. They voted down every last one of his initiatives.Well, wait a minute. Did they? Here\u2019s conservative bastion, The Nation , on how Sanders and his minority on the platform committee achieved multiple major victories in writing the platform. Victories that Sanders then recited in his speech at the DNC. Did they get everything? No. Was it super political? Yes. Did they win on more fronts than they lost? Yes. There\u2019s a lot of nuance there. Terrible for clickbait. And yet, the perception that the DNC threw all of Sanders\u2019 proposals out was so real going into the convention that many of his own supporters thought he wasn\u2019t telling the truth when he said they\u2019d created the most progressive platform in the Democratic Party\u2019s history. There weren\u2019t any follow up stories on sites like US Uncut setting the record straight, except one citing the inclusion of a $15 Minimum Wage (if you\u2019ll recall, multiple sites ran stories about how Clinton\u2019s people had killed the $15 Minimum Wage in the committee as well). Like the Dude, the bullshit abides.Bullshit curation is dangerous. Unless you are constantly reading minute to minute news, and from multiple sources, it is quite easy for these explosive headlines to stick in the consciousness and become truth. Don\u2019t believe me? Look at what has happened to the right wing in this country. They have been in a curated bullshit echo chamber for a decade, and now live in a fundamentally different reality than the rest of us, where crime goes down in the real world, but up in theirs; the Earth gets hotter in the real world, yet never changes in theirs; presidents are born in Hawaii in the real world, but are provably from Kenya in theirs.Why do the curators do it? Well, the answer seems very clear: the better and more cynical the headline and image pairing, the more clicks. The more clicks, the more revenue from the dozens of ads that appear on each page:There is real value to owning a site that can reliably drive hundreds of thousands of people to look at an article. By becoming a well-liked curator of bullshit, you get even more viewership for your bullshit, which means the bullshit has to keep coming \u2014 and in more refined form.By the end of the primary, there were many sites delivering the bullshit equivalent of pure-grade heroin.So, why have I told you all this? Because I\u2019d like to challenge you to look at news in a different way. Here are some rules:\u2022 Only believe primary sources. If you can hear a candidate saying it, the candidate said it. Don\u2019t believe anyone\u2019s description of what the candidate meant. Judge for yourself. Listen to the words. That means:Only believe primary sources.

Should you judge Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump for the things they say? Yes. Should you decide whether you believe them? Yes. Should you read up on policies they enacted and judge them for those policies? Yes. But very importantly: should you judge them based on policies people tell you they actually believe in, but have never said they do nor have ever acted on? No. That is called a conspiracy theory.If you are on the progressive left, you are generally suspicious (I am guessing) of people trying to sell you things. The corporate media is a great example of this \u2014 they lie, many of us believe, to keep up viewership and sell ad time.It is, therefore, astonishing to me that the bullshit curators had such a powerful influence on the progressive left this cycle. Why did they write these salacious headlines? Who do they work for? It certainly seems like they\u2019re out to make a quick buck. Why aren\u2019t you more suspicious of anonymous people on the Internet telling you things than you are of Jake Tapper? It\u2019s time to grow a little more suspicious of Internet headlines, folks.Remember, only you can prevent bullshit.UPDATE: Several people have QUITE RIGHTLY called me out for only focusing on USUncut. I find them immensely irritating and so I focused on them. But by no means does that mean they\u2019re the only offender. They\u2019re probably not even the worst offender. You can find many other sites that have used this tactic \u2014 and sites that have used knee-jerk defensiveness on Hillary\u2019s behalf to drive clicks. The phenomenon I\u2019m talking about is in no way limited to sites that supported Bernie, and I should have been clearer about that. The right wing has sites doing this, the middle does, the left does. If someone is passionate on a subject, there are sites manipulating that passion to drive clicks.And I know The Nation is not a conservative bastion.

The neighbor was charging $30 for a deep freezer with a hinged lid \u2014 the kind of freezer large enough for someone to climb inside.But the neighbor said there was a caveat, she recalled to WNCN. She couldn\u2019t start using the freezer immediately because the neighbor had promised to lend it out to her church\u2019s Sunday school class for a \"time capsule\" project.The woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, says her neighbor told her the church would come to pick up the items inside the freezer, which was sealed shut with duct tape. Afterwards, the buyer was supposed to get the freezer back.So the woman waited.Three weeks passed; the church members never came.\"Nothing was adding up, so I started to become suspicious about it,\" the woman told WRAL.She was keeping the freezer plugged in in the corner of a spare bedroom, alongside houseplants, an armchair, a vacuum cleaner and spare toiletries. Last Friday, she peeled off the duct tape and looked inside.The first things the woman saw were a green sheet and a bag of kitty litter, she told WTVD.Then, her eyes landed on a human foot.\"I saw toes and a foot and ankle,\" the woman said. She slammed the freezer shut.It must be fake, she thought to herself, opening the lid again.This time, she was sure it was real.\"My heart went into my throat,\" the woman told WRAL.

The body belonged to a Goldsboro resident, but her identity is being withheld until next of kin can be notified, police said.The medical examiner determined that there were no signs of foul play and her death was natural.

A third was sent to her grandmother's for a week.This monthly struggle has been the same for generations. But unlike their mothers, aunts and grandmothers these young women have a champion, who's determined to tackle the problem.Image caption Trinitas holding a chitenge stripTrinitas is a tall, vivacious 31-year-old researcher at Blantyre's College of Medicine. When six boys but only two girls turned up for a focus group she was running at this school, she asked the teacher where they all were and was told they'd excused themselves that week because they were menstruating.And that's a whole other tragic side to this issue: girls often don't leave the house while they're bleeding. \"So how many days of school are you missing every month?\" I ask the group.\"Five, five, six, four, five,\" they tell me.Trinitas remembers this from her own schooldays and is angry that another generation of girls is suffering. She's the daughter of a single mother and studied at a basic government school. Yet she beat the odds and made it to university - thanks, she says, to her mother's insistence on the value of education.With that in mind Trinitas bought an old treadle sewing machine and started making reusable sanitary pads from fabrics available locally. She's been doing market research at the school and the girls have all tried out her pads.The feedback is resoundingly positive. \"They're so easy to wash!\" says one girl. \"The top layer is lovely and fleecy so they're comfortable,\" says another.Trinitas's challenge is to get capital investment in this chronically poor country - enough to scale up production and bring down the price so it's low enough for the average Malawian.The girls are clearly excited by the new freedom this product could afford them. \"The wings and the poppers mean I can move around as usual,\" chirps one. \"We can do skipping rope and everything.\"And with that I'm reminded that these schoolgirls deserve better than a week of discomfort and humiliation every single month.", "answers": {"answer_start": [4012], "text": ["reusable sanitary pads"]}, "id": "4lwr9u"}, {"question": "'Stolen child'", "context": "Alberto Mohamed is one of about 4,000 children taken by the Indonesian authorities in the 1980s and 1990s, during Indonesia's brutal occupation of East Timor.Now a local NGO is trying to reunite them with their families.", "answers": {"answer_start": [0], "text": ["Alberto Mohamed"]}, "id": "845430985252618241"}, {"question": "Amy Schumer gave her 'Hamilton' bartenders an extremely generous tip", "context": "Over the weekend, actress and comedian Amy Schumer got to see Hamilton, enjoyed a few drinks and left her bartenders an extremely generous tip.The comedian left a $1,000 tip in addition to her $77.00 drink bill.

It's also considering a feature to warn drivers about routes that go through high-crime neighborhoods.Users in Los Angeles (and soon in New Orleans) will get an alert that their Waze has changed how it maps their route to work.The app will no longer direct drivers to cross over or turn through busy intersections that lack a stop sign or a light, reports CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave.In what some Waze users call a \"suicide straight,\" the app would sometimes direct drivers across multiple lanes of heavy traffic. Another concern for some is when Waze suggests a left turn through that same multi-lane traffic without a light.But Waze's Amber Kirby says, not anymore. Starting first in Los Angeles, the app may sacrifice a little time for safety.When CBS News drove with the new feature in Santa Monica, Waze had us turn left on a lightly-trafficked side street instead of across the much busier Lincoln Boulevard, sending us to a stop sign and a less stressful right turn.\"Do you guys have a sense for what this is going to do to people's commute?\" Van Cleave asked. \"How much longer is it going to make my drive to work?\"\"If you are commuting 40 minutes to an hour, maybe it adds a couple minutes here and there,\" Kirby said.\"Do you worry that some people are going to say, 'But you're supposed to save me time. And now you're costing me two minutes?'\" Van Cleave asked.\"They can then either opt to turn it off, or they can make the turn anyway. ... Waze will reroute you,\" Kirby explained.That's one of several changes the Waze team is considering.In Brazil, an elderly woman was murdered after she entered an incorrect address and was routed into a neighborhood known for gang violence.The company is now working on what could be a controversial next step, a new feature in that country to alert drivers about routes through high-crime areas.\"We're working with the government, we're working with local community groups who are able to identify which neighborhoods have safety issues,\" Waze head of brand Julie Mossler said.\"How do you do that in a way that isn't labeling a community or a neighborhood a 'bad neighborhood'?\" Van Cleave asked.\"Sometimes it's a choice of words. So, 'dangerous' is sort of a judgment, whereas 'high-crime' is factual,\" Mossler said.Mossler said the feature would use crime data verified by a third party and could also be supported by data the app gathers from users, including reports of accidents, incidents and police presence.\"Crime data is notoriously unreliable,\" Ezekiel Edwards from the American Civil Liberties Union said.\"People would be relying on flawed data to make decisions about where to drive and where not to drive, with whom to engage and with whom not to engage, perhaps where to spend money, where not to spend money ... and further perpetuate inequalities among neighborhoods as a result,\" he added.But Waze's Mossler said the company takes a risk in not acting, \"so we don't really have a choice.\"\"Of course there's a risk, if you don't handle it correctly, and that's why it's gotta be done with deep sensitivity, and I think we've done that so far,\" Mossler said.That high-crime filter could be launched before the Brazil Olympics. Right now, there's no timeline for it to come to the U.S.As for difficult intersections, this will be a default setting, so you'll have opt out if you don't want it. How much time it adds to a commute will depend on how long your commute is.

This bill came about after the surprisingly short six-month sentence of Brock Turner for three counts of felony sexual assault (he was let out after three months for good behavior).The bill is now awaiting California Governor Jerry Brown\u2019s signature to become law \u2013 but there has been a considerable amount of backlash from a group one would generally expect to see in favor of harsher penalties: feminists.A coalition of 25 feminist organizations have submitted a letter to Governor Brown, urging a veto.From their letter:As student survivors of gender violence and their allies, we respectfully request that you veto AB 2888, which would institute a mandatory minimum sentence for any defendant found guilty of sexually assaulting an unconscious or intoxicated person.We know firsthand that the consequences of rape are no less damaging for a victim who is unconscious than for a victim who is not. We also know that mandatory minimum-term laws are a harmful, mistaken solution to our rightful anger over the Brock Turner case and the many others like it.Over the latter half of the 20th century, mandatory minimum laws have led to overly punitive sentencing and prison overcrowding. While some support this legislation in hopes that it will address racial biases in sentencing that worked in Turner\u2019s favor, mandatory minimums have in fact exacerbated racial and class disparities in prosecution. Further, mandatory minimums can deter victims\u2014the vast majority of whom were assaulted by a friend, partner, or family member\u2014from reporting an assault and seeking resources. When survivors do come forward, mandatory minimums deter prosecutors from pressing charges against particular defendants\u2014namely those who, like Turner, are white and wealthy\u2014and make juries less likely to convict. Furthermore, mandatory minimum laws have failed to reduce assault. (Indeed, studies show that the severity of sanction does not deter violence.)Groups that signed the letter include Know Your IX, ACT for Women & Girls, Campus Assault Reponse (James Madison University), FIRSST (Goshen College), National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, National Resource Center on Domestic Violence, Social Justice Club (University of Wisconsin), URGE, UltraViolet, and many others.President of Brooklyn College, Michelle Anderson, stated \"I oppose the legislation,\" and \"I hope he [Governor Jerry Brown] does veto it....I think we have a history in this country of overreacting and overusing the criminal justice system. Feminists have been saying for years that mandatory punishments are not the right response to sexual violence.\"As a California resident, feminist activist, and opponent of the terrible way our criminal (in)justice system has been used to abuse our citizens, I have written to Governor Brown urging him to veto this bill.

Despite being Apple\u2019s first foray into a young new product category, estimates since the device\u2019s launch have been very positive. Apple\u2019s smartwatch quickly outsold every other smartwatch on the market, and sales are thought to have continued at a strong pace throughout the Watch\u2019s first year on the market.According to analysts\u2019 consensus ahead of Apple\u2019s fiscal second-quarter earnings report on Tuesday, Apple is thought to have sold between 12 million and 13 million Apple Watches during the device\u2019s first year of availability, The Wall Street Journal noted .

Wouldn't it be nice to escape political turmoil, climate change, overpopulation, and nuclear proliferation? Wouldn't it be nice to move, with a few family members and friends, to a welcoming virgin world?Hollywood makes it seem easy. We strap in aboard our starliner, and the craft gently lifts off. A button is pushed. The star field distorts. The ship slips into a wormhole, and we take a shortcut through space-time to arrive in a new planetary system and a blue-green oasis.In reality, things aren't that simple. We don't know how to create a wormhole. Warping space requires immense energies \u2014 and forms of matter that might not exist. Space is so vast that if we were to depend on the conventional chemical propulsion systems that have taken us to the moon and other planets in our solar system, a voyage to the stars would last tens of thousands of years.It's so frustrating! Just as astronomers locate potentially habitable planets around nearby stars, we're reminded of the difficulty of visiting these worlds.Someday humans may be able to develop interstellar spacecraft powered by antimatter or fluctuations in the universal vacuum. (Antimatter combined with normal matter would be the most energetic possible rocket fuel. Tapping the universal vacuum implies a near-infinite energy source, if this proves possible.) But for now, let's limit our view to proposed interstellar spacecraft powered by innovative propulsion techniques that do not violate the laws of physics as we now understand them.The first realistic possibility, initially proposed in 1968 by physicist Freeman Dyson, was a craft powered by successive explosions of hydrogen bombs (separated from the crew compartment by colossal shock absorbers). The proposed spacecraft, dubbed Project Orion, was huge, with dimensions measuring in kilometers. Powered by the entire thermonuclear arsenals of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, Dyson calculated, it would have been capable of sending thousands of human colonists to the Alpha/Proxima Centauri system (at 4.3 light-years from Earth, the closest star system) within 1,000 years or so.Starting in the 1970's, scientists at the British Interplanetary Society and its offshoots, including the Institute for Interstellar Studies, proposed a series of interstellar probes and huge human-carrying space arks bearing classical names such as Daedalus and Icarus. These were essentially sanitized versions of Dyson's Orion: Instead of hydrogen bombs, these conceptual craft were to have been propelled by small pellets of nuclear fusion fuel ignited by lasers or electron beams.These proposed craft were supposed to have been able to reach Alpha/Proxima Centauri within centuries. But the fusion apparatus would be massive. It would be difficult to fund preliminary developmental in-space experiments because of the immense ship sizes required.In the late 1970s, scientists started thinking about interstellar craft powered by not by chemical or nuclear processes but by \"propellantless\" systems. One of the most promising ideas is for craft propelled by the propulsive force of sunlight falling on a thin, highly reflective \"sail.\" Calculations indicate that such a system, pushed to its technological limits, could propel a robotic payload to Alpha/Proxima Centauri within only a few centuries. Human-carrying arks, whose speed would be bound by our bodies' limited ability to withstand the high g forces of rapid acceleration, would take about 1,000 years to complete the same journey.Unfortunately, the solar-photon sail has its limits. One is the inverse-square nature of solar luminosity: With every doubling of a ship's distance from the sun, its acceleration would fall by a factor of four.But there may be a way around this limitation.During the next decade, a Silicon Valley billionaire named Yuri Milner intends to invest $100 million in the Breakthrough Initiative Project Starshot. His idea is to attach a tiny robotic payload to a super-thin, highly reflective sail measuring only about 100 square centimeters and hit it with a multi-gigawatt laser beam generated by a huge facility here on Earth. If scientists can find a way to keep it in the powerful beam for a few minutes without melting, it would fly off at a velocity sufficient to reach Alpha Centauri in a few decades.This is all very challenging. We'll need to figure out how to keep the tiny sail stable in the powerful beam without melting, maintaining the beam on target during the multi-minute acceleration run, and reconfiguring the tiny sail for both interstellar cruise and encounter with the Centauri system \u2014 but it is by no means impossible. And at least for now, it may be our best chance we \u2014 or, rather, robots \u2014 have for reaching the stars.Greg Matloff is a professor in Physics at New York City College of Technology, CUNY, a consultant with NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, a Hayden Associate of the American Museum of Natural History, a Member of the International Academy of Astronauts, and a leading expert in possibilities for interstellar propulsion.

But sometimes, there are some who can inspire humanity through their selfless acts of giving that can cross boundaries of caring for children other than their own.

Certified to adopt from the age of 25. Lacey Dunkin from California took a huge step in life and despite of not being married, enrolled herself to become a foster parent. But she never realized what the future would bring by that one step of selflessness.1 Lacey Badly Wanted To Be a MotherFor Lacey becoming a mother was one of the most beautiful experiences of her life. And she loved kids and always wanted to have them. Although she did marry and had kids of her own, it was when she was younger that the eventful journey of being a foster mom began. Within four months of registering for adoption, she received a call to adopt four little girls, all sisters. Among Sophia, Natalia, Melanie and Kaylee, existed a fifth sibling a new born baby who unfortunately was given away to another foster home.Although Lacey was overwhelmed because here was not just one but four!! She said a big YES!!

There's certainly no sense that Imperioli doesn't want to talk about Gandolfini -- in fact, he mentioned Gandolfini's name first -- but it's obvious that speaking about the late actor is hard for former friends and colleagues.I was wary to discuss \"The Sopranos\" at all with Imperioli (who, of course, played mobster Christopher Moltisanti on David Chase's acclaimed show) out of fear that since the subject comes up so many times in his day-to-day life he may just be over it by now. This is not the case. Imperioli's eyes light up as he recounts tale after tale -- including an admission that he wasn't a huge fan of the first script.Imperioli, who I met at his lower Manhattan hotel room, is now co-starring in Spike Lee's \"Oldboy.\" He plays Chucky, a bar owner who helps his childhood friend, Joe (Josh Brolin), on a mysterious quest to find out who has imprisoned Joe for the last 20 years. The results are ... well, not really what you would expect (unless you've seen the Korean film on which \"Oldboy\" is based).Did you audition for \"Oldboy,\" or was the role offered?Spike called me -- I had worked for him a bunch of times. And he called out of the blue and had assumed that I had already gotten the offer from my agent, which I didn't. So he called and said, \"I'm really psyched we're working together again.\" And I'm like, \"What? What are we doing?\" He's like \"Oldboy! You're playing Josh Brolin's best friend.\" I said, \"Spike, I don't know what you're talking about.\"It's interesting when Spike Lee makes a kind of movie that isn't what he is most known for doing.Yeah, he is a filmmaker. Because when he started out, he was identified with being a \"black filmmaker.\" He was telling these stories and they were mostly black characters. They weren't necessarily, like, \"She's Gotta Have It,\" could be any race, it doesn't matter. Because he really was at the forefront of a new kind of generation of cinema where a lot more African Americans were going to be making films. Originally, they started calling him \"the black Woody Allen,\" and he probably hated that title. But, that's only a part of who he is ... he's a lot of things and over the years, we've seen that his filmmaking and his art encompasses all of those things.Did you watch the original movie?No. This one I haven't seen, either. I'm going to see it at the screening tonight here in New York, then I will see the original.There's something I've always wondered. On \"The Sopranos\" you were playing younger...Yeah, my character was younger than me.After \"The Sopranos\" ended, did that ever affect you for other roles? That people assumed you were younger?I think people always thought I was more of a Guido than I am. That's more the issue.They knew you were acting, right?Not necessarily. They kind of thought it was more like \"Jersey Shore\" when it came out.What?I'm not kidding! I think a lot of people thought that we were not necessarily even actors -- that they had found us in New Jersey and put us on television. I think a lot of people had that perception.Not after it had been on for awhile, right?No, no. At the beginning.That's insane.A lot of people are insane [laughs]. And then they'd meet me and they would be kind of disappointed that they weren't meeting Christopher.That's fascinating.Sad but true.Like a lot of people, I recently watched all of \"The Sopranos\" again. It was better than I even remembered it was.Obviously David Chase's vision of the whole thing, it's beyond brilliant -- and really, really creative and amazing. But, in addition to that, I think the fact that it's really funny. Like really. Like pee in your pants funny. And in an absurd, sometimes even slapstick way, which is great. But, there's this kind of magic that happened with \"The Sopranos\" because a lot of the actors, for me, I knew and had worked with most of those people.Two of the actors, John Ventimiglia and Sharon Angela -- Johnny played Artie and Sharon played Rosalie Aprile -- I was in acting school with them when I was a teenager. I had done movies with Vinnie Pastore and Tony Sirico, and I know Edie Falco, we had done some stuff together. So, in some sense, it was kind of like this generation of New York actors having this moment to do it together, like as a band. Rather than something that was cast in Hollywood and you got a bunch of good actors and made a good TV show. So, there was that other added element of magic that I think happened.You've been on television shows since then. Can you tell when that magic is missing?When I read the pilot of \"The Sopranos,\" I wasn't terribly blown away by it. I'll be honest with you.Really?Number one, I needed a job at the time. Number two, there really wasn't big shows on cable. Yeah, I thought it was a good character, it was kind of fun, but I wasn't so clear on the tone of the show. I thought it was more of a spoof of the mob. So, if you just read the pilot, you don't really get a sense of how deep he was going to go, David Chase. I knew it was good, but it wasn't something like, \"I have to do this,\" or that I was blown away by it.But then I saw some of the people who were going to do it -- like Edie and Lorraine [Bracco] and Vinnie and Tony. I didn't really know Jim [Gandolfini], I didn't know his work. But, when I saw those actors -- especially Edie, who was always one of my favorites and who I had a lot of respect for for a long time -- I was like, \"okay, that's cool.\" But it wasn't until we started shooting the first season when the other scripts started to come in -- when you saw, \"Oh, wow.\" The scripts kept getting better. So, it wasn't until we started seeing those scripts.You wrote a few episodes. How did that come about?I wrote a spec script after the first season, because I had really fallen in love with the show. Particularly with all of the characters. I wanted to get into the minds of the other characters. So, I wrote a spec script between the first and second season and gave it to David. And during that time, also, \"Summer of Sam\" came out -- I was one of the writers there -- and David saw that. So, between those two things...He's famously tough on his writers. Was he as tough on you, even though you were in the cast?Yeah, he was very tough -- tough on everybody. But, not in a bad way -- in a very good way. And I think the biggest thing I learned from that guy was the detail. Because, as a writer, his attention to detail and specifics was incredible. Nothing was ever generic; nothing was ever taken for granted. If ever a delivery boy shows up at the door with a pizza, it was always like, \"A Pakistani guy with a Brazil soccer jersey who has a limp shows up with a pizza\" -- and the guy has no lines! Everything was like that. Always.I just interviewed Alan Taylor for \"Thor: The Dark World\" about of all the death scenes he's directed...Alan Taylor directed \"Thor\"?\"The Dark World,\" yes. You didn't know that?No. I had no idea. That's pretty cool.But Christopher was his favorite death scene.You know, when I was 17 or 18, I worked on an NYU film and he did the sound on it. And when he came on \"The Sopranos,\" I recognized his face. I was like, \"You went to NYU, did you do this?\" He's like, \"Yeah, I was the sound guy.\" It's so weird.I don't have a question, but I just want to say that I met James Gandolfini randomly at a bar one night and he was nice to me when he didn't have to be and I never forgot that.Yeah, he was that kind of guy. You know, I think the thing with Jim was, my mom called and said, \"everyone is calling me,\" after Jim died. I said, \"Why is everyone calling you?\" She goes, \"Because everyone feels like they knew him.\" When someone like Michael Jackson dies, this huge mega-star that people are mad about, he always seemed like they worshiped him from afar. He was on this pedestal. Whereas with Jim, I think they all felt like he was one of them.And he was a big part of this city. He was just out and about everywhere.Another friend of mine who is an actor who lives in Tribeca said there was a big snowstorm and he looks out his window and he saw Jim shoveling some woman's car out of the snow. And he said, \"I feel kind of safe knowing that Jim Gandolfini lives in the neighborhood.\" And I understood what he means, because you would see him out and about. He's not someone who traveled with bodyguards in limousines.Have you seen \"Enough Said\"? It's very touching.No, I don't know if I'm going to see that. It's tough. I mean, I've seen some clips from it and it seemed like more than anything, that's closer to who he was than anything else I've seen him in.", "answers": {"answer_start": [25], "text": ["Michael Imperioli"]}, "id": "404472686274813952"}, {"question": "PC/Xbox One Cross-platform play has officially arrived in this game", "context": "PC/Xbox One Cross-Platform Play Has Officially Arrived in This GameImage: bgr.comPysonix has allowed the cross-platform play between the Xbox One and PC versions of Rocket League.

What goes into making a score for the world's biggest franchise machine? HuffPost Entertainment asked Tyler during a recent phone chat.1. Pay attention to the storyThe score for \"Thor: The Dark World\" sounds nothing like what composer Patrick Doyle did on \"Thor,\" and there's a reason for that. \"In this film, he is fully realized,\" Tyler said, noting that the God of Thunder had gone through an entire \"Thor\" movie as well as \"Marvel's The Avengers\" before landing on \"The Dark World.\" \"We needed a mature character theme, where he's regal, he's epic, and the romance with Jane [played by Natalie Portman] is kind of melancholy, because she's this mortal that he's fallen for, which could not be further from his side of the train tracks.\"2. Take advantage of your settingUnlike \"Thor,\" which put the title character on Earth for much of its length, \"Thor: The Dark World\" keeps the major focus on Asgard, his home planet. \"There's spaceships and lasers. So you have that element of the 'Star Wars' influence, which we all grew up with,\" Tyler said. \"It's science-fiction, but within it they wear capes and fight with swords and ride horses. There's almost a 'Lord of the Rings' feeling as well. The music had to reflect these things. Those were not elements really present as much in the first one. So it required something different. I think my score for 'Thor: The Dark World' would have been out of place in the first film and vice versa.\"3. Listen to Marvel\"Marvel wants themes that are recognizable and that kind of, more or less, give a branding, personality and a musical thematic hook [to these characters] that you can hang your hat on, post-'Avengers,'\" Tyler said.Not that collaborating with Marvel is a chore. \"I love working with them. Kevin Feige is someone I feel simpatico with,\" Tyler said. \"I just really feel he always has the best interests of the film at heart. We're just trying to make films that we would love to watch ourselves. I was a fan long before working with them. A lot of the people at Marvel now were just like me: kids who grew up collecting Marvel comics.\"4. Give the audience nostalgiaIf the theme from \"Thor: The Dark World\" sounds familiar, that's intentional. \"Something that I find is the hardest thing about composing, but also the most rewarding, is writing something that instantaneously has nostalgia,\" Tyler said. \"You want it to fit so well that the audience thinks it always had to be that way.\"5.

But by studying the many fossils of this enigmatic reptile, Tyler Lyson from the Denver Museum of Nature and Science has devised a fascinating new idea about turtle origins . He thinks that their iconic shells evolved not for defense, but for digging. They anchored the powerful arm strokes needed to shift soil and sand. Before turtles became impregnable walking fortresses, they were professional burrowers.Travel back in time to 260 million years ago, just before the dawn of the dinosaur era. Journey to what is now South Africa, and make your way to a river bank. Then, wait. If you\u2019re lucky, you might see a small, hand-sized creature poking its head out of the mud. It looks like a fat lizard, with bulging flanks and stocky legs. But if you managed to grab it and flip it over, you\u2019d find that its flanks are bulging because its ribs are exceptionally wide, broad, and flat, reinforcing its undersides. It\u2019s almost like the little creature has half a shell.First, the lower ribs became wider and fused with each other to give half a shell\u2014the plastron. Then, the upper ribs followed suit and merged with the spine, creating the carapace. (This means that, contrary to cartoons, you can\u2019t pull a turtle out of its shell.) Eventually, through an intricate bit of evolutionary origami , the ribs started growing over the shoulder blades, rather than sitting below them as in you, me, and most other land-living vertebrates.Once paleontologists knew what one intermediate turtle might look like, they found new ones like Pappochelys . They also added existing fossils like Eunotosaurus to the family; ironically, it had been previously ruled out as an early turtle because it lacked osteoderms. With these fossils, scientists could reconstruct the evolution of the shell.Everything changed in 2008, when Chinese researchers discovered a 220-million-year-old turtle with a shell that covered just its belly and not its back. They called it Odontochelys semitestacea \u2014literally, the \"toothed turtle in a half-shell.\" It was as beautiful an intermediate fossil as they could have hoped for. And strikingly, it had no osteoderms at all. It did, however, have very broad ribs. The developmental biologists were right!It didn\u2019t help that for the longest time, the oldest known turtle was a creature called Proganochelys , which already had a fully developed (and very spiky) shell, meaning it couldn\u2019t tell us anything about how that structure first arose.For almost a century, biologists argued about how turtles got their shells\u2014a debate almost as slow and plodding as the creatures themselves. Paleontologists mostly argued that the shells evolved from bony scales called osteoderms, which are also responsible for the armor of crocodiles, armadillos, and many dinosaurs. These scales simply expanded to fuse with the ribs and backbone, creating a solid covering. But developmental biologists disagreed. By studying modern turtle embryos, they deduced that the shell evolved from ribs, which broadened out and eventually united.That takes care of how the shell evolved. \"For me, the next question was: Why?\" says Lyson. \"And there are two huge reasons why not.\"First, the ribs and their associated muscles help to inflate and deflate the lungs. If you broaden and fuse your ribs, you compromise your ability to breathe. Second, if you\u2019re a reptile, you also become slower. Reptiles have a sprawling gait, so they bend their bodies sideways to increase the length of their stride. They effectively walk with their entire trunks, which you can see in this video of a walking Komodo dragon . But wide fused ribs prevent trunks from bending, so turtles are powered only by their limbs. That\u2019s partly why they\u2019re famously slow. What benefit could a shell possibly provide that compensates for being worse at both breathing and walking?\"When I went to these turtle-specific conferences and I talked to people, they automatically said it was for protection,\" Lyson recalls. \"But that never made any sense.\" Modern turtle shells certainly make for potent defenses, but the wide ribs of Eunotosaurus and Pappochelys do not. They wouldn\u2019t even have covered the creatures\u2019 heads, necks, or backs. If protection was important, it would have made far more sense to follow crocodiles and armadillos down the osteoderm route, which wouldn\u2019t have hampered breathing or walking.So, to explain why the turtle shell evolved, you need to explain why they first started widening their ribs, despite the substantial costs of doing so. Lyson came up with a fresh answer by studying a large number of Eunotosaurus fossils. One specimen, which had been recently discovered by an eight-year-old South African boy, was especially important because it preserved the animal\u2019s entire body, including its hands and feet.Lyson noticed that Eunotosaurus had many distinctive features. It had a short, spade-shaped skull. Its hands were larger and sturdier than its feet. Its shoulder blades and forearms had large attachment points for especially buff triceps, all the better for pulling its arms back with extreme force. In short, it was built like a digger. Now the ribs made sense: they would have anchored the front legs as they scooped away at earth. They were excavation innovations.He compares the turtle shell to bird feathers\u2014complex structures that didn\u2019t evolve for their current function.Those same traits would also have made for a powerful swimmer, but Lyson found that Eunotosaurus has two features that digging requires but swimming does not: big claws for breaking up soil, and thickened bones for withstanding compressive forces. Indeed, when Lyson looked at its legs in cross-section, he found that the front pair was loaded with super thick bone, but the hind pair were not. Again, all the signs pointed to a burrowing specialist.Eunotosaurus was often found near ponds and river banks, but lived at a time when South Africa was dry. Perhaps it burrowed to escape droughts, leaving the unpredictable environment on the surface for a more stable one beneath it. Its eyes support this idea. Another newly discovered specimen of Eunotosaurus has preserved sclerotic rings\u2014bony circles that surround its eyes. By measuring these, Lyson deduced that the animal had small eyes that were likely insensitive to light. He interprets this as evidence of a life spent mostly underground.", "answers": {"answer_start": [299], "text": ["for digging"]}, "id": "4t6637"}, {"question": "Anna Kendrick Reveals The Surprising Marvel Character That She Wants To Play", "context": "Everybody wants to be a hero these days.

Despite repeated claims of rampant illegal voting, election and law enforcement officials have found no evidence that its a widespread problem. The data (or lack thereof) makes it all the more noteworthy when a case of voter fraud is discovered. A story emerged late this week about a Texas woman who was sentenced to eight years in prison, thanks to some confusion on her part on whether she was allowed to vote or not.Rosa Maria Ortega, 37, is a permanent resident of the United States who the New York Times reports was brought to America as an infant. The Times relayed a piece of her family history, and shared how she first gained the ability to vote: Ms. Ortega, a native of Monterrey, Mexico, came to Texas with her mother when she was an infant. More than a decade later, the family was scattered after the mother was arrested and deported. Two brothers born in Dallas automatically gained citizenship; Ms. Ortega became a permanent resident and gained a green card, her brother Tony Ortega, 35, said in an interview.As a Dallas County resident, she registered to vote and later cast ballots in elections in 2012 and 2014, her lawyer, [Clark] Birdsall, said. While that was illegal, there was no attempt to break the law, he maintained: Some government forms allow applicants to declare that they are permanent residents, but the voting registration form asks only whether an applicant is a citizen.Lacking the permanent resident option, he said, she ticked the 'citizen' box. When the county later mailed her a registration card, he said, she believed she 'was good to go.'The issue for Ortega was simple: people with \"permanent resident\" status are not permitted to vote in national, state, or local elections that require citizenship to cast a ballot. Exceptions to this rule in a modern setting are rare, and provisions to allow non-citizen voters to participate in local elections have often been met with dramatic pushback.Unaware of this distinction, it was Ortega's next move that raised alarm and sealed her fate:Ms. Ortega moved to neighboring Tarrant County and again registered, but this time checked a box affirming that she was not a citizen. When her application was rejected in March 2015, the trial showed, she called election officials and told them that she had previously voted in Dallas County without difficulty.Told that she could not vote unless she was a citizen, she asked for another application, and returned it with a check in the box affirming citizenship. That raised questions, and law enforcement officials arrested her on fraud charges.Ortega was close to escaping serious punishment for the offense, and her attorney supposedly set up a plea deal with Texas' attorney general, Ken Paxton. County DA Sharen Wilson axed the deal, and publicly signaled her intent to crack down on voter fraud.\"In all aspects of society, people verify their identity,\" Wilson said. \"Why not for voting? This case shows a clear need to enforce the laws we already have.\"Prior to her conviction, Ortega was a registered Republican. She voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, and in 2014 she voted for Paxton -- the man whose office would eventually prosecute her -- in his successful bid for Texas AG. The eight-year sentence and eventual deportation will have far-reaching effects on Ortega's family. Her four children, all between the ages of 13 and 16, are currently being supervised by other family members and Ortega's fiancee, the latter of whom has no legal custody of the children. President Donald Trump has doubled down on his party's insistence that voter fraud is an issue. He has publicly called for a \"major\" investigation of the 2016 election, echoing widely-discredited claims that three-to-five million illegal votes were cast last November.", "answers": {"answer_start": [527], "text": ["Rosa Maria Ortega,"]}, "id": "830571934517694469"}, {"question": "This is the most hated word in the English language, according to science", "context": "Words have the power to inform, embolden, and inspire. But very few have the power to send a cold shiver up your spine quite like the word \"moist.\" Thanks to a new piece of research, scientists might have uncovered what makes this word so uncomfortable to hear.First of all, you\u2019re not alone if you find the word aversive. The study, recently published online in PLOS One , found that around 18 percent of people have a \"categorical aversion\" to the word \"moist.\"Paul Thibodeau, a cognitive psychologist from Oberlin College, considered three different hypotheses for why the word makes so many people\u2019s skin crawl. These possible explanations were the sound of the word, the word's connotation, and the social transmission of the idea that the word is disgusting.Within a series of five experiments, Thibodeau investigated American English-speaking participants' opinion of the word \"moist,\" among other words. These included words related to bodily function (such as phlegm, puke, and vomit), clusters of words related to sex (such as f*ck, horny, and p*ssy), and words that sounded similar to \"moist\" (such as foist, hoist, and rejoiced).His study found that people who said they were averse to the word \"moist\" often pointed to the sound of the word as the source of their disgust. People who weren\u2019t averse to the word said it was its connotations to sex. However, people who didn't like the word had no problem with similar-sounding words.The study found that people who identified as categorically averse to \"moist\" also found words such as \"phlegm\" and \"vomit\" more aversive, although not words such as \"vagina,\" \"horny,\" or \"penis.\" This suggests that the word's association with bodily fluid is a strong reason for why it is so gross to so many people.The researchers also found a social element to people's aversion to the word \"moist.\" They showed one group of participants a hilarious video by People Magazine (below) that had \"the sexiest men alive\" saying the word \"moist\" in an purposely cringe-inducing and awkward context. Another group watched a \"control\" video that showed people saying \"moist\" to describe the taste of cake. People who watched the video with the word being said in a socially cringe-worthy context later expressed more disgust for the word. This suggests that our perception of the word is strongly tied to how those around us also perceive it.Due to these findings, the study concluded that our uncomfortable reaction to the word stems from our natural disgust of bodily functions. Importantly, this is strongly reinforced by social cues.While understanding this horrifically awkward word is important, there is a greater point to the study. As Thibodeau explains , the study hopes to understand how we process emotional words, as opposed to neutral words, and how this is affected by our external environment.\"Disgust is adaptive. If we didn\u2019t have an instinct to run away from vomit and diarrhea, disease would spread more easily,\" writes Thibodeau. \"But is this instinct biological or do we learn it? Does our culture shape what we find disgusting? This is a complex and nuanced question. Significant work is needed to answer it definitively. But the present studies suggest that, when it comes to the disgust that is elicited by words like 'moist,' there is an important cultural component \u2013 the symbols we use to communicate with one another can become contaminated and elicit disgust by virtue of their association with bodily functions.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [140], "text": ["moist"]}, "id": "4zqeld"}, {"question": "The CEO of an Apple supplier just seemingly confirmed one of the biggest iPhone rumors", "context": "The CEO of Catcher Technology, a major Apple supplier, has seemingly confirmed a big iPhone rumor.The current word on the street is that the iPhone 7, expected this fall, is going to be fairly boring.

Their incomes are going up much faster than anyone else's.\"In 2013, the Golden-for-some State was home to the most -- 12,560 -- ultra-wealthy individuals, according to a new report by Wealth-X, a think tank focusing on wealthy people. New York had the second most, with 8,945 ultra-wealthy individuals. Wealth-X defines ultra-wealthy as having a net worth of at least $30 million.California gained even more ultra-wealthy individuals in 2013 than any other state, adding an additional 1,605 residents. Florida gained the second most, an additional 565 more than in 2012.But California also has the highest poverty rate in the nation, according to an analysis released Wednesday by the U.S. Census Bureau. Nearly one in four Californians -- about 24 percent of the overall population -- lives in poverty. Behind California, the District of Columbia and Nevada have the second and third highest poverty rates, according to the analysis. Across the U.S., about 16 percent of Americans live in poverty.The census analysis considered income, government benefits, taxes and cost of living. The official poverty threshold for a two-adult-two-child family was $23,283 in 2012.What to do about these grim statistics? For one, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law in September the highest minimum wage in the nation, to be rolled out over the next three years. California's minimum wage will bump from $8 to $9 an hour in July 2014, and then up to $10 an hour in January 2016.Brown also fought tooth and nail last year to get voters to pass Proposition 30, which raises income taxes on the wealthiest Californians to help fund K-12 schools, community colleges and state universities.The measure is desperately needed, as California's education system ranks 36th in the nation, with a C grade, in Quality Count's 2013 report. California educates about one-eighth of the nation's students.But Prop 30 is just a temporary fix -- a \"band-aid,\" Gerston said. California's education system desperately needs more funds, and the state's poor need more social services. And getting initiatives passed that address these issues may prove to be an uphill battle, as Gerston pointed out.Part of the problem is that those at the bottom don't vote nearly as much as those at the top, Gerston said. In California, this is exacerbated because recent immigrants are even less likely to vote.But Gerston is optimistic that democracy will catch up with immigration. As more immigrants have been here for second and third generations, percentages of Latinos and Asian American voters have crept up, he said.\"You will see the legislature filled with more and more people reflecting the state's demographics,\" he said. \"The voting turnout will eventually be a majority of non-whites.\"And those non-whites and low-income Californians will vote in their own interest, as voters always do, Gerston said. \"Give this another 20 years, and you're going to see a state that's markedly different.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [0], "text": ["California"]}, "id": "401844362348204032"}, {"question": "\"Downton Abbey\" star debuts drastically different look", "context": "Earl of Grantham ... is that you?!Last night (Dec. 22), U.S. \"Downton Abbey\" fans got quite the shock when Hugh Bonneville appeared in PBS' TV movie \"Mr. Stink.\"\"Mr. Stink\" centers on the touching story of Mr. Stink (Bonneville), a homeless man who uses his foul odor as weapon of sorts, and Chloe (Nell Tiger Free), a teenage girl who befriends him.

I was complaining to my coworker about my lack of money when he told me about how people were self-publishing fiction online.This friend who had actually read my writing before, told me I might be pretty good at writing erotica. So I thought, \"Hey, maybe I can do that.\" I did my research, and wrote my first story, which was a story involving a dragon having sex with a human girl titled, \"Doing the Dragon.\"Within a month I was making more [money] writing erotica than I was at my crummy job. So I quit my job and started writing erotica full-time. I also scaled back from full-time to part-time at my college.Christie saw how much money I was making with erotica and she wanted to join in. That long and winding road has led us to become the dynamic duo of beast sex!You often hear that \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is targeted at middle-aged women. Who is the target demographic for dinosaur erotica?You know, we are not really sure. When we first started writing it, we thought we were writing it for women. Since we have published it however, we have had a lot of fan mail from both men and women of all ages. We have a few more men than women, I would say the percentage would be about 60% men /40% women. All of the readers, that we know of, seem to be between the ages of 21 and 65.Why are people aroused by dino-boning?I think it\u2019s because dinosaur erotica appeals to our more base, carnal natures. Some people also probably like the idea of a big, powerful, massive male roughly having sex with a smaller female. It\u2019s like the ultimate sexual experience with an alpha male, which is something that we are all inherently wired to enjoy. At least, I think so anyway.Your Amazon bio notes that you write \"from personal experience.\" Care to elaborate?I have loads and loads of nasty sex with T-rexes and raptors. You have no idea how long it takes to clean up the messes...OK, maybe that isn\u2019t entirely true. But actually I was raised in a fairly open-minded household and I learned about sex at a young age. Christie was the same way. Also, Christie and I are both into some of what would be considered \"kinky\" things (not together). I am into some light BDSM and a few other fetishes that I won\u2019t go into deep detail with. Christie is into some of the heavier dungeon bondage stuff as well as some \"toy play.\"But my fantasies in the bedroom have helped fuel my writer\u2019s imagination.Are the short arms of a T-rex a problem in the bedroom?Sadly yes, the shorter arms make it hard for the creature to balance himself. That limits the positions that he can take part in. Any part of the kama sutra that requires holding your partner are out of the question. That\u2019s usually fine though, the power in his hind legs more than make up for his lack of upper-body support.Short arms are also why male T-rexes are the most voracious in looking for mates. They can\u2019t \"relieve themselves\" by themselves, so they have to have someone \"help them,\" if you know what I mean.Which dino is the best cuddler?A brontosaurus, of course. Those great big longnecks are just big snuggly bears!Do dinos use protection?With each other they do. However, when it comes to interspecies relations, nah. They can\u2019t catch any puny, non-dino social diseases, and since they are a different species than who they are sleeping with, they can\u2019t get their partners pregnant (or vice-versa).All of your stories appear to be about female humans and male dinosaurs. Do you have any plans to write the reverse? What about same-sex pairings?Christie and I have very seriously thought about doing something along those lines, especially same sex pairings. We have mainly done male creature/female human because that was where the market was. However, if we try it and it does well, we will most definitely do same-sex pairings and male human/female creature stories.What's in the future for you and Christie? What comes after dinosaur erotica?Well we are planning to do a few more dinosaur erotica stories in the near future. But after that we plan to go back to doing more fantasy creature erotica.After we reach a certain number of short stories/novels, Christie and I both plan to retire from the monster porn business. Once that day comes I plan to take up writing for games again, and perhaps write science fiction, fantasy, and romance stories. Christie plans to write a series of urban fantasy novels.Where can we see more of your writing?You can see more of our writing on our Amazon author page.I am also going to start putting snippets of new stories up on my blog.

After three weeks of Lyme treatment, there are still some down days, but on other days he seems normal, she said. \"All of a sudden he was back.\"Lasting Effects PossibleLyme disease is caused by an infected blacklegged tick, also known as a deer tick. If left untreated, it can eventually cause a host of debilitating symptoms, including severe headaches, one or more rashes, stiff neck, severe joint pain and swelling, heart palpitations, facial paralysis, dizziness, nerve pain and memory loss, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Many of these patients say that medical officials pay little attention to their persisting symptoms.\u2014 Michael Specter, The New YorkerOther cognitive problems that can occur after months or even years include, according to the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center of Columbia University Medical Center:problems remembering names or wordsslowed thinking\"brain fog\"difficulty following conversations.\"My brain is so destroyed. To me it\u2019s amazing I can still get up and go to the show,\" Kristofferson told the Las Vegas Review-Journal last fall. \"But I can remember all the songs.\"The tiny arachnids are found in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, north-central and Pacific Coast areas of the United States, the CDC says.The disease may reveal itself within 30 days in a characteristic \"bull\u2019s-eye\" rash, but some people never get a rash. And since most bites come from the immature form of the tick, which is about the size of a poppy seed, the incursion can easily go unnoticed.About 300,000 people are diagnosed with Lyme disease each year, according to the CDC, and the government has recognized it as a \"major health threat.\"Ongoing ControversyThe medical establishment has been at odds for years, however, with critics who believe that Lyme is vastly under-diagnosed and under-treated. There is fierce disagreement about how reliable testing methods are and even what to call a lasting illness.\"The term \u2018chronic Lyme disease\u2019 (CLD) has been used to describe people with different illnesses,\" the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases says on its website. \"While the term is sometimes used to describe illness in patients with Lyme disease, in many occasions it has been used to describe symptoms in people who have no evidence of a current or past infection with [the Lyme bacterium].\"Because of the confusion in how the term CLD is employed, experts in this field do not support its use,\" the agency says.That angers those who say conventional doctors ignored their complaints.\"Many of these patients say that medical officials pay little attention to their persisting symptoms, and that Lyme disease is anything but easy to treat or to cure,\" wrote Michael Specter in a 2013 article in The New Yorker magazine.Complicating the matter is the fact that the same ticks that carry Lyme disease may pass along other harmful bacteria, as well.

Some claim it still makes the best mac and cheese ever, due to its supreme \"meltability.\" Others swear by it for superior grilled cheese sandwiches.I haven\u2019t purchased Velveeta in years, truth be told. But when I saw this recipe for DIY Velveeta on one or our favorite blogs, Brown Eyed Baker, I simply had to give it a try.And darned if these four simple ingredients (shredded cheese, a packet of unflavored gelatin, dry milk, and water) didn\u2019t make a block of smooth orange \"Velveeta.\"In like 3 minutes flat.So OK, you\u2019re not a Velveeta fan. But make this soft-yet-firm, creamy \"cheese mixture\" and I swear you\u2019ll find as many uses for it as there are old-timey dips, sauces, sandwiches, and casseroles out there using Velveeta \u2013 which is plenty.First, line a suitable container with plastic wrap. I used our 9\u2032\u2032 x 4\u2032\u2032 x 4\u2032\u2032 loaf pan, but go ahead and use whatever shape of pan you like.Note: I later discovered this recipe fits perfectly into two plastic wrap-lined 3 1/4\u2032\u2032 x 5 3/4\u2032\u2032 mini loaf pans, the typical foil pans you find at the supermarket. Mini pans yield a more Velveeta-like shape.The preparation couldn\u2019t be simpler. Put 6 tablespoons dry milk (I used our Baker\u2019s Special Dry Milk, which is nonfat) and a 1/4-ounce packet dry unflavored gelatin in a blender or food processor. Blend briefly, just to combine.Add 1 cup boiling water, blending just until smooth. IMMEDIATELY add 16 ounces shredded cheese. I used a couple of 8-ounce bags of shredded orange sharp cheddar cheese. Brown Eyed Baker says to use a mild, freshly grated cheese, but this seemed to work just fine.Process until the mixture is totally smooth.Go ahead, dip your finger in to taste \u2013 that\u2019s the best way to tell.Pour/scoop the mixture into your prepared pan. It starts setting up pretty quickly, so don\u2019t dawdle. Gently pat the plastic wrap onto the surface; the less wrinkled the wrap, the smoother your final product.Refrigerate for a few hours, until it\u2019s set. Take it out of the pan, and make sure it\u2019s wrapped securely \u2013 no bare surfaces showing. Refrigerate until you\u2019re ready for a grilled cheese.Or mac and cheese.Or everyone\u2019s Famous Queso Dip \u2013 which is made with just two ingredients: this cheese, and a can of Ro*Tel Diced Tomatoes and Green Chilies (one 10-ounce can added to a pound of cheese).The recipe, which originally comes from Chef Michael Symon (you know, the guy on Iron Chef), says it\u2019s good for a month in the fridge. I can neither confirm nor deny that \u2013 I used mine up at a party within a week of making it.Yup, I admit it \u2013 I went all the way and made Famous Queso Dip.

(It's all about prioritization!) Plus, we're going to wash everything off -- from the makeup to the sweat -- later anyway, right?But we also know that our baby-faced days are numbered. So we asked Dr. Ava Shamban, Beverly Hills-based dermatologist and author of \"Heal Your Skin,\" and Mally Steves Chakola, founder of M. Steves skincare, just how bad it is to wear makeup while exercising. Can we get a pass with waterproof-mascara? Here are the workout beauty facts you should know and put into practice:Heavy foundations, powders or concealers could contribute to clogged pores.Lighter makeup formulas will also slide right off once you break a sweat, according to Shamban. (Not a cute look when you're on the treadmill next to a hot guy.) \"Eye makeup -- especially mascara, even if it's waterproof -- is a bad idea because it can run and get into your eyes,\" she says. \"And blush is totally unnecessary because your workout will flush your face on its own.\"\"Since your pores open up while sweating, you don\u2019t want to block your skin's ability to breathe by wearing heavy makeup,\" Chakola adds. \"I personally find that mica and micronized formulas can be small enough to enter open pores and can lead to irritation or breakouts.\"It's ideal to remove makeup before beginning a workout by using a cleanser that won\u2019t irritate your skin. Regardless of the form of cleanser, choose a cleanser that is sulfate-free, which won't dry out your skin from frequent washing and is free of synthetic fragrances so you'll avoid skin inflammation.But breaking into a sweat can make it easier to rid the skin of pore-clogging substances.\"What heat and perspiration can do is warm the skin, making the dislodging of pore-clogging substances easier during exfoliation with a cleanser, scrub, washcloth or device like the Clarisonic in the shower after your workout,\" Shamban says. \"It's the same principal that aestheticians use when steaming the skin at the beginning of a facial.\"Don't be afraid to wipe your face with your T-shirt while exercising. It won't hurt your skin.The function of sweat is primarily to cool the body rather than excretion, Shamban explains. The excretion exception is that some medicines and the metabolic aftermath of sulfur-intense foods like garlic get exuded from the pores.\"Perspiration from the eccrine sweat glands is basically just water and is pretty clean. On the other hand, perspiration from apocrine sweat glands in the groin, under the arms and on the feet contains bacteria, which is why it smells,\" she says. \"While we don't like the odor (unless it's from someone we're attracted to sexually), in and of itself, sweat is not bad for the skin. Keeping ourselves odor-free is more a social nicety than a real health issue.\"People often confuse the slick feeling of perspiration with the slick feeling of oily skin. But Shamban assures us that they're not the same thing. \"Working out will make you sweat but it doesn't accelerate oil (sebum) production, which is influenced by genetics and hormones. Workouts don't contribute to breakouts unless it's acne mechanica where there is non-stop rubbing from straps, clothing or equipment.\" In this case, try to avoid touching your face, particularly if you have active breakouts. Use a spot treatment after washing your face with a cleanser containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide.Just think twice before using the towels and shower gel at the gym.Unfortunately, the laundering at most gyms is not regulated like in hospitals. \"The gym towels may look clean, but they are often washed in fragrant detergents and fabric softeners,\" Chakola says. \"While these may make the towel smell clean and look bright, bacteria can live in the fibers of the cloth if the towel isn't replaced frequently or cleaned properly.\"Even if you bring your own towels, the gym environment can transfer bacteria onto your skin, whether you're in a Cobra yoga pose or lifting a set of kettlebells. So after your post-exercise smoothie, Shamban recommends hitting the shower no less than one hour after your workout is done. And don't forget your flip-flops.\"Even in the cleanest establishments, consistently warm, damp environments of gyms, showers and pools (where there is a lot of foot traffic) are breeding grounds for highly contagious viruses like plantar warts or fungi like athlete's foot,\" she says. \"The plantar wart virus can live up to 20 months on surfaces.\"Be kind to your skin. Don't scrub hard or subject it to scalding water. Take a warm shower and use an unscented soap like the Dove Beauty Bar. \"The soaps and cleansers in most gym or public bathrooms are often heavily antibacterial and can really irritate your skin,\" according to Dr. Shamban.If you wash your hair, Chakola suggests washing your face afterward to remove hair product build-up from the skin. And if you're in a rush and you skip washing your hair, try using a dry shampoo to soak up sweat and oils and then pull your hair into a cute topknot to hide oiliness and prevent dirty hair from touching your face.If you use treatment products, Shamban says it is best to wait 10 minutes after bathing and drying your body before applying them in order to give your skin's protective barrier function the chance to reestablish itself. To reduce inflammation on a pimple, place an ice cube directly on it for about 10 seconds on and off repeatedly for about a minute.There are some beauty routines you can keep for the gym.Groom your brows with a spoolie beforehand, pull back your hair into a loose low ponytail and add tinted gloss to your lips to fake looking made-up. \"Also, if your workout clothes are cute and not your brother's old college sweatpants, you'll just feel better about how you look and not have to worry so much about makeup,\" Shamban adds.Moisturizing before workouts isn't really practical, as the lotion is not going to absorb and it can melt and run into your eyes. It can also make your hands slick or make you feel sticky. The exception, of course, is if you're exercising outside, where you'll need a sport-friendly sunscreen.Chakola likes to moisturize immediately after getting out of the shower to lock in moisture. And since no one likes a foundation meltdown, she suggests letting your body cool before applying your makeup.", "answers": {"answer_start": [29], "text": ["Wear Makeup"]}, "id": "400631249615613952"}, {"question": "Photographs Of Cities From Space Have Shown A Worrying Trend", "context": "LED street lamps are good news for the environment, known to provide more light with a greater efficiency, so it\u2019s no surprise much of the world\u2019s cities are switching over to them.In many respects, we shouldn\u2019t be complaining about this.

The average graduate was $28,400 in the red, the report says. In six states, students graduated with an average of more than $30,000 in education debt, and only New Mexico grads came in below the $20K mark, with an average of $18,656 in school debt.New Hampshire, Delaware and Pennsylvania had the highest average student debt loads at $32,795, $32,571 and $32,528, respectively.

The organizers behind California Cannabis Hemp Initiative are collecting signatures, and backers of Marijuana Control, Legalization and Revenue Act are awaiting approval from the state to begin collecting signatures.Other marijuana advocacy groups -- including Newsom's panel -- are working toward a California voter initiative for 2016.\"Voter turnout tends to be much higher in presidential election years,\" Mason Tvert, communications director of the Marijuana Policy Project, told HuffPost. \"We believe a 2016 initiative will best demonstrate just how much support there is for ending marijuana prohibition in California.\"The Drug Policy Alliance echoed this sentiment, saying more education is needed to rally voter support.\"The support for marijuana legalization in California is there,\" Amanda Reiman, policy manager of the Drug Policy Alliance, told HuffPost. \"It just may not be there strongly enough or from the right populations to claim victory in 2014.\"California voters narrowly rejected marijuana legalization in 2010 with Proposition 19. About 53 percent of California voters voted no.Drug Policy Alliance is co-hosting a symposium on legalization in California with the California Society of Addiction Medicine in Denver next week. Reiman said that working with the California Society of Addiction Medicine is part of an effort to win support from California's medical community, which she said is essential to persuade the public. Drug Policy Alliance also is working with environmental and agriculture groups, since much of California marijuana cultivation is outdoors, particularly in the northern counties of Humboldt, Mendocino and Ukiah.California became the first state to legalize medical marijuana when voters passed Proposition 215 in 1996. Since then, the medical cannabis industry has flourished, generating upwards of $100 million in annual tax revenue.\"This is not a matter of 2014 or bust, or 2016 or bust,\" Reiman said. \"Legalization of marijuana in California is going to happen.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [34], "text": ["California"]}, "id": "391347486696042498"}, {"question": "Meet \"The Simpsons\" latest star", "context": "Judd Apatow and \"The Simpsons\" are having a moment.

Ever since that trailer\u2019s release, fans have been inspecting the footage in a bid to discover any clues as to what the game will be actually about.Kojima has certainly been actively feeding into the mystery surrounding the game, making cryptic statements about how the title \"has already begun\" and going to great pains to prevent leaks about it from reaching the press. With that said, it seems there\u2019s one man, aside from Kojima, who knows more about the game than the average person \u2013 and that includes its release date.Icelandic musician Ryan Karazija, one of the members of the band Low Roar that provided the music for the Death Stranding trailer, recently appeared in an interview on the YongYea YouTube channel.

However, the fact that the game already has a release date in mind is a positive sign that Death Stranding isn\u2019t stuck in development hell and that players will be able to play the game sooner rather than later.News of a solid release date will undoubtedly relieve many Kojima fans of the worry that Death Stranding would fall victim to a fate similar to the cancelled Silent Hills game, which was being developed by Kojima and also starred the lead of Death Stranding, actor Norman Reedus. Gamers hopefully won\u2019t have to wait too long to find out when they\u2019ll be able to get their hands on Death Stranding, as Kojima himself said that Death Stranding will be his best work yet.

So the brain is starving, even though the mice are consuming a lot of calories daily. Responsible for this is the protein GLUT-1, which is the most important glucose transporter at the blood-brain barrier.\"Free saturated fatty acids can have a toxic effect on the blood-brain barrier cells and reduce the GLUT-1 transporter.The brain has no way to store glucose and some areas of the brain actually lack glucose and they need to get it immediately from the blood stream.These areas include the cerebral cortex \u2014 which are responsible for learning and memory \u2014 and hypothalamus which controls the metabolism.To compensate for the lack of energy, the brain takes action by using macrophages.Macrophages are particular cells in the immune system and they can produce the growth factor VEGF.This growth factor is part of the system that restores the oxygen supply to tissues and they can increase the production of GLUT-1.The research team was able to measure the glucose levels in mice which were on high-fat diet.They found that the glucose uptake in the brain will still reduce in mice that lack this growth factor.Dr Jais said:\"As a result of this, the mice learn more slowly and have impaired memory.\"When the diet is high in fat the brain is looking for the sugar and to satiate its need will impact the rest of the body.Dr Jais explained:\"We call it the selfish brain, because it gets its glucose by stimulating the body\u2019s appetite for sweet foods and in the long run preventing the uptake in muscles and fat.

For some couples, the question of how often they should have sex might not have come up, which could be a sign they feel sufficiently close and satisfied -- or that they are just too busy or disconnected to think about it.\"Most couples want to be having more sex and I think this is really a result of how busy and full most of our lives are,\" Marin said.Marin avoids prescribing an amount of sex that couples should have, because every couple is different, and instead recommends couples test it out for themselves. \"I'm a big fan of having clients experiment, like, one month try to have sex twice a week and see how that goes, or once a week, try to play around with it,\" Marin said.As for those lucky couples that are content with how often they get busy under the sheets, one study suggests they may not want to change a thing. Researchers asked couples that were having sex about six times a month to double down on getting down. Couples that doubled their sexual frequency were in worse moods and enjoyed sex less at the end of three months than couples who had stuck to their usual level of bedroom activity.\"Being told you should do something always makes it less fun,\" said George Loewenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University and lead author of the study. That is another reason Marin does not make recommendations to couples about sexual frequency -- for fear they could worry they are not living up to expectations and lose their mojo.However, there's a far bigger relationship problem than couples worrying they aren't having quite enough sex -- \"couples that have pretty much stopped having sex,\" Loewenstein said. For these couples, \"I think once a week is a good final goal. ... It is almost like a natural constant to do it once a week,\" he said.Even if these abstinent couples want to be having more sex, they may lack the desire for their partner. These couples can try conventional strategies, such as scheduling more quality time together or trying a change in scenery. \"What couple has not had the experience that you go to a hotel in a new location in a new environment and the person you're with seems different, and different is good when it comes to sex,\" Loewenstein said.But if these tricks aren't enough, couples may have to appeal to their rational rather than lustful side and tell themselves to just do it. \"These couples might be surprised how enjoyable it would be if they restarted,\" Loewenstein said.Should you schedule your sex?It might sound like the least romantic thing in the world to pencil in sexy time with your partner. But if you and your partner are game to try, there is no reason not to make a sex schedule.\"For some couples, scheduling sex works really well, it gives them something to look forward to, they like the anticipation, they like feeling prioritized,\" Marin said. \"Then other couples (say) scheduling sex feels horrible to them, like sex is transactional and just another item on their to-do list.\"Again, Marin recommends couples experiment with scheduling sex to see if it helps them, as long as neither is opposed to it.A good idea for all couples, whether they like the idea of scheduling sex, is to plan for quality time together -- just the two of them. Ideally, this would be about 20 minutes a day with the TV off and cell phones away, but for extra busy couples, it can help to reserve just five minutes a day for a tete-a-tete, Marin said. This time is also the \"container for sex,\" the time and privacy when sex can be initiated, but you don't have to feel pressure about it, she added.Although scheduling sex can help couples that want to be having sex but just can't find the time, it can make things worse for some. \"If there are relationship issues or psychological issues such as stress or anxiety, then scheduling sex might just add to the pressure,\" said Acacia Parks, associate professor of psychology at Hiram College.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.As for when to schedule the sex, the best time is probably the time when you are least likely to be pulled away by life's obligations. One of the perks of rise-and-shine sex is that testosterone levels are highest in the morning, and this hormone drives sexual desire. On the other hand, tuck-you-in sex could help lull you to sleep, as hormones released during orgasm could help you relax and feel tired.According to Muise, the participants in her research typically reported having sex at night before going to sleep, which is not that surprising. But it has to work for both parties. \"This is another point of negotiation between partners,\" Muise said. \"One of them is just too exhausted.

But a new, small study suggests the harmful effects of poor sleep or not enough sleep can be problematic over the long-term as well.The study found older people who don't get enough restful sleep have brain imaging patterns similar to people suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health looked at data from 70 adults with an average age of 76 and reported higher deposits of beta-amyloid in those who didn't sleep much or very well.Beta-amyloid is a protein found in the brain, which tends to form into clusters and eventually into plaque that is the telltale sign of Alzheimer's. Normal sleep-wake patterns actually help regulate levels of beta-amyloid.The participants reported sleeping upwards of 7 hours at the higher end, and no more than 5 hours at the lower end.Since the data was taken from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging, the country's longest running study on aging, researchers say they will need to conduct further trials to know if sleep disturbance necessarily precedes beta-amyloid buildup. The study does open doors to future research studying whether or not bettering a person's sleep can prevent or delay beta-amyloid buildup and Alzheimer's progression.Other studies have also shown a link between lack of sleep and memory. Earlier this year, a study showed older adults can experience memory loss and brain degeneration as a result of sleeplessness, The Huffington Post reported.There have also been various conflicting studies debating whether people really need less sleep as they age.

Apparently the diamond business is experiencing a slow period , because the newest trend for millennials is to marry later in their 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s, and choose more distinctive wedding jewelry that accounts for their concern with money, sustainability, and material.Many young people of today don\u2019t want their engagement and wedding rings to be mass-produced, they want a piece that\u2019s unique to them and also doesn\u2019t cost a fortune. And so, millennials are favoring gemstones, sapphires, and lab-grown diamonds over actual diamonds.

The unemployment rate was just 5.3% in July compared to 7.3% at the end of 2008.The congestion problem isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon either: A report by the U.S. Travel Association found that commuters on many cities highways will soon experience Labor Day-like gridlock \u2014 Labor Day is typically one of the busiest travel days of the year \u2014 on the average day of the week.

That\u2019s 6.9 billion hours for commuters on the whole \u2014 \"more than the time it would take to drive to Pluto and back, if there was a road,\" the authors note.What\u2019s more, in cities with more than one million people, commuters experienced an average of 63 hours of extra travel time each year. And in some cities, that\u2019s even worse. Here are the 10 cities in which residents waste the most hours of their lives sitting in traffic:1. Washington, D.C.Commuters in our nation\u2019s capital spend an average of 82 hours extra a year on the road thanks to traffic gridlock, making this the most congested city in America. This extra drive time costs the average auto commuter $1,834 per year (this number was calculated using a combination of the value of the travel delay \u2014 estimated at $17.67 per hour per person \u2014 and the average cost of gas in the state).2. Los Angeles, Long Beach and AnaheimThe L.A. area comes in a close second when it comes to traffic congestion: Residents there spend an extra 80 hours a year in the car and $1,711 thanks to clogged roadways.3. San Francisco and OaklandAuto commuters in the Bay Area are wasting an extra 78 hours of their year in traffic \u2014 and that\u2019s costing them $1,675. That may make working for some of the more high-profile tech companies (ahem, Facebook and Google) in the area even more appealing, as many provide you with swanky buses to get to and from the office.4. New York and NewarkWhile the New York metro area ranks No. 4 in terms of the extra hours per year spent commuting (74), it ranks No. 2 in terms of what that costs residents ($1739).5. San Jose, Calif.Though it\u2019s not an exceptionally large city, it has outsized traffic congestion: Commuters here waste 67 hours in traffic at a cost of $1,422 per commuter each year. It\u2019s one of only two cities in the top 10 that has fewer than three million residents.6. BostonAs anyone who\u2019s sat (and sat) on I-90 or I-93 knows, it\u2019s slow moving in Boston. Indeed, Bostonians waste 64 hours a year in traffic gridlock at a cost of $1,388.7. SeattleIn rainy Seattle, commuters who travel during peak times are forced to spend an extra $1,491 a year (in extra gas costs and the cost of lost time) thanks to gridlock as well as 63 additional hours in the car.8.

Not the little leap he'll perform automatically in older installments when you run him off a ledge, but a button-specific, bona fide vault.There's a justifiable game-changing reason for this, and it involves serious hang-time in what Nintendo's dubbed The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild . That's the official name for the next-in-series fantasy roamer, due simultaneously on the company's Wii U and forthcoming new game platform (still known solely as \"NX\") next March. I'll explain the game's title in a moment.But first let's talk about climbing. Serious climbing. Rock climbing. Tree climbing. Whatever-you-can-touch-climbing. Approach any perpendicular surface, tap the jump button, and up Link goes. Ruins. Vertiginous towers. Cliff walls. Tree trunks. Escarpments you'd slide down in any other game or need a grappling hook to summit. Altai\u0308r , Spiderman and this guy have nothing on the newfangled version of Nintendo's iconic sword-spinner. It's all part of the creative team's attempt to craft an open-ended world for players to tramp through any way they like in another first for the series.Or maybe a second, if we're counting Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka's 1986 Nintendo Entertainment System free-wandering original. As in that game, you can venture into Breath of the Wild 's more than 100 dungeons (called \"shrines\") in whatever order you like. Just don't expect the enemies lying in wait to be homogenous pushovers. That's part of how Nintendo's regulating progression through the game this time: With great freedom comes the likelihood that you'll wander into a growling goblin's nest.NintendoOn the other hand, Nintendo says it hopes you'll do just that, which is where the subtitle \"Breath of the Wild\" comes in. At a pre-E3 event, the game's producer Eiji Aonuma explained that instead of coming up with a title based on a central story item (ocarinas, swords, caps, hourglasses) or character (Link, Majora, the eponymous twilight princess), the team wanted it to emblematize the world itself. So \"wild\" in the sense that Nintendo wants experimentation and surprise by way of the open, unexplored world design to be \"the soul of the experience.\"That carries through the game's visual style, inspired by a form of water color art called gouache , said Nintendo. It's further informed by an approach to painting known as en plein air , or \"open air,\" where the artist attempts to replicate the moment of an experience (to give that a bit of context, impressionists like Monet and Renoir were proponents of the approach). In practice, it's something like a hybridization of the look in the last few games, as if The Wind Waker 's cel-shading were merged with Twilight Princess 's quasi-realistic style.The world, which I was able to dash and scramble around for roughly 30 minutes, feels as grand as teased in earlier sneak peeks , and the team says wherever you can see you can go \"and beyond.\" In the demo, we were allowed to explore a partly forested area Nintendo said represented just 1% of the total explorable world. Zoom the map out, and that world becomes a sprawl of regions grouped into valleys, jungles, mountains and\u2014Treehouse's Bill Trinen teased this last\u2014possibly even the ocean. All told, Nintendo says Breath of the Wild is 12 times the size of Twilight Princess (itself no slouch in the epic fantasy world Olympics).Jumping and free-roaming are just the start of the game's rethinking of cherished Zelda tropes. Instead of cutting grass to conjure life-replenishing hearts, you hunt for or harvest ingredients consumable raw for minor performance boosts. Combine these in a cooking pan, by contrast, and you can craft edibles with perks in what looks to be an elaborate recipe chasing mini-game.The weather plays a role now, too. Sudden downpours can douse fires, and brandishing a metallic object during a lightning storm may have the sort of jolting repercussions you'd imagine. There's even a temperature gauge you'll need to keep tabs on, donning warmer clothes to survive colder environments and vice versa.NintendoLink's arsenal of axes, clubs and long blades are more transient and break easily, and part of maintaining your arsenal involves stealing new ones from enemies. Enemies no longer roam at random, but occupy colonies and encampments, and they're meant to have a sense of situational purposefulness, says Nintendo. Wait until nighttime (1 minute of realtime = 1 hour of game time) and they'll sleep, making them easier to sneak up on, and sneaking's also a thing: Move quickly and an audio meter bounces erratically to indicate your conspicuousness; crouch, and the meter flattens to let you know you've become sonically invisible.A new and apparently intricate physics framework empowers distinctive tactics. Chop down a hillside tree (yes, Link can chop down trees) and it'll topple, then roll downhill, clearing whatever's in its path (or, if near a crevasse, become a bridge you can clamber across). The same for boulders, which you can shove down inclines to flatten foes. The series' spherical bombs now come in multiple flavors, including one you can ply the environment to roll or push around like a pinball. Hop on Link's shield and he'll surf, Legolas-like, down mountainsides. And there's a paraglider with which Link can soar high above areas, taking in the view to spy hidden items or suss alternate approach paths.What's to stop players from immediately ranging across half the map with impunity? Climb or fly without pause and a circular stamina meter gradually dwindles until Link plummets. I take that to mean there'll be plenty of climbing and flying puzzles, where you'll have to plot approach paths by locating and folding respite points into lengthy climbs or glides. (That, or come up with recipes for stamina-bolstering victuals.)As promised, you can use the Wolf Link amiibo to import that character as a companion who'll stay with Link until defeated (at which point you have to wait 24 hours of real world time to re-import him). Level up Wolf Link's health playing Twilight Princess , and he'll have the same number of hearts playing at Link's side in Breath of the Wild ; import him cold, and he'll be stuck with just three (a clear prod to Wii U fans who've yet to buy that game bundle ). Nintendo's also making two new amiibo, one of Link holding a bow (Archer Link) and another of him on horseback (Rider Link), but the team wasn't ready to say how they'll function in the game.NintendoIt's not clear what Link's up to or who he's ultimately squaring off with in the Zelda-verse this time, but Aonuma confirmed this version of Link has been snoozing for 100 years (he wakes and rises from a tomb-like bed at the game's start). And when someone asked where this Zelda slots in the lore, Aonuma pointed to the t-shirt he came wearing, inscribed with a variation on the Sheikah eye symbol that's appeared in Zelda games since Ocarina of Time . Make of that what you will, said Aonuma with a sly smile.Towards the end of my demo, in the belly of a rune-scrawled shrine, I got my hands on one of the game's most intriguing new items: A magnet that lets you seize and then wing large objects around. All I managed to do before the demo ended was to yank a panel off the floor (unearthing a passage) and levitate a large block (to clear my route, but it also looked like I might be able to lob it at enemies). But my sense was that it'll be a central part of this philosophical shift to a \"single puzzle, multiple solutions\" motif.Important questions remain, the most obvious being how players are going to be able to have the same experience on the Wii U and NX versions\u2014a point confirmed by Aonuma during the presentation\u2014if the NX is truly something \"unique and different.\" We'll know soon enough, when the company unveils the Wii U's successor later this year.", "answers": {"answer_start": [186], "text": ["jump"]}, "id": "800048986762423_817571348343520"}, {"question": "Katie Ledecky could shatter an unbreakable barrier at the Olympics", "context": "Katie Ledecky developed the \"gallop\" in her stroke with former coach Yuri Suguiyama.

If she wins gold, Ledecky will join Debbie Meyer (1968) as just the second female in Olympics history to win three individual freestyle gold medals in the same Games. But Ledecky could do something even more extraordinary: break the eight-minute mark, a feat that, up until this point, has been seen only in the men\u2019s competition.It\u2019s not as crazy as it sounds. Ledecky has lowered the world record in the 800-meter freestyle by more than seven seconds in 29 months to its current 8:06.68. Before that, it took 26 years to lower the record by the same amount.According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Benjamin Morris, Ledecky \"is pretty much the Secretariat of swimming\" whose \"performance in the 800 freestyle is the most any swimmer has dominated any distance.\"Ledecky already set a world record in the 400 freestyle earlier in the Games with a sizzling time of 3:56.46, making her the second woman (Italy\u2019s Federica Pellegrini was the first in 2009) to swim the 400 freestyle in less than four minutes. It\u2019s also the the 12th world record Ledecky has set since the 2012 London Olympics. Extrapolating her 400 freestyle gold-medal winning time in Rio, Ledecky would swim the 800 freestyle in 7:52.92. And while it is unreasonable to think Ledecky can maintain her 400-meter pace for twice the distance, that seven-second cushion could be enough to get her under eight minutes.Since 1968, there have been 10 women to compete in the 200, 400 and 800 freestyle events. The average finalist swam at a pace 14 seconds slower than their 400-meter time, and two \u2014 Irina Aksyonova (1980) and Keena Rothhammer (1972) \u2014 were within 10 seconds of their projected 800-meter time based on their actual 400-meter finishes.

But they aren\u2019t the only company stinging from the collapse of a proposed $45 billion buyout of Time Warner Cable.A number of Wall Street banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase, lost out big with the Thursday\u2019s news that Comcast is throwing in the towel on it\u2019s 14-month pursuit of Time Warner Cable. The deal unravelled just hours after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recommended that the proposed merger be reviewed by a federal judged over antitrust concerns.For Comcast, the nation\u2019s largest cable provider, it means missing out on the chance to gobble up its number two competitor and thoroughly dominate cable and high-speed Internet access across the United States. But for 14 different Wall Street banks, it means losing out on nearly $400 million they stood to gain from what the Wall Street Journal described as one of the \"biggest deal-related paydays in years.\"According to WSJ, advisory fees alone were set to surpass $320 million, with an additional $60 million in other fees. That would have set a record exceeding the roughly $270 million Wall Street made in 2001 from Comcast\u2019s purchase of AT&T\u2019s broadband service.Part of what drove the cost of the deal so high were the \"multiple, interlocking transactions\" that sprang up around the proposed deal, WSJ reporter Liz Hoffman writes. Contingent on Comcast purchasing Time Warner Cable were two separate deals involving Charter Communications, a company that had previously attempted to purchase Time Warner.If the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal had gone through, Charter was set to purchase Bright House Networks LLC, a smaller cable and Internet provider. It also would have purchased a portion of Comcast\u2019s subscribers that were to be sold off in an effort to ease monopoly concerns. These two deals were valued at $30 billion and also stood to generate tens of millions of dollars in fees on their own.Of all the banks associated with this massive, multi-faceted deal, Chase had the most to gain, roughly $25 million.

The New York Times has more:In recent years, scientists have debated based on mixed evidence whether a father's age is linked to his child's vulnerability to individual disorders like autism and schizophrenia. Some studies have found strong associations, while others have found weak associations or none at all.The new report, which looked at many mental disorders in Sweden, should inflame the debate, if not settle it, experts said. Men have a biological clock of sorts because of random mutations in sperm over time, the report suggests, and the risks associated with later fatherhood may be higher than previously thought. The findings were published on Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry.\"This is the best paper I've seen on this topic, and it suggests several lines of inquiry into mental illness,\" said Dr. Patrick F. Sullivan, a professor of genetics at the University of North Carolina, who was not involved in the research. \"But the last thing people should do is read this and say, 'Oh no, I had a kid at 43, the kid's doomed.' The vast majority of kids born to older dads will be just fine.\"Dr. Kenneth S. Kendler, a professor of psychiatry and human molecular genetics at Virginia Commonwealth University, also urged caution in interpreting the results. \"This is great work from a scientific perspective,\" he said. \"But it needs to be replicated, and biomedical science needs to get in gear and figure out what accounts for\" the mixed findings of previous studies.The strengths of the new report are size and rigor. The research team, led by Brian M. D'Onofrio of Indiana University, analyzed medical and public records of some 2.6 million people born in Sweden from 1973 to 2001. Like many European countries, Sweden has centralized medical care and keeps detailed records, so the scientists knew the father's age for each birth and were able to track each child's medical history over time, as well as that of siblings and other relatives. Among other things, the analysis compared the mental health of siblings born to the same father and found a clear pattern of increased risk with increasing paternal age.Compared with the children of young fathers, aged 20 to 24, those born to men age 45 and older had about twice the risk of developing psychosis, the signature symptom of schizophrenia; more than three times the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of autism; and about 13 times the chance of having a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder. Children born to older fathers also tended to struggle more with academics and substance abuse.The researchers controlled for every factor they could think of, including parents' education and income. Older couples tend to be more stable and have more income \u2014 both protective factors that help to temper mental problems \u2014 and this was the case in the study.

Here's a guide to what your hue says about you.Few people get worked up over the occasional bruise. We know from experience that a purplish spot isn't usually cause for alarm and, in time, will clear up on its own -- a classic case of the wait-and-see approach making sound medical sense. But other discolorations that may appear harmless can serve as warning signals for serious diseases, like diabetes, skin cancer, and autoimmune disorders. The sooner you pick up on the clues, the faster you can take the right steps to getting and staying healthier.RedTonguePay attention to the color of your tongue. If it becomes a bright, beefy red (the change can be subtle, but it will be noticeable), you may be low on vitamin B12. This vitamin is essential for making the red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout your body and plays a vital role in maintaining brain function. While researchers aren't sure why a B12 deficiency affects the tongue, you may develop neurological problems, including dementia, if your levels stay low for too long.Protect Yourself: Meat and dairy products are rich in B12, so if you're a vegetarian or vegan, you may have a harder time reaching your daily allowance. Make sure to take a multivitamin, and consider eating fortified cereals for breakfast (some offer 100 percent of your recommended daily value of B12 in one serving).WhiteSkinWhen pigment-producing skin cells die, you're left with white spots that retain the same texture as the rest of your skin but lack melanin. This condition, known as vitiligo, affects up to two million Americans, the majority of cases occurring in people under 40. It's most noticeable where skin is usually a bit darker -- hands, feet, arms, face, lips. But it can also occur in the armpits, nostrils, and even on your scalp. Researchers think vitiligo may be the result of an autoimmune disease that causes your body to mistakenly attack its own cells; it's associated with thyroid disease and Addison's disease (in which your adrenal glands stop producing enough of the hormones that help control everything from your immune response to your sex drive).Protect Yourself: While there's currently no way to prevent most autoimmune diseases, you may be able to treat your white patches with corticosteroid creams, which have been shown to be effective in restoring some pigmentation. And I can't stress how important it is to wear sunscreen. Without melanin, your skin is at much higher risk for sunburns. To conceal the spots while shielding your skin, opt for a tinted moisturizer with at least SPF 30.YellowElbows, knees, hands and feetThe appearance of soft, yellowish bumps (called xanthomas) on your body -- particularly on your elbows, knees, hands, and feet -- can indicate dangerously high cholesterol levels, which increase your risk for cardiovascular problems including heart disease and stroke. These growths, which are painless and can range from very small to wider than three inches, are actually fat deposits that build up under the skin, often when an excess amount of lipids -- due to either a genetic condition or a high-fat diet -- accumulates in your blood.Protect Yourself: Nearly 54 million women have high or borderline-high cholesterol, with 19 million falling in the high range. But while maintaining a healthy diet can certainly help keep cholesterol under control, when it comes to lowering your levels of LDL (the bad kind), exercise is critical. A 2009 study in the Journal of Lipid Research found that women who walked one extra hour or jogged an additional 30 minutes per week lowered their LDL levels by 3 percent or more. They also saw an increase in their levels of HDL (the good kind). Even better news: Once cholesterol is back in a healthy range, xanthomas may start to clear up.BlackNeck, armpits and groinDark, velvety patches found in your armpits and on your neck and groin are likely acanthosis nigricans. This slow-developing skin condition, which is more common in overweight and obese adults, can be a sign of type 2 diabetes. Researchers believe that insulin resistance (which causes high blood sugar and can lead to type 2 diabetes) can send some skin cells into overdrive, increasing skin thickness and darkening pigment.Protect Yourself: To help prevent diabetes, pay particular attention to your diet. Filling up on high-fiber foods (think oatmeal, beans, and broccoli) can slow the body's absorption of sugar and, as a result, may keep blood sugar within a healthy range. One study found that prediabetics who consumed the most fiber were 62 percent less likely to develop full-blown diabetes than those who consumed the least.BrownNailsThe next time you do your monthly body check for new moles or dark spots, be sure to examine your nails. Dark, vertical bands (they're typically brown but can also appear blue or black) under your nail beds -- most commonly on your thumb or big toe -- could be a type of melanoma. While melanoma accounts for less than 5 percent of skin cancers in the United States, it's responsible for 75 percent of skin cancer deaths because it often goes undetected. And your risk is greatly affected by the color of your skin: Among Caucasians, only 2 to 3 percent of melanomas are found under the nail, but that number is as high as 40 percent among the rest of the population. Malignant melanomas can be easily treated if caught early, so make an appointment with a dermatologist if you notice any dark bands on your nails. She'll do a biopsy if she suspects cancer.Protect Yourself: As with all skin cancers, prevention is key. When you apply sunscreen in the morning, take the time to coat your nails and cuticles. Maintaining strong nails can also help shield the skin beneath, so keep them well moisturized to prevent cracking and flaking. And if you use nail polish, keep in mind that some brands now offer added UV protection.", "answers": {"answer_start": [677], "text": ["bright, beefy red"]}, "id": "381074790166982656"}, {"question": "There is only one way to deal with Donald Sterling", "context": "Suspending Donald Sterling is not enough. Newsflash: it isn't going to happen, either.In case you're not familiar with Sterling, he's the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, a National Basketball Association organization whose roster and coaching staff is almost entirely African American. Oh, he's also the guy who was allegedly recorded telling his girlfriend not to post pictures on her Instagram of African Americans and not to \"bring them to the game.\"As this story unfolds in the media, chances are you're going to hear people refer back to these comments, get quotes from Magic Johnson (who appeared in the Instagram photo), revere the furious Michael Jordan, and hopefully bash Sterling for being a bigoted hypocrite.But before we become engrossed in our own rage and spend the next week crucifying this man, it is important to stop and consider the value in this moment: We have been let into the mentality of true, American racism. Let's learn from him and make the most out of this moment to do battle with the people that share his prejudices.Sterling's comments about not bringing African Americans to the game will be repeated the most, but they may be the least frightening.

Blacks feel certain things towards other groups. It's been that way historically and it will always be that way.\"As a fellow Jew, I'm embarrassed and ashamed that Sterling doesn't understand, vilify and denounce any form of denigration or racism. These comments reflect three major beliefs of today's racists in America: 1) Non-white people have an obligation to suppress their heritage; 2) Social divides created by skin color and ethnicities have always been that way and will always be that way; 3) A white man somehow has a better understanding of how minorities feel towards each other than the actual minorities he's discussing (i.e., his \"girlfriend\").I also won't ignore the fact that Sterling allegedly used to bring women into the locker room showers after games, putting his players on display to show off \"their beautiful black bodies.\" I won't avert my eyes from his 2.73 million dollar settlement for charges of discriminatory renting practices against Hispanics, blacks and families with children in 2005, either.It is clear now, if it wasn't entirely clear before, that Donald Sterling is a bigoted man, one that does not understand or appreciate the tremendous influence of a diverse culture in our country.

Perhaps far older than the invention of computers or even the invention of binary math in the West. The residents of a tiny Polynesian island may have been doing calculations in binary\u2014a number system with only two digits\u2014centuries before it was described by Gottfried Leibniz, the co-inventor of calculus, in 1703.If you\u2019re reading this article, you are almost certainly a user of the decimal system. That system is also known as base-10 because of its repeating pattern of 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 is followed by 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and so forth. But the decimal system is not the only counting system available. The Babylonians used base-60. The Mayas used base-20. Some Australian aboriginal groups may have used base-5. And of course, today most counting and calculation is done by computers not in decimal but binary, the base-2 system of zeros and ones.Each system has subtle advantages depending on what sort of counting and calculations are needed. The decimal system is handy considering that people have 10 fingers. But when it comes to division, other systems are better. Because 10 has only two prime factors (2 and 5), dividing by thirds results in an annoyingly infinite approximation (0.3333 ... ) whereas the base-12 counting system produces a nice finite solution. (Indeed, some mathematicians have advocated for a worldwide switch to base-12.) Binary, meanwhile, has a leg up on decimal when it comes to calculation, as Leibniz discovered 300 years ago. For example, although numbers in binary become much longer, multiplying them is easier because the only basic facts one must remember are 1 x 1 = 1 and 0 x 0= 1 x 0 = 0 x 1 = 0.But Leibniz may have been scooped centuries earlier by the people of Mangareva, a tiny island in French Polynesia about 5000 kilometers south of Hawaii. While studying their language and culture, Andrea Bender and Sieghard Beller, anthropologists at the University of Bergen in Norway, were astonished to find a mathematical system that seems to mix base-10 and base-2. \"I was so thrilled that I couldn't sleep that night,\" Bender says. It could be not only the first new indigenous arithmetic system discovered in decades, but also the first known example of binary arithmetic developed outside Eurasia.Like all Polynesians, the people who first settled on Mangareva more than 1000 years ago had a decimal counting system. But, according to Bender and Beller, the islanders added a binary twist over the ensuing centuries. Just like English has a few special words like a dozen for 12 and a score for 20, the Mangarevan language has special words for large groups. But their special counting words are all decimal numbers multiplied by powers of two, which are 1, 2, 4, 8 ... . Specifically, takau equals 10; paua equals 20; tataua, 40; and varu, 80. Those big numbers are useful for keeping track of collections of valuable items, such as coconuts, that come in large numbers. Bender and Beller realized that the Mangarevan counting system makes it possible to use binary arithmetic for calculations of large numbers, they report today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in a paper that even nonexperts will enjoy reading.But here\u2019s the catch. Even if the native mathematical system of Mangareva employed binary arithmetic, the current residents of the island no longer use that system. Two centuries of contact with the West has resulted in a complete switch to decimal calculation. Even the Mangarevan language itself is now threatened with extinction. Bender and Beller are relying on their analysis of the language and an account of the traditional counting words written by ethnographers in 1938. They acknowledge that it is impossible to prove exactly when Mangareva developed the system, but the entrenchment of the number terms in the language suggests a far-reaching origin. Unfortunately, the anthropologists may have made their discovery just one generation too late to see Mangarevan math in action.\"The hypothesis advanced by the authors is indeed plausible,\" says Rafael Nu\u0301n\u0303ez, an anthropologist at the University of California, San Diego, \"but the absence of original Mangarevan written records constitutes a real challenge.\" However, Nu\u0301n\u0303ez notes that ironically, \"it is the absence of written practices in this culture that makes the hypothesis plausible.\" Keeping track of all those calculations in their heads would have been so much easier with the binary math built into the Mangarevan language, he says.", "answers": {"answer_start": [137], "text": ["The residents of a tiny Polynesian island"]}, "id": "413148593025847296"}, {"question": "You won't believe where the next 'Battlefield' game is going", "context": "The next Battlefield will be known as Battlefield 1 .

Like its bigger and older siblings, the Jambox (also $179) and Big Jambox ($299), Mini Jambox is a rectangular speaker that connects to any device that has Bluetooth. Phones, tablets, music players or computers with Bluetooth can wirelessly send audio to the speaker, while devices without Bluetooth can connect to a 3.5 mm jack that allows for wired playback.At six inches long, one inch wide and just over two inches tall, the Mini Jambox is about half the width of the Jambox, which is already a pretty small speaker. To put that in perspective: it's about the size of a pencil case, weighs as much as two smartphones, and easily fits into a small purse or the pocket of a pair of pants.The idea behind the Mini Jambox was to design a speaker that, like a phone or tablet, can be carried with you at all times, Travis Bogard, vice president of product management at Jawbone, said in an interview last week.\"It's not rocket science to make a small speaker loud,\" said Bogard. \"That's easy. [But] how do you make great sound in something small?\"He added: \"How can we make something that's as accessible as the iPod, iPhone or iPad that you have with you at all times?\"The Mini Jambox is made for those moments -- at a park, at an impromptu gathering with a few friends, when you're showing someone a viral video -- when your phone or tablet's internal speaker isn't going to cut it. It's meant to be truly portable, and it's not designed to replace your home stereo.Pairing the Mini Jambox with my devices was easy. Simply turn it on and and hold down the \"pairing button\" on the side of the speaker until you hear a voice that says \"Mini Jambox is in pairing mode -- waiting to pair with your device.\" Then, go to the Bluetooth settings in your phone, tablet or computer and select Mini Jambox. A voice alerts you seconds later when pairing is successful.I moved apartments over Labor Day weekend, so I spent hours listening to the Mini Jambox as I packed and unpacked boxes. I streamed Spotify, Pandora, NPR and Netflix from an iPhone, Moto X, and my computer, and the sound was, for the most part, very impressive. Despite its size, Mini Jambox was loud enough to be heard throughout my apartment. When listening to it outside one evening, I had to turn it down to make sure I wouldn't disturb the neighbors. I would only occasionally hear distortion, when I was listening to music at the highest volume. The bass isn't what you'd get with a larger speaker, but for a wireless speaker that you can carry in your pocket, it sounds pretty darn good.Jawbone is a company that prides itself on industrial design, and the Mini Jambox, constructed from a solid brick of aluminum that's been chiseled away, is an attractive piece of hardware. And I inadvertently found out that it's durable; the Mini Jambox sounded as good as ever after surviving a 4-foot fall onto concrete, suffering only a slightly dented corner.I never had to worry about the battery, which gives you 10 hours of playback on a single charge; Jawbone says that the Mini Jambox can be in standby mode for up to 75 hours.The Mini Jambox also has a speakerphone, so if it's paired with a phone and it rings, you can answer without disconnecting the Bluetooth. (When someone calls, the audio stops and a voice reads out the phone number that's calling, which isn't actually that helpful because many of us no longer have phone numbers committed to memory.) But I wasn't overly impressed with the way the speakerphone sounded -- and neither were the people on the other end -- so I would switch to the handset when someone called.The biggest negative of the Mini Jambox, however, is the steep price tag. At $179, it's more expensive than some of the devices that stream music to it. You're paying a premium for a beautifully designed portable speaker that's also a fashion statement. But at the same time, it's a lot to spend on a speaker that's not meant to replace your home sound system.The Mini Jambox comes in nine anodized colors and goes on sale online on Wednesday. Jawbone hasn't said when the speaker will begin to ship, but it will be available at a handful of retailers later this month.", "answers": {"answer_start": [97], "text": ["Mini Jambox"]}, "id": "375305503632404481"}, {"question": "You won\u2019t believe what \u201890s hair trend \"Game of Thrones\" is bringing back", "context": "You won\u2019t believe what \u201890s hair trend \"Game of Thrones\" is bringing backYou won\u2019t believe what \u201890s hair trend \"Game of Thrones\" is bringing back MoreDramatic curls are making a huge comeback, thanks to the ever-sexy Jon Snow.

This kind of perm isn\u2019t going to be a repeat of Justin Timberlake\u2019s curls from the early 2000s that looked rock hard from all the styling gel. Technology has improved, according to Diana Schmidtke, a professional men\u2019s stylist with loads of experience. She told USA Today, \"It\u2019s not your 1980s perms anymore, the science has technically advanced.\"Gone are the days when a perm left you with tight, stiff curls. \"Now they\u2019re using very large perm rods, which give looser curls,\" Schmidtke said. Your hair will have more movement, giving it a more natural, face-framing look, rather than the over-the-top volume we used to see back in the day. So far, sounds pretty sexy. Of course, if you go to a trusted stylist, they\u2019ll work with you to find out how to make the perm fit your face perfectly.It\u2019s important to note, though, that Kit Harington, the actor responsible for bringing Jon Snow to life, has naturally curly hair. No perm needed. Schmidtke said, \"It should be duly noted that Kit Harington\u2019s hair is naturally curly. In photoshoots or on the red carpet you see they actually relax his hair.\" So Kit isn\u2019t exactly trying to set any trends here. He\u2019s actually been quite outspoken about how he isn\u2019t fond of being a sex object of sorts. \"I like to think of myself as more than a head of hair or a set of looks,\" he once said.I have to say, I think it\u2019s pretty cool that men are feeling more and more comfortable to express themselves in this way. We used to think of perms as beauty routines reserved specifically for women, so it\u2019s great to see everyone comfortable enough to ask for a perm if they feel like it. Besides, curls are sexy! And they\u2019ve been considered sexy ever since the 19th century, when Romantic poets flaunted their wavy hair as they produced heart wrenching works about true love. So in a way, Jon Snow is bringing romance back in a modern way.Whether the perm fad actually picks up doesn\u2019t matter to me, as long as Jon Snow keeps his locks \u2014 and all his other traits \u2014 exactly the way they are.The post You won\u2019t believe what \u201890s hair trend \"Game of Thrones\" is bringing back appeared first on HelloGiggles.", "answers": {"answer_start": [366], "text": ["man perms"]}, "id": "4m18qx"}, {"question": "Here\u2019s Fallout 4 Far Harbor DLC Size Compared to the Commonwealth World Map", "context": "Here\u2019s Fallout 4 Far Harbor DLC Size Compared to the Commonwealth World MapThe third Fallout 4 DLC, Far Harbor was released yesterday and as promised it offers a massive new landmass.

The average adult is 24 pounds heavier today than in 1960. Our growing girth adds some US$200 billion per year to our health care expenditure, amounting to a severe health crisis.Drug research has not yielded a pill that helps people lose weight and keep it off. Traditional approaches such as diet and exercise can work short-term, but people almost inevitably regain the weight. Randomized controlled trials of weight loss surgery have shown some improvements in diabetes but not in mortality, cancer and cardiovascular disease.If there is ever to be a \"pill\" \u2013 a solution to weight \u2013 it will be changing the brain, particularly the primitive areas of the brain, the \"emotional brain\" or mammalian and reptilian brain. These areas house circuits that control stress and our stress-fueled emotions, thoughts and behaviors. These circuits can be rewired in humans so by changing them, we have a chance to address the root cause of stress-related problems, including obesity. While some overweight and obesity are caused by genetic make-up, more and more research is indicating that stress plays a big role in weight gain. Many people under stress turn to food for comfort.My colleagues and I set out to develop a neuroscience-based approach to weight management and dealing with the common excesses we all face, through emotional brain training. The idea was to use neuroscience-based tools to change the brain so that the whole range of common excesses would fade. The method has shown promising results.The emotional brain is command central for weight and common excesses. It includes the fear, reward and starvation centers. When that brain is in stress, all three centers promote overeating and weight gain. We have strong drives to do exactly what we know we shouldn\u2019t do. We can\u2019t help it! Our emotional brain is in stress.That stress ramps up the reward value of food, increases hunger for carbohydrates and decreases metabolic rate, almost ensuring weight gain. The stress-obesity link has been well-documented. Our thinking brain (neocortex) goes off line, and the extremes of our emotional brain calls the shots.To Take Care Of Your Body, Take Care Of Your BrainLevels of stress. via www.shutterstock.comThe first step in taking control of our weight is to destress the emotional brain. In emotional brain training (EBT), we release stress by checking in several times throughout the day, identifying our level of stress and using the technique for that stress level to \"spiral up\" to a state of well-being.There are five levels of stress and five tools. To get an idea of how they work, take a few breaths, check in with yourself and identify your stress level. Then use the tools for that level of stress to reduce your stress rapidly.1. Compassion Tool (Stress Level 1 - Very Low Stress) Say to yourself, \"Feel compassion for myself,\" then wait for a wave of compassion to flow through your body. Next say, \"Feel compassion for others,\" and feel a slight wave of warmth. Last, say, \"Feel compassion for all living beings.\"2. Feelings Tool (Stress Level 2 - Low Stress) Ask yourself, \"How do I feel?\" Often, three feelings bubble up, but wait long enough so that one feeling is the strongest. That\u2019s the one! Next ask yourself, \"What do I need?\" and, finally, \"Do I need support?\"3. Flow Tool (Stress Level 3 - A Little Stress) Say the words: \"I feel angry that ...\" and watch what words arrive in your mind to complete the sentence. State the sentence again, for seven more feelings: sad, afraid, guilty, grateful, happy, secure and proud. Notice the glow in your body and how your stress is gone. Why? When we feel our negative feelings, they fade. We are no longer in peril and the brain naturally focuses on positive feelings that give us the energy to move forward and do good things in our life.4. Cycle Tool (Stress Level 4 - High Stress) Start by stating what is bothering you (don\u2019t hold back!), then protest that stress by saying \"I feel angry that ... I can\u2019t stand it that ... I hate it that ... .\" and each time watch what words arrive in your mind. This can unlock the circuit so that you can change at a deeper level. Pause and take a few deep breaths, then say the words: \"I feel sad that ... I feel afraid that ... I feel guilty that ...\" and watch what words arrive in your mind to complete each sentence.Next support yourself, and say, \"OF COURSE I could do that (such as overeat) because my unreasonable expectation is ... \" and again wait for words to bubble up from your unconscious mind, such as: \"I get my safety from overeating.\" That\u2019s just an old glitch of a memory that needs updating. So, update it! Say the opposite expectation (such as \"I cannot get my safety from food ... I can get my safety from connecting to myself\"). As you stated this when the circuit was freshly unlocked, the circuit can change into the expectation of your choosing. As the new expectation becomes dominant, the emotional drives for various excesses (including food) can begin to fade so that changing behavior becomes easier.5. Damage Control Tool (Stress Level 5 - Very High Stress) When we\u2019re that stressed, we need to be held and comforted. Sometimes just rocking in your chair or breathing deeply helps. Also, you can say calming words repeatedly: \"Do not judge. Minimize harm. Know it will pass. After all, it\u2019s just stress and it will fade.\"Survival Circuits Activate Strong Emotional Drives To OvereatOnce you\u2019ve started releasing stress from your emotional brain, chances are you\u2019ll notice that you still get triggered sometimes. You might even blame yourself for that late night binge or that mindless eating. Actually, it\u2019s just a survival circuit.They are encoded when we are stressed and reach for food to cope. The brain remembers that food \"saved us\" from stress, so it encodes an expectation, such as \"I get my safety from food.\" That circuit can be replayed for a lifetime, fueling maladaptive eating.Research now shows that these survival circuits can be rewired and we do that in EBT. In fact, they can only be rewired when we are stressed. Only then does the circuit unlock and make change more lasting. When stressed and craving food, the EBT user reaches for a tool rather than for the food and uses it to stop the craving and change the circuit. The drive to overeat fades.The Last Step: Keeping The Weight OffKeeping weight off is hard but it may be easier if we improve the brain\u2019s emotional setpoint. Often a setpoint in stress is encoded from adverse experiences early in life and causes chronic stress overload in the emotional brain, a set up for weight regain.The solution is to move up the emotional setpoint, so we get the emotional brain out of chronic stress, which is why the EBT program is aimed at raising the setpoint, so participants are more resilient to new stresses, less likely to regain the weight they have lost and, most of all, to experience more joy in their daily lives.Laurel Mellin, Associate Clinical Professor of Family & Community Medicine and Pediatrics, University of California, San FranciscoThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

Jerry Brown, California would become the first state in the nation to ban the use of \"Redskins\" as a team name or mascot in public schools, according to the Washington, D.C.-based National Congress of American Indians, founded in 1944. Many Native Americans consider the term a racial slur.The bill is the latest effort in a more than 50-year national campaign by Native Americans to remove race-based team names from schools and sports groups. In California, proponents of the ban have cited peer-reviewed studies by researchers at the University of Arizona, Stanford University and the University of Michigan that found American Indian youth who were exposed to Native American mascots and stereotypical imagery reported a diminished sense of what they could achieve academically.Cindy La Marr, executive director of the Sacramento-based nonprofit organization Capitol Area Indian Resources, said the harm of stereotypical racial mascots is compounded because there is a widespread lack of knowledge about the modern-day lives of Native Americans or their history. That history, documented by the California Research Bureau in a 2002 report, includes state-funded military expeditions against the Indians in the 1850s and an 1850 law allowing a white person to obtain Indian children for indenture.\"It\u2019s time that we as a state take a stand against racial slurs used in our public schools,\" said state Assemblyman Luis Alejo, D-Salinas, author of Assembly Bill 30, known as the California Racial Mascots Act.The bill unanimously passed the Assembly Education Committee last month and is heading for a hearing before the Assembly Committee on Arts, Entertainment, Sports, Tourism and Internet Media on April 21.Just four California schools continue to use \"Redskins\" as a team name and mascot: Calaveras High School in Calaveras County, Chowchilla Union High School in Madera County, Gustine High School in Merced County and Tulare Union High School in Tulare County.\"We love our mascot,\" said Ron Seals, superintendent of Chowchilla Union High School District. The school mascot is an Indian chief known as \"Reddy Redskin,\" he said.\"I\u2019m not disputing the fact that it\u2019s offensive to some, but I\u2019m not calling you a Redskin,\" he said. \"We call ourselves Redskins.\"\"The name and the mascot have been a source of pride at the high school for 60 or 70 years,\" said Joseph Oliveira Jr., a former first baseman for the Gustine High baseball team and a member of the Gustine City Council, which officially opposes the effort to remove the name. \"It\u2019s never been thought of as being a slur. We are the Redskins. We are the mighty Redskins. The town loves the nickname and to lose it now will be devastating.\"Dahkota Kicking Bear Brown, 16, a Miwok Indian and a junior at Argonaut High School in Jackson, told a different story at a hearing before the Assembly Education Committee.As a sophomore lineman for the Argonaut football team, Brown said he dreaded game day against the Calaveras High School \"Redskins\" because it included war cries from fans, sports announcers announcing \"a wild party of Redskins!\" and even his own friends shouting \"Kill the Redskins! Send them on the Trail of Tears!\" He recalled his cousin crying after a football game during which a female student dressed up as \"Pocahottie\" while other students pretended to prepare to burn her at the stake.\"I do not blame those students, the school or staff for any of these things,\" Brown said in an email interview. \"I do not think they knew better or considered what they were doing as wrong.\" But, he said, \"I will blame people for hearing the facts and then not caring enough to stop the harm.\"The California Racial Mascots Act would require California schools to phase out \"Redskins\" as a team name and mascot by Jan. 1, 2019.

While washing the dishes or taking a shower, she practices mindfulness, describing how the soap smells and feels, and what the splashing water sounds like. In the grocery store, she talks about the foods she sees and sniffs.\"Sometimes, people look at you like you're a crazy person when you're like, 'I'm feeeeeeling this pepper. It's red. It's waxy,'\" laughed the 33-year-old school counselor, who lives in Miami with her husband and their 1-year-old daughter.But the exercises, which Fisch's therapist recommended, are beginning to provide relief from the anxiety she has battled for the better part of a decade -- staying up nights, fretting: How am I going to go to work for nine hours and take care of the baby? When am I going to have time to go to the grocery store? Increasingly, through her daily practice of meditation, Fisch is able to exert some control over those thoughts, recognizing them when they arise, and calmly telling them to go away.\"It's not the traditional idea of meditation of, I'm sitting cross-legged on the floor, I clear my mind and I'm saying 'Om' for 20 minutes,\" Fisch said. \"When you work full-time, and you have a kid, you're like, 'Seriously? I don't even have 20 minutes to work out. And I'm supposed to clear my mind?'\"Whitney Fisch says mindfulness has helped her deal with her anxiety and connect with her daughter.Women are increasingly asking similar versions of those questions, as the ancient practice of meditation becomes more and more mainstream. The possibility that something so seemingly simple could help slash stress and affect broader markers of health is a tantalizing one, particularly at a time when 68 percent of women in the United States say that managing their stress is very important to them, but only 34 percent feel they're succeeding. Still, it's one thing to acknowledge meditation's benefits, and another to make time for it on a daily basis amid the demands of work and family life. And so more women are asking how and when exactly this is supposed to happen.\"I think a lot of women have no idea where to begin,\" admitted Gabrielle Bernstein, author of May Cause Miracles, a guidebook offering small changes women can make day-to-day to promote happiness. \"I think with something as simple as Googling 'guided meditation' you can get yourself there, or Googling 'how to meditate.'\"Indeed, while more formal, group study has benefits, it's not necessary, echoed Sharon Salzberg, cofounder of the Insight Meditation Society and author of Real Happiness, The Power of Meditation: A 28-Day Program. Women can turn to meditation books, tapes, classes, friends -- or any combination thereof that they feel connected or drawn to, she said.As more people begin to consider meditation as a way to bring balance and calm to their lives, Salzberg says the most important thing is to approach it not as something intimidating and exotic, but as an accessible, flexible practice that can fit into even the busiest life.\"People tend to have such a strong tendency to punish themselves, and think, 'Oh, I'm not doing this right, because I'm not sitting here in bliss every single moment' ... or 'I failed at this, because I couldn't stop any thinking from happening.' It's those unrealistic expectations that really thwart us.\"One of the strongest arguments for meditation is that it doesn't need to be time-consuming. Bernstein, for example, believes just 60 seconds of focused stillness a day can produce profound changes in women's lives -- breathing in for five seconds, holding their breath for five seconds, and exhaling for five seconds. Salzberg recommends beginners meditate three times a week for five to 15 minutes, and work up to 20 minutes daily if possible, but she believes that what matters most is consistency.That's a lesson Jillian Amodio, 23, a prolific freelance writer and stay-at-home mother with a 2-year-old daughter, took some time to learn. At 19, she was diagnosed with endometriosis -- a painful condition that occurs when the tissue that lines a woman's uterus grows elsewhere in her body. Amodio went so far as to have menopause temporarily induced, which relieved her pain for more than a year before it returned. She then began researching \"alternative healing\" and took up a home yoga and meditation routine, piecing together elements from different videos and DVDs. (HuffPost is not advocating this approach, it is what Amodio tried.) Though she believes the practice has all but eliminated her pain, it took her several months to fight the sense that it was just another thing she was failing at.\"I was just concentrating on the idea of, 'If I'm going to do this right, I need to find an hour in my day, I need to find an hour in my day,'\" Amodio said. \"Some days, I would sit down and I'd start to do it, and I'd get five minutes in and I'd hear the baby crying on the monitor; some days, I'd sit down and say, 'I'm going to do my hour,' and I'd think, but I'm so tired, I just want to sleep.\"But something clicked when she took a step back and asked herself, \"What is the purpose of this meditation? It's not to get an hour in. It's to get relaxed, and to re-center myself.\"Now, Amodio meditates daily after putting her daughter down for a late afternoon nap. She sits on a yoga mat or pillow in her living room with the windows thrown open to let in air and light, or with the blinds drawn, to create a sense of cozy calm. Other days, she goes out to the back deck of the Maryland home she shares with her husband. It faces the water, so she can sit and feel the breeze.\"Even if it's just 10 minutes of meditation a day,\" she said, \"that's my me-time.\"Jillian Amodio now averages around 20 minutes of meditation daily, despite being a busy freelancer and mom.This story appears in Issue 71 of our weekly iPad magazine, Huffington, available Friday, Oct. 18 in the iTunes App store.", "answers": {"answer_start": [127], "text": ["mindfulness"]}, "id": "387308661049012224"}, {"question": "What is the best snack before bedtime?

Keep in mind that snacking contributes to weight gain, and studies have found that nearly one-quarter of the calories we eat come from snacks.A banana, apple or other fresh fruit, a small portion of low-fat cottage cheese or plain yogurt with sliced fruit, or oatmeal or some other high-fiber cereal with skim milk were frequent suggestions made by experts interviewed for this article.Other suggestions included raw veggie sticks, a couple of whole grain crackers with a small slice of cheese, a handful of almonds or other nuts, or celery sticks spread with a tablespoon or two of peanut butter or almond butter (measure the nuts and butters \u2014 don\u2019t eat them straight out of the container).Combining carbohydrates with protein produces a filling, sating feeling, even from a small snack, Ms. Maples said.If you\u2019re in the mood for something salty and crunchy, air-popped popcorn may fit the bill, suggested Laura Smith, a product manager for Weight Watchers.It\u2019s important to note that many people become hungry at night because \"they eat too little during the day, and then by the time they get home, they can\u2019t stop, because they have built up a huge reservoir of starving inside,\" said Susan B. Roberts, a senior scientist and professor at the U.S.D.A. Nutrition Center at Tufts University, and founder of the online iDiet weight management program. For others, she said, snacking before bed may just be a bad habit.Also ask yourself: Are you really hungry? People often mistake thirst for hunger. Try drinking more throughout the day, and having more water or carbonated water with dinner.Before bed, try a glass of low-fat milk, hot or cold, noncaffeinated tea or, best of all, plain old water. \"Drinking water is clearly the least harmful item to have before bed,\" said Barry Popkin, a professor at the U.N.C.

After a long discussion about her work on the Disney movie (more on that in a bit), we concluded the chat talking about Jurassic World 2 and director J.A. Bayona taking the helm. Bryce Dallas Howard mentioned that she's been communicating with the filmmaker, and that she was actually going to be seeing Jurassic World director/producer Colin Trevorrow later that day, but also noted that it's weird talking about the sequel because of the restrictions on communication. She explained,Whenever I have the chance to be around that group, that crew I like get information. [laughter] J.A.'s over in Europe right now, so I haven't seen him in person.

So, tonight I'll just be like, 'Can you verbally explain to me what's happening?' But we'll shoot it next year.Studios and filmmakers are constantly looking for ways to prevent details about their upcoming projects leaking to the public, and one could see this being a very effective way. Sure, one can imagine that there's a risk of some material getting scrambled if stuff isn't being written down, but not putting anything in texts, emails or memos means that nobody is going to see material they aren't going to see (and at the most extreme level, it's safe from hackers).Jurassic World 2 has been seriously in the works for a while now, with J.A. Bayona coming aboard about four months ago. As Bryce Dallas Howard mentioned, the plan is to start filming next year, with Universal Pictures having put a flag in a June 22, 2018 release date. Howard will reprise her role as Claire Dearing, and Chris Pratt will be back as Owen Grady, and while Colin Trevorrow told us that a big theme of the movie will be the proliferation of dinosaurs, not much is known beyond that.We'll hopefully have more news for you about Jurassic World soon, but you can next see Bryce Dallas Howard in theaters in Pete's Dragon, which will be arriving in theaters on August 12th.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1333], "text": ["stuff isn't being written down"]}, "id": "832305003567652_851074201690732"}, {"question": "How to get the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus you want on launch day even without a preorder", "context": "Apple\u2019s brand new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus finally became a reality last week and as is always the case, people were surprised even though every single major detail had already been revealed. Leaks just never seem to do an adequate job of painting a complete picture when it comes to Apple\u2019s new iPhones. While some tech blogs saw the similar design and immediately assumed the new iPhones would be boring, we now know that\u2019s simply not the case. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are two of the sleekest smartphones we\u2019ve ever seen, and they also just so happen to be the fastest and most powerful handsets everNeedless to say, getting the model you want on launch day will be no easy task \u2014 but we do have some good news for you.Apple\u2019s new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were made available for preorder this past Friday and within just a few minutes, several models were already sold out. People generally kept their cool compared to previous years, but there are definitely thousands upon thousands of Apple fans out there upset that they weren\u2019t able to preorder the iPhone they wanted for launch day delivery.In fact, considering how quickly release day inventory of just about every iPhone 7 Plus model sold out, it\u2019s pretty safe to say that Apple has some serious supply constraints to contend with this year. This is likely one of several reasons Apple will not announce opening-weekend sales next week.Unless you woke up in the middle of the night to preorder the iPhone 7 Plus, odds are very good that you didn\u2019t get the model you wanted. In fact, launch-day inventory of several smaller iPhone 7 models has sold out as well, which means new preorders won\u2019t be delivered this coming Friday in many cases. But don\u2019t worry, because there are still ways for you to get your hands on the new iPhone 7 want this coming Friday.In a nutshell, you have two options. Apple Stores \u2014 especially larger, high-traffic stores \u2014 will have plenty of inventory on hand for people who didn\u2019t preorder a new phone. The problem, of course, is that Apple Stores are the first stop for most Apple fans on iPhone release day. If you\u2019re willing to head out early though, this is your best bet because Apple Stores always receive the most new iPhone units on release day. The catch is that everyone knows this, so you\u2019ll have to head out very early in the morning if you want to have any hope of getting a more popular iPhone model, such as anything in Jet Black.But there\u2019s also another option. As noted by a former AT&T sales associate who is currently a Verizon sales associate, carrier stores often get a decent amount of inventory on launch day. While most people head to the Apple Store to try to score a new iPhone, you could have a much easier time going to a carrier store. You should still plan to head out early, but you might be surprised at how easy it is to score a new iPhone compared to going to an Apple Store.\"Authorized retailers for your carrier typically get 5-6 new iPhones on launch day,\" Reddit user shashmalash wrote in a post . \"The dirty little secret though, is these retailers will get to the end of day and still have open iPhones to sell because most people are going to Apple and corporate carrier stores to get their iPhone without realizing there is barely a line at your local retailer.\"He continued, \"Worked at an AT&T retailer for 2 years and a Verizon retailer for the last 2 years and we ALWAYS have open iPhones to sell at the end of launch day so if you don\u2019t have a preorder, just try to hit up your local retailer and you\u2019ll probably walk out with an iPhone 7!\"A few other retail associates chimed in as well, but the takeaway is that even if you didn\u2019t manage to secure the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus you wanted when you tried to preorder one, there\u2019s still hope.", "answers": {"answer_start": [2739], "text": ["going to a carrier store"]}, "id": "52i518"}, {"question": "Police Find Something a Lot Scarier Than a Gun in Terence Crutcher\u2019s Car", "context": "An officer-involved shooting that took place over the weekend in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has drawn heavy criticism from the usual suspects in the Black Lives Matter movement and their allies in the liberal media.Video of the incident filmed from a helicopter overhead appeared to some to show a 40-year-old unarmed black man named Terence Crutcher with his hands over his head being shot and killed by white police officer Betty Shelby, seemingly confirming the narrative that police routinely use excessive force and deadly violence against black men who pose no threat to them.But according to Tulsa World, evidence was discovered in Crutcher\u2019s vehicle that, while unknown to the officers on the scene at the time, could nevertheless explain some of the man\u2019s behavior that led to the officer feeling compelled to fire her weapon.Inside the vehicle beside which Crutcher was shot and killed was discovered a vial of PCP, a highly dangerous drug that can often create a psychopathic and violent state of mind in its users.In fact, there were numerous anecdotal accounts of individuals on PCP who become nearly impervious to pain, including gunshots, continuing to attack police officers and innocent bystanders alike even as they are being shot repeatedly in locations that would instantly drop an ordinary non-drug using suspect.Another matter that could very well help explain Crutcher\u2019s attitude and actions during the incident was that he had a lengthy criminal rap sheet, including several counts of resisting arrest and prior drug convictions for which he had served time.It is also noteworthy that Crutcher had a warrant out for his arrest related to previous charges of resisting arrest and drug use, so he could have made clear through his words and attitude that he had no intention of peacefully being arrested or returning to prison.All of this is evidence that could conceivably corroborate the view of the officer on the scene who reportedly stated Crutcher looked \"like a bad dude\" who \"could be on something.\"It was expected that the medical examiner\u2019s office will release a toxicology report detailing whether Crutcher had the powerful drug in his system at the time of the incident, along with the rest of the broader autopsy report.", "answers": {"answer_start": [903], "text": ["vial of PCP"]}, "id": "547wz3"}, {"question": "LOOK: Crater on Mercury named after Beatles legend", "context": "Imagine John Lennon on Mercury.

According to data provided by Placed , a consumer habits data service provider that monitors behavior of more than 150,000 American consumers at 150 million locations daily, the most popular brands are primarily in the fast-food, discount retail and pharmacy segments.Half of the most visited retailers are fast-food chains. Placed founder and CEO David Shim explained that while you don\u2019t need household supplies every day, \"three times a day or more you need to eat, so there\u2019s a higher propensity to visit these types of businesses.\" The lower price per transaction at fast-food chains compared to other retailers also helps them to attract consumers, Shim noted.Consumers also regularly shop at the country\u2019s biggest drugstore chains and big-box retailers. In addition to selling widely purchased goods, these retailers have the most locations in the country. Walgreens, 7-Eleven and CVS Caremark all had more than 7,000 U.S. locations in 2012, among the most stores nationwide. Food chains were even more numerous. Subway, McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks were all among the top five companies by store count, each with well over 14,000 U.S. locations in 2012.Many of the most popular stores with consumers tended to have large advertising budgets. According to Shim, \"From our perspective, [advertising] dollars do matter in terms of driving traffic in the store.\" In fact, seven of the 10 most popular stores were among the top-spenders on advertising nationwide in 2011 and 2012, according to Advertising Age, a magazine providing market and industry data.Placed found that consumers\u2019 habits differed considerably by gender and income level. \"Fast food typically tends to skew more men than women,\" Shim said. In contrast, retail shoppers skew female. While men and women were equally likely to go to Starbucks, shoppers at Target were 16% more likely to be women, and Taco Bell diners were 13% more likely to be men.Americans making more than $100,000 per year were on the whole were more likely to shop at big-box retailers and drugstores than those making between $25,000 and $100,000. On the other hand, consumers making less than $25,000, were more likely to eat at three of the most popular fast food restaurants \u2014 Burger King, McDonald\u2019s and Taco Bell \u2014 than those making more than $100,000.To determine the nation\u2019s most popular stores, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from location analytics company Placed. Placed calculated the percentage of Americans who visited various stores in March 2014. The group also provided demographic and socioeconomic data on customers for various retailers and restaurants . These are indexed to a base of 100, representing the average American consumer. We also reviewed 2012 U.S. sales and store count data from the National Retail Federation\u2019s Stores.org, as well as advertising expenditure figures from AdAge covering 2011 and 2012.These are America\u2019s most popular stores:1.

Unlike many other popular destinations, Americans earning more than $100,000 a year were far less likely to visit Walmart than the average American. Walmart continues to grow, having increased its U.S. store count 3.3% to 4,570 locations in 2012. Walmart spent $1.8 billion on advertising in 2012, effectively unchanged from the year before, but still more than all but a handful of companies.2.

Although McDonald\u2019s remains hugely popular, its U.S. same-store sales declined by 1.7% this quarter from the same quarter the year before, with reports citing slowing service times and heightened competition. Among the company\u2019s plans to draw diners back to its stores is the recent unveiling of the newly redesigned Ronald McDonald, which attempts to make the icon more contemporary and less clown-like. Like several other popular stores, McDonald\u2019s Corp. has among the nation\u2019s largest advertising budgets, spending $1.4 billion on ads in 2012, up 4.2% from a year before.3.

Subway\u2019s expansion continued in 2012, with the number of stores growing 3.5% that year, among the biggest increases nationwide among major chains.

The coffee chain has changed its product lineup in recent years, introducing a range of foods, including a larger breakfast and lunch menu. The stores also continue to attract coffee drinkers with its free Wi-Fi. Unlike many other popular stores, Starbucks is less segmented by gender or age.

A group of academics reviewed all 682 paragraphs of the piece, titled \"Mexican Presidentialism and Alvaro Obregon,\" and found Pe\u00f1a Nieto plagiarized 197 paragraphs from 10 authors, and incorrectly cited them in 57 more. In 20 of these instances, he lifted sentences word-for-word, including from a book written by a former president. Here are examples, which Aristegui provided in her article.Even if you don\u2019t read Spanish, you can at least see all the words are the same. Aristegui\u2019s report comes at a time when the Mexican public is calling for a corruption investigation of the president, and when murders are rising in the country for the first time since he took office in 2012.Pe\u00f1a Nieto has already faced media ridicule for not being the country\u2019s smartest presidentduring his presidential campaign in 2011, he failed to name a single book that had influenced his life, except the Bible.

Some of those couples now have a child \u2014 the oldest might be a year old, if the first patient conceived right away.Other women treated during that period are pregnant, according to the hospital. And 13 couples have frozen embryos at the clinic, which they must now decide whether they want to replace.Meanwhile, the hospital is trying to figure out if any stray sperm actually managed to make a baby.It's also unknown how many contaminant sperm cells from how many men may have been used on patients.\"Everything will be done to provide clarity for everyone as soon as possible,\" the statement said.David Keefe, who chairs New York University's department of obstetrics and gynecology, said his own clinic is hesitant to perform the injections, unless absolutely necessary. The procedure was considered risky by many doctors until a few years ago \u2014 mostly because it was new.Now that it's been tested, Keefe said, it tends to be overused by patients in a hurry to have a child.\"This is one of many examples where it can go awry,\" he told The Washington Post. \"It's very sobering that one of the very best fertility centers in the most regulated country in the world still had risk.\"But he said that he suspected Utrecht was simply being cautious in halting the procedure and announcing its error.Technicians usually pick up a single sperm cell at a time in a syringe, Keefe said. \"The thought that one of them would have gotten up into the micro-manipulator is interesting, but I think theoretical. There aren't that many sperm to get up there.\"\"I suspect they're going to find out every one of those kids is from the right father,\" he said.Keefe was at odds with his friend and colleague at New York University: Arthur Caplan, who founded NYU's bioethics division and heads its medical ethics department.\"If there was contamination from a healthy donor, versus a male making barely any sperm . . . then the odds of the baby coming from contaminant sperm is like 100,000 to 1,\" Caplan said.And where Keefe described the Netherlands' fertility clinics as the very strictest in a highly regulated industry, Caplan has argued that the fertility industry isn't watched closely enough.Accidents are bound to happen, he said, and they often do.But he called the Utrecht case \"very unusual.\"He recalled many one-off and obvious mishaps \u2014 like a couple who sued a Chicago-area clinic, claiming they ordered sperm from a white donor but ended up with mixed-race child.Caplan remembered cases of mass malfeasance, too, like an Indiana doctor accused of impregnating at least eight patients with his own sperm.But those cases involved anonymous sperm banks.The Utrecht mishap could be \"deeply troubling to the male donor, because they were looking for their own biological child,\" he said. \"Most people would say, what choice do you have? You have to accept a child that was born in error.\"On the other hand, Caplan wondered what Utrecht will do to satisfy the unwitting source or sources of the errant sperm.\"What about the man or men?

Knoxville, Tennessee, occupied the top spot for three years in a row, from 2009 to 2011.On the whole, spring allergies are worse in the southern and eastern United States than the north and west, says James Sublett of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, because there are more deciduous trees simultaneously releasing pollen on those sides of the country.

They\u2019re smaller, cuter and have a sweet, subtle flavor. They also happen to cost a small fortune. But we buy them anyway because pine nuts make it worth it when we add them to our cooking \u2014 just think of all that summer pestoWe never put much thought into pine nuts, except to be sure to keep them in stock when we had bunches of summer basil to work with. But just recently we were informed by a colleague as to where pine nuts came from \u2014 an adorable origin it turns out \u2014 and we realized we do not know enough about our favorite small nut.We fixed that. And here\u2019s what we learned:1 Pine nuts come from pine cones. \uf118 Flickr: BobMacInnesOnce you read that sentence, it seems obvious. But we\u2019ll gladly admit that we had never put the two together until recently. But knowing this fact makes us love pine nuts even more. Read on to find exactly how they\u2019re formed.2 Some pine nuts take three years to mature. \uf118 Flickr: cogdogblogMost pine nuts take roughly 18 months, but some can take up to three years. They bud in the beginning of spring and grow until the end of summer. The cones become dormant during fall and winter and reach maturity come the following spring/summer season.3 Pine nuts are very difficult to harvest. \uf118 Flickr: brewbooksPine nuts are ready to harvest about 10 days before the green cone begins to open. The cones are dried in a burlap bag in the sun for 20 days, to speed up the process of drying and opening. The cones are then smashed (as a way to quickly release the seeds) and the seeds are separated by hand from the cone fragments. The fact that it takes a lot of time and patience is an understatement \u2014 and justifies the high price of pine nuts.4 The pine cone is only the pine nuts\u2019 first shell. \uf118 Flickr: ZwedlanaPine nuts have a second shell, which also has to be removed before eating. (Are you beginning to finally forgive the high price?) The shell varies from very thick and challenging to remove to thinner and therefore easier to handle.5 But pine nuts taste so good, so we deal with it. \uf118 Flickr: thebittenword.comThey make pestos possible. They\u2019re awesome toasted on top of pastas. They even give cookies an edge. Thank you pine nuts.6 Pine nuts prefer the Northern Hemisphere. \uf118 Flickr: Serge MelkiWhile all pine trees will produce a pine nut, there are only about 18 species that produce nuts large enough to be of value as human food. These trees are found in Asia, Europe and North America.7 Pine nut mouth is real. \uf118 Flickr: StuartWebsterPine nuts can cause taste disturbance. It\u2019s known as pine nut mouth or pine nut syndrome. It causes everything you eat to have a bitter, metallic taste. Luckily it\u2019s not permanent \u2014 it only lasts a couple of days. It\u2019s hypothesized that the particular species of pine responsible for this is the Pinus armandii in China.8 Pine nut allergies are real too. \uf118 Flickr: jules:stonesoupBut a whole lot less common.9 Not all pine nuts are created equal. \uf118 Flickr: the cardinal de la villeThe European variety are long and slender. Those from Asia are shorter and stubbier. The American pinyon nuts are larger and easier to shell.10 People have been eating pine nuts since the Paleolithic period. \uf118 Flickr: wetwebworkRoman soldiers took them as campaign food when they raided Britain over 2000 years ago.

Just two years after it was released, the touchscreens of thousands upon thousands of iPhone 6 Pluses are completely losing their functionality under normal use, which experts say is the long-term effect of the engineering flaw that gave us \"bendgate.\"By most accounts, dead touchscreens have become an iPhone 6 Plus epidemic, and yet the company has not commented on it, leaving consumers uninformed and harming independent repair businesses. In many cases, Apple has charged hundreds of dollars to replace a broken phone with a refurbished one that is subject to the same engineering defect that caused the phone to break in the first place.\"Touch Disease\"On the logic board of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, there are two tiny chips called \"Touch IC\" chips that translate your finger presses into machine-readable information. The thing is, these chips are located in a part of the iPhone 6 Plus that is particularly susceptible to bending and flexing, which is a known issue of the phone. The phone flexes ever-so-slightly thousands of times over the course of normal usage: as you pull it into and out of your pocket, or sit on it, or drop it. Eventually, all those-micro flexes add up, and the solder that holds the chips to the logic board comes loose, leading to a condition that the repair industry is calling \"touch disease.\"There are many different severities of touch disease, but its most common tell is a series of grey bars on the top of the iPhone\u2019s screen that is accompanied by intermittent touch screen responses. Some users report having to apply force to certain parts of their phone to temporarily reestablish touch functionality; others report having touch functionality on certain parts of their phone but not others; in many cases, the phone is completely unusable and unresponsive to touch. Replacing the screen itself is not a remedy, because the Touch IC chips are on the logic board of the phone.Because the iPhone 6 does not flex nearly as much as the iPhone 6 Plus, Touch IC problems are rare (but not unheard of) in the smaller phone. For the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, Apple moved the physical location of the Touch IC chips off of the logic board and onto the underside of the screen display itself, which is why 3D Touch is possible on those phones.\"It\u2019s absolutely a problem in the design. End users are not doing anything to cause this besides using the phone normally,\" Mark Shaffer of independent repair company iPad Rehab told me. \"Really all you can do is avoid any activity that would cause the phone to flex. Don\u2019t drop it, definitely don\u2019t put it in any case that requires you to apply force to the phone to get it into and out of the case. Don\u2019t put it in your back pocket, don\u2019t put it in your front pocket if it\u2019s a tight pocket. Actually, don\u2019t put it in any pocket.\"These are what the two IC Touch chips look like. Image: iFixitThat \"touch disease\" is happening is no secret. Independent repair experts I\u2019ve spoken to say that they\u2019ve seen the issue in iPhone 6 Pluses since soon after launch, but are seeing a major surge in the number of phones that have the issue as the warranties on the iPhone 6 expire and as the Touch IC connectors wear out with age.\"I feel like most of my job now is just replacing Touch ICs,\" Shaffer said. \"We really started doing them in November after the phones came off warranty and it\u2019s increased from a handful every month to now, we\u2019re seeing daily anywhere from five to 15.\"An excerpt from a class-action lawsuit demanding Apple address the issue.Moe Muscati, general manager of New York City\u2019s The Phone Works & Co. , told me that in the last few months the number of phones he\u2019s seen with this problem have skyrocketed.\"Let\u2019s say you have 10 iPhone 6 Pluses,\" he said. \"About five out of 10 that come in here have this problem.\"Jessa Jones, who started iPad Rehab said on a webinar dedicated to the issue that it\u2019s \"the single biggest defect we\u2019ve ever seen,\" adding that even phones that have been placed in heavy-duty Otterbox cases are beginning to have the issue.\"It kind of went from \u2018Hey we\u2019re seeing a lot of these\u2019 to \u2018Hey, we\u2019re seeing nothing but these,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t have the data to need to say how prevalent this is across all phones, but we\u2019re seeing this repair more than any other repair. We used to see it only with phones that got dropped, because that seems to exacerbate the problem. But now we\u2019re seeing phones that have been Otterboxed from the beginning starting to get them.\"Jones says she's been inundated with phones that have touch disease. Image: Jessa Jones/InstagramNo one has been able to nail down the actual number of phones that have this problem, but an Apple Insider report that cites anonymous Genius Bar employees at four large Apple Stores found that 11 percent of all iPhone-related service issues at those stores were related to Touch IC problems, and Touch IC issues made up about a third of all iPhone 6 Plus-related problems at those stores. AppleInsider and others have reported that Apple is well aware of the issue and Genius Bars even reportedly have a codename for the problemThe Apple support forums are filled with \" iPhone 6 Plus intermittent unresponsive screens ,\" and still the company has said nothing. Apple did not respond to my repeated requests for comment.If you work for Apple and have information relating to iPhone 6 Plus touchscreen problems, please email me: jason.koebler@vice.com or use our SecureDrop. My PGP key is here and I am available on OTR as well.In late August, the McCuneWright law firm filed a class-action lawsuit against Apple that claimed the company \"has long been aware of the defective iPhones.\"\"Notwithstanding its longstanding knowledge of this design defect, Apple routinely has refused to repair the iPhones without charge when the defect manifests,\" the lawsuit reads. \"Many other iPhone owners have communicated with Apple\u2019s employees and agents to request that Apple remedy and/or address the Touchscreen Defect and/or resultant damage at no expense. Apple has failed and/or refused to do so.\"Richard McCune, a partner at McCuneWright who is heading up the lawsuit, told me that since he\u2019s filed it, more than 6,500 people have contacted his firm saying that their phones have been affected.That Apple has been sued does not prevent the company from commenting on the issue and it doesn\u2019t prevent the company from offering a solution or at least letting customers know what to do if their touchscreen suddenly stops working. Earlier this year, for instance, Apple was sued about \"Error 53,\" an iOS feature that bricked iPhones that had their TouchID sensors replaced. While that case was still ongoing, Apple pushed a software update that fixed the issue.\"I suspect they haven\u2019t said anything about it because they don\u2019t have a fix for it, so they don\u2019t admit there\u2019s a problem, that they have tens of thousands of phones out there they have to do something about,\" McCune said. \"The thing I\u2019m really surprised at is that as much as Apple has worked on its brand image with customers, that it would allow this significant, widespread problem to be going on and not say a word.\"With the vast majority of iPhone 6 Pluses out of warranty at this point, if you take an iPhone 6 Plus with touchscreen problems to the Apple Store, Apple will charge between $100 and $329 to replace the phone, according to McCune\u2019s survey of customers, which also jives with Apple Insider\u2019s reporting and my own.But Apple\u2019s big problem is that the only way to reliably fix Touch IC issues is to remove the tiny chips themselves and replace them with new ones. This requires a microscope (to fix the problem properly you must be accurate to a millimeter level), a steady hand, and some serious microsoldering skills that are rare even in the repair industry. A handful of repair people like Jones and Shaffer have been inundated with requests to repair touch diseased phones , and we\u2019ve been able to piece together the mechanism of the phone\u2019s failure and Apple\u2019s repair protocols because of their analysis.\"People are coming in with a cracked screen and they\u2019re replacing it, but the phones still don\u2019t work, and independent shops are just absorbing the costs of that.\"Some repair people who perform the fix told me they believe that Apple just recycles phones that have broken Touch IC chips and doesn\u2019t bother to repair them. Others have said they\u2019ve found leftover solder flux on logic boards that have touch disease, suggesting that Apple has refurbished them.\"They have no incentive to repair anything or to offer us any help. Why invest in this complicated repair when they can throw it in the garbage and give you a brand new one?\" Thomas Heffernan of Burlington, Vermont\u2019s Wires Computing, who repairs Touch IC issues, told me. \"Either way, they\u2019re selling a new phone to somebody, whether it\u2019s your insurance company or it\u2019s you.\"Removing solder around the Touch IC's spot on the logic board. Image: Microsoldering/YouTubeIn practice, Apple is not ever repairing and returning your phone, and so the service Apple offers is not a repair one but a replacement one, meaning that if you take your phone into the Apple Store with a problem, chances are you\u2019ll pay between $100 and $329 for a refurbished replacement phone.The problem with refurbished iPhone 6 Pluses is that Apple is replacing one phone with an inherent design flaw with another phone that both has that same design flaw and has old parts from a phone that was broken and has been repaired. Most people probably know that a getting a refurbished phone is not exactly like getting a new phone, but by refusing to acknowledge that the Touch IC problem is in the actual engineering of the phone itself and not in how people are using the phones, Apple isn\u2019t really giving consumers the full story.To ensure the phones don\u2019t break again, iPadRehab has taken to soldering an extra heat shield above the chips that allows the logic board to flex more without unseating the Touch IC chips, which so far has seemed to be the only reliable long-term fix to the issue.\"As time goes on more and more devices that I see are Apple refurbished\"Repair experts I spoke with say that they are increasingly seeing touch disease on Apple-designated replacement phones. They say they often see refurbished phones with bent or warped logic boards that have clearly been recycled from other damaged phones and are thus more susceptible to touch disease. Apple offers a much reduced 90-day warranty on refurbished products, meaning there\u2019s really no guarantee that the $329 refurbished replacement phone will last much longer than three months. In a Facebook post , Ben Duffy of Australia's Geelong MicroSoldering, which repairs Touch IC issues, wrote he had \"personally encountered replacement devices issued by Apple ... that not only have the same issue, but have been recycled from very clearly bent devices (the board inside the device is bent, however the device is not).\"The Apple support thread on this issue is 76 pages long and is full of people who have found themselves with Touch IC issues more than once.\"The uncool thing Apple is doing is knowingly giving someone a refurbished phone for $329, knowing that phone has a board in it that came from another phone,\" Jones said.Shaffer told me that Apple-refurbished phones are getting touch disease and are making their way to his microscope.\"There are some telltale signs we know to look for to tell if it\u2019s a refurbished phone. They put a little blue mark near the top of the board, and there\u2019s this glue near the CPU shield that isn\u2019t on any other phones,\" Shaffer said. \"When we look up the model number, there are codes that signify it\u2019s a refurbished or replacement device. I did seven last night and three were refurbished.\"The jury-rigged heat shields that iPad Rehab puts on their touch disease repairs. The top image shows the shield off of the logic board, and the second shows the shield when installed. Images: Mark ShafferDuffy told me in an email that he \"sees Apple refurbished devices daily.\"\"There is definitely evidence Apple have someone repairing [touch diseased] devices as they don't even make an effort to clean the flux any more,\" he said. \"As time goes on more and more devices that I see are Apple refurbished. In the case of the 6 Plus, many of them have warped or bent motherboards, and in many cases the issues they have are directly related to the repair that has been previously performed.\"\"I think Apple need to make it clear that when you get a \u2018replacement device\u2019 that it is not equal to a new device, and was returned by another customer with issues like Touch IC,\" he added. \"There is a common belief that consumers are better off taking a device to Apple for replacement as they are then getting a \u2018new\u2019 device. Not only is that not true, but Apple don't explain this to people. What they do do, on the support forums and in store, is tell people that independent repair is a bad move. The reality is that in most cases, you are better having your device repaired by an independent technician as they will disclose what they are doing to repair an issue.\"The Toll on Independent RepairApple\u2019s silence isn\u2019t just hurting consumers. While people who can actually repair a logic board are seeing a huge bump in their businesses, those who traffic in run-of-the-mill screen replacements and the like are facing an entirely different issue. Because dropping a phone can trigger a Touch IC problem, there are lots of phones that have both cracked screen and touch disease.\"People bring in the phone with a cracked screen expecting a simple cheap repair,\" Heffernan said. \"Then you tell them it\u2019s probably a motherboard issue and they don\u2019t believe you. They say \u2018Is it something you did?\u2019 \u2018Did you break my phone?\u2019\"This is a story I heard over and over again. Without official Apple acknowledgment of the issue, independent repair shops either have to get very good at explaining to customers that they might be screwed or have to be very selective about what phones they will take. Muscati of Phone Works & Co\u2014which does not have the ability to do Touch IC repairs\u2014says before his shop became aware of widespread Touch IC problems, he would replace customers\u2019 phones thinking that his techs had broken them.\"It\u2019s unquestionably has hurt us a lot because we want to do good customer service, and we were worried that a customer would think it was our fault and sue us,\" he said. \"A lot of times we will refuse to do any repair on an iPhone 6 Plus because of how often we see the problem.\"Signs that touch disease is happening to Apple's refurbished phones: The top image has a telltale blue mark. The 'N' on the model number (from the same phone, powered up), signifies that it is a replacement device. Images: Mark ShafferI called up Dan Rivoire, director of iFixit Pro, which sells wholesale parts to repair professionals around the country, to see if Muscati\u2019s story sounded plausible.\"I had the same conversation with three shops over the last week,\" Rivoire said. \"People are coming in with a cracked screen and they\u2019re replacing it, but the phones still don\u2019t work, and shops are just absorbing the costs of that. The shops that know about this problem are doing their best to mitigate the problem of angry customers by explaining up front that they may not be able to fix it.\"Apple has a long history of making life difficult for repair people who are unaffiliated with Apple, but the company has also never faced an iPhone hardware issue that Jones calls a \"classic, signature failure.\"Repairing these phones en masse or issuing a recall is probably not possible or likely at this point, but Jones, iFixit, and others are calling for Apple to extend the warranty on refurbished iPhone 6 Pluses. At the very least, they say, Apple needs to acknowledge the engineering flaw and tell customers that refurbished phones may be susceptible to this problem.So far, the story of the iPhone 6 Plus touch disease has been one that\u2019s been pieced together by consumers, unaffiliated repair professionals, and vague statements by anonymous employees at Apple Stores. I asked Apple for comment on this story twice, and emailed a separate Apple contact I have, who works in a separate branch of Apple\u2019s PR team. He told me he had forwarded the email to the appropriate person. Apple did not respond to my questions.It would be useful to know how often the company is seeing this issue, what the standard protocol is for customers who bring touch diseased phones to Apple Stores, whether Apple actually does Touch IC repairs itself, and whether it plans on offering an extended warranty, discounted upgrades, or any other fixes to people whose phones have suddenly stopped working.In any case, Apple will have to respond to McCune\u2019s lawsuit at some point, likely before the end of the month.

In fact, this one trait is behind the success of all people that have performed massively better than the average person. Read on to find out what the trait is and how you can put it into practice in your own life and investing.The most important factor for successAccording to Alice Schroeder, in 1991 when Bill Gates' dad asked Buffett and Gates what the most important factor for their success was, they both gave the same answer, \"focus.\"Gates' focus was illustrated in Walter Isaacson's new book The Innovators, as well as Gates' fellow Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen:One trait that differentiated the two was focus. Allen's mind would flit between many ideas and passions, but Gates was a serial obsessor. \"Where I was curious to study everything in sight, Bill would focus on one task at a time with total discipline,\" said Allen. \"You could see it when he programmed. He would sit with a marker clenched in his mouth, tapping his feet and rocking; impervious to distraction.\"Steve Jobs was the same way; he was relentlessly focused on attacking problems searching for the best answer. Apple's founding marketing philosophy had three main tenets the second of which is focus:In order to do a good job of those things we decide to do we must eliminate all of the unimportant opportunities.Focus was key for Buffett as well, Schroeder writes: \"He ruled out paying attention to almost anything but business\u2014art, literature, science, travel, architecture\u2014so that he could focus on his passion.\"Why is this so important?In life and investing, you need to be relentlessly focused on your goals if you want to have better than average results.DifferentiationTo stick out from the crowd, you need to do something better than everyone else. There's no standard definition of what \"better\" is though. McDonald's does low prices and quick drive through service while Chipotle does massive burritos with a great service culture . They both have been wildly successful as they focus on doing one thing well.What gets companies and people into trouble is when they try and do too much, leading to mediocrity.McDonalds has been suffering lately as its menu has grown to accommodate so many different items that is has gotten unwieldy , leading to a confusing menu and longer wait times.Apple was a disaster with 350 different products before Jobs came back in 1998. He refocused the business around the customer experience, simplifying Apple's focus to just 10 products. Everyone knows the rest of the story.Successful investingLike success in life and business, to be successful in investing, you need focus and time if you want to do better than average. As Warren Buffett has explained,\"Successful Investing takes time, discipline and patience. No matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: You can't produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.\"Just getting to average performance is hard enough. While by definition, the average investor cannot do better than average, the average investor would do nearly 80% better if he or she simply earned the average market return. Most investors would be better off in index funds.The first key part to be successful is to learn the mistakes that hold people back and avoid them. For investors these include being too active , overconfident , loss-averse , taking on debt to invest , and making rash decisions based on daily market movements , among others.The second part is to know what your goals are and have a process where you constantly learn, think independently , and quickly try and figure out when you are wrong . You need to go put in the effort so that you can evaluate a selection of businesses and build a circle of competence , that is a set of businesses and industries that you can understand and can independently evaluate. Only then will you be able to select businesses whose values are misjudged by the market, providing an opportunity for you to profit.

All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.Most people don't do this. The key is to realize the limits of your knowledge, you can't know and be good at everything.

And that\u2019s actually a good thing\u2014peppering your workout schedule with off days is often key for reaching your fitness goals because the time to recuperate can help your muscles get even stronger. But there\u2019s some confusion about what it really means to take a \"rest day,\" a topic celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson covers in a new interview with The Cut.\"As long as you\u2019re not being invasive for your body and muscles, you don\u2019t need a day to relax and repair. You need a day to relax and repair when you\u2019re abusing your body,\" she says in the interview. But that\u2019s actually not true\u2014taking a step back from your typical workouts is often a great idea, and it\u2019s not only necessary if you\u2019re \"abusing\" your body. \"You can\u2019t expect someone to \u2018go hard\u2019 day in and day out and not think accumulated fatigue won\u2019t enter the picture at some point,\" Boston-based certified strength and conditioning specialist Tony Gentilcore, tells SELF.Keep in mind that taking a rest day doesn\u2019t always mean doing absolutely nothing, as Anderson notes: \"It\u2019s so important to connect to yourself every day,\" she tells The Cut. But there\u2019s a middle ground between a complete rest day and breaking a real sweat. That\u2019s why Gentilcore and many other fitness experts recommend adding active recovery days into your workout routine. Basically, it means you engage in gentle activity to allow your body to rest and rebuild muscle fibers that you tear while exercising. That can be anything from going for a walk to doing light yoga or taking a chill bike ride\u2014the key is to get up and moving. And a major perk is that this kind of activity can make your actual workouts even more effective. Consider active recovery the fitness rule you don\u2019t want to break.Albert Matheny, M.S., R.D., C.S.C.S., of SoHo Strength Lab and Promix Nutrition, is a fan of active recovery. \"Active recovery is better than a rest day because your body and muscles recover faster with light work rather than complete rest,\" he tells SELF. Active recovery helps deliver blood to your muscles quickly, bringing nutrients and oxygen to help the muscles repair and recover, he says.Although this would happen even if you were at rest, the benefit of active recovery is that oxygen-rich blood pumps through your body faster when you\u2019re moving, giving your muscles more of the fuel they need to repair the micro-tears that occur when you work out, Matheny explains.\"Active recovery days can be important in maintaining momentum while training,\" Doug Sklar, a certified personal trainer and founder of New York City-based fitness training studio PhilanthroFIT, tells SELF. \"Rather than completely forgo fitness, active recovery days allows you to do something healthful while still allowing your body to recover from a previous higher intensity workout.\"How you incorporate active recovery depends on the type and intensity of exercise you\u2019re doing, as well as your personal goals. \"But generally speaking, it\u2019s a good idea to balance high-intensity workouts with lighter work,\" Sklar says. Meaning, if you go for a long run one day, cut yourself some slack and go easier the next day. To help you figure it all out, here\u2019s what a perfect week of working out looks like.Gentilcore says it\u2019s also important to give yourself a break and take a full day of rest if you need it\u2014physically or mentally. Maybe you\u2019re sick, injured, would rather spend time celebrating a friend\u2019s birthday than working out, or have any other very valid reason to skip an exercise session. Sometimes life gets in the way, and if you can\u2019t always fit exercise in, that\u2019s OK.Also know this: Rest and recovery days won\u2019t derail your fitness goals. \"Just like you can\u2019t become super-fit after one workout, you won\u2019t lose all that you\u2019ve worked for by taking one day off,\" says Sklar.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1377], "text": ["active recovery days"]}, "id": "550ioc"}, {"question": "Ghostbusters: The first reviews are in and the verdict is...", "context": "The new Ghostbusters film has faced criticism (Picture: Columbia Pictures)The first reviews of the Ghostbusters reboot are in and it seems to be a mixed bag.Ghostbusters review: In a film dominated by women, it\u2019s Chris Hemsworth who delivers the most fun The new film, directed by Paul Feig, features an all-female cast with Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones replacing Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson from the original.The reboot has received flak over its gender swap concept while the film\u2019s trailer became the most disliked in YouTube history.At the premiere of the film at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, McCarthy blasted the film\u2019s critics saying: \u2018Any time someone critiques something that has not yet been made, I find peculiar.\u2018It\u2019s like giving a book review to an author who\u2019s like \"I haven\u2019t written it yet\".\u2018I don\u2019t pay much attention to it.

Another quick win. There's not much else to say here. It was predictable and sets up the Owens/Jericho collision at WrestleMania and raises the stakes for the Goldberg/Lesnar match.Totals (1 possible point for each)-- Sean CoyleGoldberg defeated Kevin Owens after a distraction from Chris Jericho, becoming the second-oldest WWE world champion in the company's history at age 50. This victory also sets the stage for Goldberg's scheduled match for WrestleMania 33 against Brock Lesnar to be the prohibitive favorite to occupy the traditional main event slot at the biggest show of the year.With less than a minute left in the traditional broadcast window, there was very little hope that the match for the WWE Universal Championship match at Fastlane -- which started at 10:59 -- would amount to anything but spear, jackhammer, 1-2-3. As WWE stretched the broadcast beyond that traditional window, however, with Owens sliding out of the ring to waste time, several other possibilities seemed to be possible.Owens teased getting back into the ring several times, playing mind games with his intense opponent by stepping back out and pacing on the outside of the ring. Even after fully stepping back into the ring once, Owens immediately dropped down and rolled under the bottom rope. The entire escapade lasted more than five minutes.As Owens finally prepared himself for the match and beckoned Goldberg to the middle of the ring, thinking he'd already gotten through much of his opponent's stamina, Jericho's music hit just seconds before the bell finally rang to start the match. As Owens turned, incredulous that his long-time best friend had arrived, Goldberg promptly hit a spear.Owens writhed on the ground in pain for several seconds before being picked up and dropped by a jackhammer. Three seconds later, Goldberg became the third ever WWE Universal champion.This loss ends Owens' reign as Universal champion at 188 days.

It'll take a lot of work and there are a lot of problems that need to be addressed,\" he said. Zients is a former official at the White House Office of Management and Budget and will become director of the White House National Economic Council at the beginning of next year. The administration has described his involvement with Obamacare implementation as short-term.Reaching this newly announced late-November target would give consumers as little as two weeks to choose a health insurance plan that would be in place at the beginning of next year. Because of lag times between selecting coverage and its effective date, the latest an individual or family could make the first payment to their insurer is Dec. 15 if they want benefits in place by Jan. 1.This latest assessment follows months of assurances by Obama and numerous administration officials that HealthCare.gov would be fully operational when it debuted Oct. 1, including statements made just days before the online marketplace launched.The administration expected to enroll 7 million people into health coverage via the more than 30 exchanges being run by the federal government and the more than a dozen operated by states, based on Congressional Budget Office projections. The open enrollment period for 2014 runs until March 31.The health insurance exchanges have processed about 700,000 applications for financial assistance to date, and almost half came through the federal system, which includes HealthCare.gov, a telephone hotline and paper applications, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokeswoman Julie Bataille.Applications for tax credits to cut health insurance costs aren't the same as actual enrollments, however. Consumers eligible for financial assistance also must choose a private health plan and make a payment to be enrolled. The Obama administration won't release enrollment figures until the middle of next month, though some state-run health insurance exchanges are reporting tens of thousands of enrollments into private health insurance and Medicaid so far.In a major shift, the administration has assigned a private company as the \"general contractor\" overseeing the federal health insurance exchanges and HealthCare.gov, Zients said. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had been responsible for coordinating the multiple contractors working on the technology until now, and contractors at a House committee hearing Thursday said it was the agency's decision to postpone full testing of the system until the two weeks before its Oct. 1 launch.A unit of the health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group will take over this coordination, Zients said. Quality Software Services Inc., or QSSI, is a unit of Optum, a UnitedHealth Group company. UnitedHealth Group was not among the health insurance companies represented at a meeting with White House officials Wednesday.QSSI built the data hub used by the federally managed and state-run health insurance exchanges, which serves as the conduit for information transmitted between consumers, multiple government computer systems and health insurance companies. Despite concerns prior to the debut of the exchanges, the data hub has performed well, Zients said.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is expanding QSSI's existing contract, Bataille said. The administration will not disclose what other companies or individuals are participating in the Obamacare \"tech surge.\"\"There's a clear path forward,\" Zients said. \"There's a 'punch list' of fixes, and we're going to punch them out one by one.\" Issues include problems on the user end, such as navigating through the registration, application and enrollment processes, and on the back end, like health insurance companies receiving corrupted data about their new customers, he said. \"There will be a relentless focus on speed and execution to work through the punch list. Each week the site will get better.\"The administration also is looking into rectifying a quirk with the enrollment deadlines that could subject some people to a portion of the tax penalties for violating the law's individual mandate to have insurance. Currently, consumers would have to select a health plan by Feb. 15 to avoid partial penalties. The administration is working to ensure that anyone who buys health insurance by the end of enrollment on March 31 won't be penalized, Bataille said.

There was the reported size of the settlement, $20 million , which employment lawyers say is the largest single plaintiff pre-trial settlement for sexual harassment charges they know of (many are settled privately).But perhaps the most striking aspect of the settlement was the company's public apology to Carlson in its statement, a move employment lawyers said was extremely rare, if not unprecedented, when it comes to sexual harassment claims.\"Typically the last thing a plaintiff ever receives in a pre-trial settlement is an apology,\" said Debra Katz, a Washington lawyer who often represents plaintiffs in sexual harassment lawsuits. \"It clearly is a recognition that she was right that she was treated inappropriately, and that in and of itself is quite stunning.\"In its statement, 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News, where Carlson was a former anchor and Ailes was its powerful chairman until recently, praised Carlson's skills and said it was \"proud\" she had been part of the organization. \"We sincerely regret and apologize for the fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect and dignity that she and all of our colleagues deserve,\" the In its statement, 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News, where Carlson was a former anchor and Ailes was its powerful chairman until recently, praised Carlson's skills and said it was \"proud\" she had been part of the organization. \"We sincerely regret and apologize for the fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect and dignity that she and all of our colleagues deserve,\" the statement readMore typically, if a settlement is announced at all -- many sexual harassment claims stay quietly under wraps -- it comes with a \"non-statement,\" says Amy Bess, an employment lawyer at Vedder Price.

It's gotten rid of the evil doers, and they're now focusing on a more positive, proactive, non-discriminatory culture that is a good place for women to work.\"Most companies don't make such a statement of regret because it could expose them to some risk. \"It's n ot an admission of legal liability, but it\u2019s still saying she was not treated with the dignity she deserved to be treated with,\" says Dan Eaton, a San Diego-based employment lawyer. \"It sugg ests a company may be amenable to making a settlement on similar terms in future cases.\" (A spokesperson for 21st Century Fox declined to comment about why the company chose to make the apology, but pointed to earlier statements about its prompt investigation and the seriousness with which it has taken the allegations.)Yet in this case, employment lawyers said, Carlson is thought to have negotiated for and demanded nothing less than a public apology. \"Fox, in acknowledging she was treated badly, may be signaling to other employees that there\u2019s going to be a culture change, that they're not going to tolerate this kind of behavior,\" Katz said. \"But I'm confident that she insisted upon it.\" (A message to Carlson's lawyer was not immediately returned.)That's partly because it's one of the most basic things plaintiffs desire when they consider pursuing a sexual harassment suit, Katz says. \"It's usually the first thing people who walk into my office want,\" she says. \"We're not just talking about explosive, high-profile claims like this. Even in the most mundane employment situations, people want an acknowledgement. But it's usually the last thing they get.\" Katz said none of her clients had ever received a public apology for similar claims.Besides an apology, one other thing Carlson will be getting, meanwhile, is a $20 million settlement. The size of that payout is larger than any known pre-trial settlement for a sexual harassment claim by a single plaintiff, Katz said, noting that such figures are often kept private. Its size likely reflects Carlson's high compensation as a media figure, as payouts are often determined based on loss of future income. Yet for Fox, Katz said, \"it's a rounding error. The bigger cost is everything else\" -- the legal costs, the reputation damage -- \"that has exploded as a result.\"While $20 million may be larger than other settlements for similar claims, it's also, interestingly, exactly half the size of the exit package Ailes was reportedly paid. After Ailes stepped down as the chairman and CEO of Fox News in July, just two weeks after Carlson's lawsuit was filed, reports said he would receive more than $40 million and remain an adviser to Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of 21st Century Fox.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1452], "text": ["extremely rare"]}, "id": "51hk3l"}, {"question": "The world's deepest pool is 131 feet of total craziness", "context": "An indoor pool in Italy is giving new meaning to the deep end and it's slightly terrifying.It's not quite as scary as swimming in a glass-bottom pool above the Shanghai skyline or as overwhelming as the world's largest pool in Chile, but the Y-40 pool in Italy is equally cool.The pool was designed by architect Emanuele Boaretto and is housed on the grounds of Hotel Terme Millepini near Padua, Italy.

And it doesn\u2019t look like EA\u2019s next installment will entertain that idea, either.With popular shooters such as Call of Duty and Overwatch including female characters in their multiplayer formats, it\u2019s become quite the norm to play as a woman with guns blazing. However, the Battlefield franchise has never provided this feature, and Battlefield 1 will be no different. (Note that this is regards to online multiplayer only, because there is a playable female character in the story mode.)What\u2019s really entertaining is the reason behind this decision. Originally, females were going to be integrated as playable multiplayer characters, but then the idea was scrapped due to boys not finding it believable. Former DICE coder, Amanda Coget, took to Twitter in order to discuss how the conversation went down.Even though female soldiers in WWI was not a common thing, it happened. And even though Battlefield is more realistic with its play style in comparison to other shooters, it\u2019s still a video game.There is a ton of room for interpretation when it comes to developing battles and fighting because despite how realistic a game is, it\u2019s still pretty fictional. (I mean come on, respawning multiple times in a match is realistic, but playing as a female soldier isn\u2019t?)I\u2019ve never classified myself as a feminist by any means, but this is ridiculous. It\u2019s not upsetting that Battlefield 1 won\u2019t have female soldiers (in multiplayer), but it\u2019s highly offensive that they are catering to boys that wouldn\u2019t find the idea believable. The concept is understandable, but the reasoning is not.This isn\u2019t the first time the game attempted to accommodate to the less informed consumer. EA originally ditched the idea of a World War I setting because they were concerned that kids didn\u2019t know that it actually happened.UPDATE 6/15/16: I just want to clear the air regarding the reasoning behind this article. It is not to start a debate about social equality, women\u2019s rights, or anything of that nature. I don\u2019t care if I have to play a game as a man, woman, alien, worm, or even a piece of chewed up bubble gum; I just like to play video games, regardless of the characters available.

So I decided to give up my lunch break to get a 30-minute rose power peel I've heard other beauty editors chatting about.Skincare creator and aesthetician Cecilia Wong employs a combination of Bulgarian and French rose oils, lemon and papaya extracts, LED light therapy and oxygen for a facial treatment that reduces hyperpigmentation (my biggest skincare woe), soothes sun damage and plumps up the skin. She assured me that I'd get off the table with a camera-ready complexion, and that's all she really had to say for me to lie down.Wong started the process by cleansing and then smoothing on a rose petal yogurt peel packed with antioxidants and vitamins A, C, D and E. The scent was heavenly, yet not heady as if I was stuck in a field of flowers.Next, she did a jade roller massage using her Reviving Black Currant Serum. Blended with black currant, blueberry and carrot seed oils, as well as argan oil, she explained that the black currant is actually one of the most potent sources of vitamin C. \"It has 5 times more vitamin C than an orange! It brightens and is a great exfoliation to slough off dry skin,\" said Wong. The roller helped the serum to penetrate deeper into my pores and open up the point meridians to achieve softer skin.The LED light therapy, which stimulates collagen production, was surprisingly painless (keeping my eyes closed to avoid the blinding light was tricky, so protective sunglasses would have helped), and I even dozed off during the process.Wong completed the treatment with a blast of oxygen (the cool tingling sensation could be compared to one of those air in a can dusters) infused with aloe gel, hyaluronic acid and her secret rose serum. Once I was able to snap back into reality, I woke up to see that my face was much brighter and fuller.

The area, just west of Tahoe National Forest, is home to dense forests, crystal-blue lakes and hills that sparkle with the mineral deposits that gave the area its famous nickname -- Gold Country.The region was the focus of the 1849 Gold Rush, California's great legacy, which led to San Francisco's founding and California's statehood. But the Gold Rush left the state with a darker legacy, as well.In a study published online last week, researchers revealed that mercury from Gold Rush-era mining operations continues to seep into California\u2019s primary water system -- and it may get worse with climate change.\"There\u2019s a tremendous amount of sediment, and the concentrations are so high that it really is scary,\" said the lead author, Michael Singer, a researcher for University of St. Andrews in Scotland and University of California, Santa Barbara. \"This is a problem of DDT proportions,\" he said, referring to the insecticide that inspired Rachel Carson's environmental book Silent Spring.Left from unsafe gold mining practices of the 1800s, the mercury is trapped in sediment in the Sierra Nevada foothills. According to the study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, floods continue to force the toxic metal downstream, adding more mercury to the water system.If climate change predictions are correct, floods and the amount of mercury-laden sediment they force into the water system are likely to increase.\"People assume that it\u2019s no longer a problem, that it\u2019s just a matter of cleanup,\" said Singer. \"But we\u2019ve found that new mercury is entering the system and replenishing the supply. Not only is the mercury already in the water system, but it\u2019s continuing to enter it with each major flood.\"Once the mercury enters the water system and gets downstream, some of it converts to methylmercury, a highly toxic substance absorbed by small organisms, and makes its way up the food chain. When consumed in unsafe levels, such as those found in the Sierra Nevada sediment, the contaminant causes mercury poisoning, affecting the nervous system and causing loss of brain function and coordination. Mercury poisoning can also cause reproductive problems, including birth defects and infertility.Downstream from the Sierra Nevada foothills is the San Francisco Bay Delta Estuary, the nexus of California\u2019s statewide water system and the largest estuary on the west coasts of both North America and South America. The high content of methylmercury not only threatens the fish that live in the estuary, but also the migratory birds that feed on them.While California has no documented cases of mercury poisoning in humans due to Sierra Nevada contamination, the effects have begun showing up in birds. \"The whole food web is being exposed to this issue,\" said Singer.While Singer's study offers new insight into the extent of the problem, the area\u2019s unusually high levels of mercury already were well known. Since discovering the levels in the 1970s, the state and regional water quality control boards have been aggressively using erosion control, sediment removal and remediation efforts at mining sites.\"People started measuring the mercury levels in fish caught in the area and it was at these really high levels,\" said Mark Stephenson, a researcher with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. \"That\u2019s what started all of these programs like Mussel Watch [a contaminant monitoring program]. It really sounded the alarm bell.\"Stephenson has noticed the same conditions Singer described in his paper, and was not surprised by the results, citing climate change as a potential factor that could exacerbate the problem.\"The amount of mercury coming downstream is proportional to the storm. From our research, we\u2019ve found that about 90 percent of the mercury deposits in the past five years came from five major storms -- about one per year,\" Stephenson told HuffPost. \"Some studies have essentially said that due to climate change, infrequent but severe storms are increasing in regularity and intensity. If that\u2019s correct, there will be more mercury mobilized.\"Some policymakers have called the fears overstated.\"After an exhaustive review of all the science surrounding the mercury debate, it is clear that some special-interest groups are crying wolf,\" wrote Richard Pombo, a former state representative, in a 2005 report by the House Resources Committee during the Bush administration. The report was released in anticipation of new regulatory proposals.Representatives from California's mining industry did not deny the mercury problem in a phone call with HuffPost. They urged a look at the bigger picture.\"I'll be the first to say that the mercury is a potential problem,\" said Craig Lindsay, president of Western Mining Alliance. \"But when we're looking at big, complex ecosystems, we need to be careful not to point fingers at just one factor.\"Lindsay said he and other miners have been pulling mercury out of the water long before government agencies took notice. He said he shares Singer's concerns about flooding, but doesn't believe the results are conclusive.\"If you have the flood of the millennium, yeah, there's going to be a lot of mercury moved downstream -- that's a given,\" Lindsay said. \"How that's going to impact the ecosystem in the delta? That's a more complex question.\"High above the delta in Sierra Gold Country, the Nevada Irrigation District has recently completed a pilot project that organizers hope could prevent such a scenario.For the past five years, Rem Scherzinger, general manager of the Nevada Irrigation District, has been working with his team on a program to dredge mercury-laden sediment from the Bear River and Lake Combie, both of which eventually flow into the delta.

You kind of hate yourself after indulging in it, the Internet equivalent of being force-fed melted Jolly Ranchers by the spoonful. But as much as clickbait\u2019s trickster headlines inspire self-loathing, it hardly compares to the amount of ill-will it engenders toward traffic-hungry, trigger-happy media outlets that think firing off lots of popcorny articles, shotgun-style, will net them a few extra ad impressions.Well, Facebook users are fed up with clickbait headlines, and they\u2019re fighting back with one of the only tools at their disposal: the like button.For a while now, users have told Facebook in surveys they prefer headlines that spell out what\u2019s contained in the story. That doesn\u2019t stop them from clicking on stories that leave the news out of the title, though \u2014 and that's reflected in the data Facebook gathers on its users, said Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management.\"If you measure just clicks, no, they'll click more on things where you're actually withholding things in the title,\" he said. \"But they'll spend less time actually reading it once they click.\"That makes some amount of sense. But Mosseri continued: \"Another pattern we see is that they'll like a story, click on it, and come back immediately because they feel deceived and un-like it. We do see that reflected in behavior.\"Facebook revealed how its News Feed displays content. This came in response after last month's new report alleging liberal political bias in its Trending Topics feature. (Reuters)People who feel misled are actively going back to the News Feed and removing their likes from stories, according to Facebook. That's significant. It's an extra step, an act of commission, one that takes time and thought. And it's an interesting way users who lack other means to voice their displeasure have devised as a kind of stop-gap measure for fighting back.It\u2019s unclear how widespread this practice is, and Facebook declined to elaborate. But given the incredible importance that likes and engagement can have on the performance of a given article, it does suggest that there\u2019s a limit to the traction publishers may get from clickbait.[Facebook will now let you manage what happens to your account after you die]Researchers who've investigated clickbait seem to have settled on a few theories as to why it works. The key finding is that clickbait headlines generate an emotional response that in many ways is out of our control. In one recent paper, computer scientists concluded after analyzing tens of thousands of headlines that the more intensely aligned a headline was toward a positive or negative emotion, the more likely it would be to produce a click.Clickbait also exploits the reward centers of our brains. As Wired wrote last year, you can \"think of that clickbait headline as a signal, an imminent sign you\u2019re about to see some super-adorbz animal buddies. ... You might assume our brains get that wonderful squirt of dopamine after we get the reward (the pics), but it turns out dopamine levels go up much sooner.\"In fact, the mere sight of a clickbait headline is enough to trigger the release of happy chemicals, psychologists have found.In light of that research, it makes total sense why you might be outraged by an article that didn't produce the expected reward. The feeling, too, that you've been manipulated or cheated by some process you're helpless to resist only heightens the resentment. And to hear that some users are taking back their likes shows how little power they have to express themselves and force the system to change.Facebook has periodically taken steps to address clickbait. In 2014, it tweaked its algorithm over concerns that those types of articles could \"drown out\" other types of content. It did so again earlier this year to prioritize stories that the company thought people actually wanted to read. In both moves, an important metric Facebook considered was the amount of time users spent, or were expected to spend, on a given story \u2014 the idea being that the longer you take before coming back to Facebook, the likelier it is that you found the content meaningful and worth your time.[New data: Americans are abandoning wired home Internet]This week's News Feed tweak seems consistent with that approach. Although it doesn't single out clickbait by name, Facebook is saying it doesn't want publishers to basically take over the News Feed with their many, many attempts at attracting readers.Everyone\u2019s definition of clickbait is a little different. Here\u2019s how The Washington Post\u2019s executive editor, Marty Baron, described it to New York Magazine:The way I would define it is, it has a headline that tries to trick you to read the story and when you get to the story there\u2019s nothing of any substance.Of course, many substantive news stories now are written with webby, social-media-friendly headlines, too. That\u2019s by design, in a world where even actual news is forced to compete with cat listicles and Disney-princess personality quizzes.The results are clear: Clicky headlines attract readers.

The AHA group focused on decreasing their daily calorie intake in order to lose weight, and they were provided with goals to limit saturated fat. The fiber group was simply asked to eat more foods rich in fiber, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, to reach a quota of at least 30 grams of fiber per day. Neither group was told to change their exercise habits.After a year, both groups lost about the same amount of weight. Even more surprisingly, the people in the study also showed similar drops in cholesterol levels, blood pressure, blood sugar and inflammation. \"By changing one thing, people in the fiber group were able to improve their diet and lose weight and improve their overall markers for metabolic syndrome,\" says study author Dr. Yunsheng Ma.While he\u2019s not yet ready to say that people at risk of developing diabetes should ditch the AHA diet and focus just on eating more fiber, Ma's study does suggest an alternative way of getting healthier. \"I think we have to change the paradigm about recommendations,\" he says. \"Telling people to reduce this or reduce that is just too hard to do.\"Ma notes that while dietary guidelines to lower the risk of various diseases have been around for decades, obesity, heart problems and diabetes remain the most common conditions affecting Americans. \"Very few people reach the goals that are recommended,\" he says. Asking them to focus on eating more of a certain food\u2014rather than telling them what not to eat\u2014may help people to think more positively about changes in their diet, and make the goals more achievable.

But little did we know that Nintendo may be moving to a strategy that could allow for one of their largest libraries yet, and I have a good idea of what we could see the first year. When it all comes together, you\u2019ll be saying \"The NX will have how many games!!?\"Combining Handheld and Console DevelopmentSo how is Nintendo going to make all these new games? Well, it\u2019s due to an interesting internal change with how Nintendo makes games.In early 2016, Nintendo told business newspaper Nikkei that the company had combined their console and handheld development. While this change appears to be a change in hardware development, the article notes \"Nintendo is hoping the move will encourage further connectivity between console and portable devices, including the implementation of handheld devices as console controllers, and game data sharing so players can continue playing their console game on their handheld when away from the couch.\" Additionally, The Wall Street Journal reported that the system may very well be a hybrid citing development insiders (who had received development kits). Specifically, they state \"People familiar with the development plans said Nintendo would likely include both a console and at least one mobile unit that could either be used in conjunction with the console or taken on the road for separate use.\" Based on this, it looks very likely that the Nintendo NX could have combined console and handheld game development.Combining handheld and console development makes sense as the 8th Generation has been plagued with software droughts for Nintendo. As Satoru Iwata stated during a financial briefing \"Wii U has lost momentum due to the release pace of software titles after the launch period.\" While Nintendo had a good amount of games planned for 2013, the majority of them didn\u2019t launch until later in the year . Of course, it doesn\u2019t help that those games didn\u2019t get much of a foothold. As a result, Wii U sales went from 3.45 million in the 2012 fiscal year to 2.72 million in the 2013 fiscal year.Moreover, Nintendo has been making the same game over and over. There is a Mario Kart for the Wii U and 3DS. There is a New Super Mario Bros for the Wii U and 3DS. There is Smash Bros for Wii U and 3DS. Most of Nintendo\u2019s efficiency has been wasted on making a version for each console. Yet if they don\u2019t do this, some series get left out in the cold. For example, there was a traditional Animal Crossing game for the 3DS, but not for the WIi U.Having two system that both need games has stretched Nintendo thin. Nintendo was able to produce a plethora of games with the Wii because it didn\u2019t follow the HD trend of its competitors. With the Wii U, Nintendo struggled makings HD games with Shigeru Miyamoto stating \"We may have underestimated the scale of this change and as a result, the overall software development took more time than originally anticipated just as we tried to polish the software at the completion phase of development... \". Now, Nintendo can have a tidal wave of software titles right out of the gate. As Sean Malstrom states on his blog \"...instead of two pipelines to make games, there will be only one big pipeline. NX could have double or triple the first party software that the Wii U had. This is necessary for NX to go anywhere.\" If Nintendo\u2019s strategy is to really focus on one system, then that system could have a ton of games.How Many Games Will There Be?So that brings us to the ultimate question: Just how many games will the NX have??To answer this, I took a look back at the last 5 years from 2011 to 2015 to see how many games Nintendo and their internal development teams (Intelligent Systems, NdCube, Retro Studios and Monolith Studios) had created. These years were chosen as they would be the best representative for the NX because the NX will most likely be an HD system and the Wii was made to be a weaker system compared to Nintendo\u2019s rivals. Also, these are the most recent years and should be more representative of current game development cycles. I took a few other assumptions into account as well:I included the Legend of Zelda remakes on the 3DS. Although Grezzo was behind them, Nintendo still assisted in development of them. See here and here .Although Monolith worked on Project X Zone, I didn\u2019t include that title or its sequel in this list.This list does not include Super Smash Bros for Wii U and 3DS , Kid Icarus Uprising , and Pokemon games.It does not include games made by second-party developers, such as Next Level Games and HAL Laboratories.This list only includes full retail games.The data is based on Japanese release dates.Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Total # of games 9 7 8 5 11 40Games included above2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Mario Kart 7 Animal Crossing: New Leaf Fire Emblem Awakening Legend of Zelda: Link Between Worlds Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer Nintendogs + Cats Brain Age: Concentration Training Tomodachi Life Mario Party Island Tour Codename: S.T.E.A.M.

The variance (standard deviation) is approximately 2, meaning a year could have upwards of 10 games.[1]Based on this information, it\u2019s safe to say that the NX will have about 8 games throughout 2017. Most likely, the system will have 3-4 games available immediately at launch, another 3 to 4 titles released towards the end of the year. That said 2017 could have more games since new Nintendo games in 2016 are few and far between. The only games coming out during 2016 from Nintendo and its internal developers are Starfox Zero and Starfox Guard, Mario Party Star Rush, and Paper Mario Color Splash. As such, it\u2019s very possible that 2017 could have upwards of 10 games coming from Nintendo as they gear up for the launch of the NX. In a Investor Q&A, Kimishima stated \"One of the reasons for choosing the launch timing that we did is so that the software lineup will be ready in time for the hardware launch.\" Interestingly, Kimishima mentions \"software library\" implying Nintendo is gearing up a software library. Given the assessment above, Nintendo could have a plenty of titles ready and the delay could very well be to polish titles and line up the library to avoid software droughts.In total, Nintendo had 39 games during the 5 year period, so whythe heck did the Wii U and 3DS have such software droughts? With a game released every month or two, you\u2019d think the Wii U would have had plenty of games (especially as this list excludes some games). The problem was two fold. First, game development comes in cycles. 2012 and 2014 were very light on games where as 2013 and 2011 had plenty of games. A game takes about two to three years to complete, so there will be dry years. So 2014, for instance, only had two Wii U games: Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze and Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker. The second issue, as mentioned above, was that Nintendo had to make games for two seperate system. Even worse is that, in order to maximize the selling power of their best franchises, like Super Smash Bros, Mario Kart, and of course Super Mario, Nintendo had to develop a title for both their handheld and console. As a result, Nintendo can\u2019t give attention to their smaller series. Did you ever wonder why Nintendo isn\u2019t making more F-Zero titles? Well, they have to make two Mario Kart games. There just isn\u2019t enough time.Developing on a single system is a win/win for Nintendo. In the weak years (like 2012 and 2014 above), the drought will be alleviated by second-party titles and, hopefully, third-party titles. Although 2014 was a light year for Nintendo, it saw the release of Super Smash Bros for Wii U and 3DS, Pokemon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, Hyrule Warriors, Kirby Triple Deluxe, Mario Golf World Tour, and Pokemon Art Academy. On the other hand, there is a torrent of new software in the strong years (like 2013 and 2015). Before even considering new second-party titles, 2013 and 2015 had eight and eleven titles, respectively. \"But wasn\u2019t 2013 a bad year for Nintendo?\" It was, and some of Nintendo\u2019s sleeper hits for that year actually appeared on the 3DS: Fire Emblem Awakening and Tomodachi Life. Even though the goal was to bulk up the Wii U\u2019s library, Nintendo still had to work on the 3DS as well. Even worse is that both of these titles were released during the first half of 2013 when the Wii U\u2019s drought was at its worse. Although 2015 saw a lot of titles as well, only five of the eleven titles were released on the Wii U. Ultimately, the biggest problem with trying to support two systems is that one flourishes while the other struggles.What Games Will Be On the Nintendo NX?Once we think about how many games are available on the system, we naturally think about what those titles will be. So far, the only game confirmed for the NX will be The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Beyond that, it\u2019s all speculation, but we have some good guesses. Miyamoto has confirmed that Pikmin 4 is nearing the end of development. There have also been a rumors from every corner of the internet suggestion ports of Wii U games, such as Super Smash Bros, will come to the NX. I have also written on why I believe the next Smash will come sooner rather than later.Beyond that, Mario Kart is a very real possibility. Mario Kart games come out roughly every two to three years, and the Mario Kart 8 came out two years ago. Retro Studios has also been working on a new game. What that title is is anyone\u2019 guess. Will it be a new series? Metroid? Or perhaps they will tackle another Nintendo IP the company hasn\u2019t touched, such as F-Zero. All of these could be real possibilities. If you want to know more, check out Nantendo\u2019s Road to the NX. It remains ones of the best assessments of Nintendo internal development teams.ClosingNintendo executives have routinely discussed the fact that the NX is a system with a new concept. Based on the rumblings we\u2019ve gotten from Nintendo, it could very well be a combined handheld and console system. If that is true, we could see a huge stream of Nintendo games released for the system, approximately 8 a year (not including second-party titles). Time will only tell what the NX will really be, but needless to say, there is a plenty to be excited about.[1] \u2013 Actual standard deviation was 2.24Like this: Like Loading...", "answers": {"answer_start": [11092], "text": ["8 a year"]}, "id": "4t6h2t"}, {"question": "Southern city has change of heart about homeless", "context": "Columbia, South Carolina has decided to rescind its controversial decision to criminalize homelessness after facing major backlash from police, city workers and advocates.Columbia\u2019s city council decided on Tuesday to reverse its unanimous vote that would have given homeless people the choice to either go to a remote shelter or get arrested, according to the Free Times. The council apologized, backtracked on its decision and said it would give homeless people the option to go to the shelter, but would not force them to.\"I will take responsibility for that getting into the public discourse,\" Councilman Cameron Runyan said on Tuesday about his suggestion to force homeless people into confinement, according to the Free Times. \"That is not the desire...We are not going to forcibly confine anyone.\"Runyan\u2019s softer stance is a far cry from his stern Aug. 13 declaration.Last month, after bemoaning the fact that Columbia\u2019s Downtown area had become a \"magnet for homeless people,\" the council decided that it would make loitering and panhandling in the area illegal and it would make homeless people go to a 240-person bed shelter or go to prison. The measure would have required additional police to round up homeless people and to stand guard at the facility to make sure that no one left without permission.But even the members of the law enforcement who would have been needed to carry out the plan would not get on board.\"Homelessness is not a crime,\" Interim Police Chief Ruben Santiago told The State.\"We can\u2019t just take people to somewhere they don\u2019t want to go. I can\u2019t do that. I won\u2019t do that.\"After paying heed to the concerns of those who opposed the plan, the city council has revamped the approach to putting an end to homelessness.The city will dispense vans that will take people on the streets to the shelter, if they choose to go, and they will be able to stay there for a week before getting transferred to a more stable program that addresses their specific needs.The city will also install public bathrooms and garbage cans and will educate people about the city\u2019s loitering and panhandling policies by putting up explicit signs, according to the Free Times.But the city council hasn\u2019t smoothed out all of the program's kinks.Runyan suggested using the homeless people\u2019s food stamps, Social Security checks and other benefits to help pay to run the shelter, but some aren\u2019t sure if that is legal. The shelter, which is poised to open at the end of the month, also doesn\u2019t have kitchen facilities, so it\u2019s still unclear how it will provide food to homeless people.Still, advocates felt bolstered by the council\u2019s willingness to compromise.\"The city of Columbia, Christ Central Ministries and service providers recognize that meeting the challenge of homelessness and poverty requires a community response and that this is a \u2018we\u2019 challenge, not a \u2018them\u2019 challenge,\" Mayor Steve Benjamin said, according to the State, \"and never an effort to deprive any individuals of civil liberties or to criminalize poverty.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [0], "text": ["Columbia"]}, "id": "375997294484541440"}, {"question": "M&amp;Ms new flavor is so obviously right it'll make you wonder why it didn't already exist", "context": "The New M&Ms Flavor Is So Obviously Right You'll Wonder Why It Didn't Happen SoonerThe makers of America's most iconic candy are bucking the pumpkin spice fall trend in favor of something more traditional: caramel and chocolate.In a tweet posted on Tuesday morning, the M&M brand revealed that its newest flavor would be a caramel and chocolate candy, clocking in at 190 calories per serving.

And it\u2019s going to do so in an innovative way.While Oregon, California, West Virginia and Vermont have each passed laws through their state legislatures enacting automatic voter registration, the process in Connecticut was initiated by state agencies. The office of Connecticut Secretary of the State Denise Merrill (D) signed an administrative agreement with the state Department of Motor Vehicles to automatically register eligible voters by August 2018.The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires states to give eligible voters the opportunity to register to vote when they renew their driver\u2019s license or state identification card, or when they acquire a new one, at the DMV. Connecticut says it will transition to a system where eligible voters are registered automatically when they interact with the DMV. The state says up to 400,000 new voters could be registered through this process once the two agencies hammer out the details.\"It just makes sense that people shouldn't have to go to two different places to do a state service. If you\u2019re 18 and a citizen, it\u2019s your right to vote,\" Merrill told The Huffington Post Tuesday. \"This makes interacting with the state government easier, for everyone.\"A memorandum of understanding between Merrill\u2019s office and the DMV notes that the program may need funding from the state legislature. In other words, the program isn\u2019t entirely circumventing Connecticut's General Assembly, where Democrats control both chambers. An automatic registration bill failed to pass out of the legislature in the latest session.Shifting the burden of registration from the voter to the state is a popular concept among progressives -- including President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) -- but it turned into a bipartisan cause in West Virginia, which in March became the first state with a GOP-controlled legislature to pass an automatic voter registration bill. Voting rights advocates say automatic registration can save money for states and is more secure than traditional methods, especially in states that don't offer online registration: State agencies transfer data on eligible voters between them, rather than entering data from paper registration forms, which can lead to errors.Still, J.R. Romano, the chairman of the Connecticut Republican Party, questioned whether the agencies will be able to implement automatic voter registration properly. He pointed out that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the Connecticut DMV for failing to comply with the NVRA.\"I\u2019m all for voter participation,\" Romano told HuffPost. \"The issue is that the current leadership in this state is more focused on trying to grab positive headlines versus actually accomplishing anything.\"\"I appreciate the attempt, but everything they have attempted to do is an utter failure,\" he went on. \"We do have undocumented people with licenses, so if they\u2019re using the DMV, how are they going to ensure that actual citizens are registering to vote?\"Since the DMV is already overhauling its registration system in response to the threat of a lawsuit from the DOJ, Merrill argued that now is the perfect time to initiate automatic voter registration. Indeed, the effort may convince the DOJ that a lawsuit against the state isn\u2019t necessary.\"I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate, but certainly Connecticut has been in the forefront of making voter registration easier, more efficient,\" Merrill said. \"I think that if we can show that these measures that we are taking will improve our performance, it may help.\"In Oregon, the state automatically registers eligible voters who visit the DMV by sending them a postcard that offers them the choice to either opt out or register with a particular party. If an eligible voter does not return the postcard, he or she is registered as an unaffiliated voter. The program has already been a huge success: More than 51,000 Oregonians have been added to the voter rolls through automatic voter registration since it launched in January. That's three times as many new registrations compared to the prior rate received through the DMV in the last presidential election.Connecticut is considering various possibilities for how to allow eligible voters to opt out of registration if they prefer.

They are more likely than their college-educated counterparts, for example, to be unemployed, unmarried or suffering from poor health.\"This is a story of the collapse of the white working class,\" Deaton said in an interview. \"The labor market has very much turned against them.\"Those dynamics helped fuel the rise of President Donald Trump, who won widespread support among whites with only a high school diploma. Yet Deaton said his policies are unlikely to reverse these trends, particularly the health care legislation now before the House that Trump is championing. That bill would lead to higher premiums for older Americans, the Congressional Budget Office has found.\"The policies that you see, seem almost perfectly designed to hurt the very people who voted for him,\" Deaton said.Case and Deaton\u2019s paper, issued by the Brookings Institution, follows up on research they released in 2015 that first documented a sharp increase in mortality among middle-aged whites.Since 1999, white men and women ages 45 through 54 have endured a sharp increase in \"deaths of despair,\" Case and Deaton found in their earlier work. These include suicides, drug overdoses, and alcohol-related deaths such as liver failure.In the paper released Thursday, Case and Deaton draw a clearer relationship between rising death rates and changes in the job market since the 1970s. They find that men without college degrees are less likely to receive rising incomes over time, a trend \"consistent with men moving to lower and lower skilled jobs.\"Other research has found that Americans with only high school diplomas are less likely to get married or purchase a home and more likely to get divorced if they do marry.\"It\u2019s not just their careers that have gone down the tubes, but their marriage prospects, their ability to raise children,\" said Deaton, who won the Nobel prize in economics in 2015 for his long-standing work on solutions to poverty. \"That\u2019s the kind of thing that can lead people to despair.\"The issues identified by Case and Deaton are likely contributing to a slight reversal in a decades-long trend of improving life-expectancy data. It\u2019s not entirely clear why these trends have affected whites much more than they have African-Americans or Hispanics, whose death rates are improving.Case and Deaton note that many Hispanics are \"markedly better off\" than parents or grandparents who were born abroad, enabling a greater sense of optimism. African-Americans, they add, may have become more resilient to economic challenges given their long-standing disadvantages in the job market.Other researchers have said that whites may have an easier time obtaining painkillers that are behind an epidemic of drug overdoses.The data is clear, though: In 1999, the death rate for high school-educated whites ages 50 through 54 was 30 percent lower than the death rate for all African-Americans in that age group. By 2015, it was 30 percent higher.The educational split is also growing. Even while the death rate for whites without a college degree is rising, the rate for whites who are college graduates is falling, Case and Deaton found.The trends cut across diverse regions of the country, the researchers found. While the worst-hit spots include Appalachian states such as West Virginia and Kentucky, they also include such areas as Maine, Baltimore and eastern Washington state. The patterns are evident in rural sections and smaller cities as well as in some large metro areas, the research found.Americans with less education are also faring much worse when compared with adults in other countries, Case and Deaton concluded. Death rates in Europe for people with limited education are falling \u2014 and in most countries, they\u2019re falling faster than death rates for those with more education.For those reasons, Case and Deaton discount the notion that government disability benefit programs are responsible for some of these problems by enabling more Americans to stop working. Social welfare programs in Europe are typically more generous yet haven\u2019t caused a rise in death rates.Given the long-running nature of these trends, many of which stem from the 1970s, reversing them could take years, Case and Deaton write. But there are immediate steps that could be taken, Deaton said in the interview. Routine prescriptions for opioids should be cut back.And, \"Europe has a much better safety net than we do, and they\u2019re not seeing the same sort of problems as we are,\" he said.", "answers": {"answer_start": [183], "text": ["deaths of despair"]}, "id": "845301549102501888"}, {"question": "Have You Woken Up At Night And Were Unable To Move And Felt Paralyzed. It Means This", "context": "The average person sleeps for around eight hours a day. Over a lifetime this amounts to spending about one third of life asleep. It\u2019s common knowledge that a good nights rest is vitally important for maintaining health and balance, both mentally and physically.However, for some people a good night\u2019s sleep is hard to come by, or it ends up being ruined, by a strange phenomenon that is called sleep paralysis.It happens when your mind wakes up before your body ever gets a chance to. You can breathe normally, you can see and understand everything around you, but you can\u2019t move a muscle no matter how hard you try. The feelings that run through your mind when sleep paralysis occurs are overwhelming and the whole experience can be summed up as terrifying. Many people report that right before waking they hear a loud bang or waves crashing in their head which suddenly jars them awake. Others report that they do in fact have difficulty breathing and that it feels as if someone were choking them. These moments can last from a few seconds to several minutes or longer and most commonly show up initially during one\u2019s teenage years.The sensation of waking up and not being able to move is thought to affect less than 8% of the general population. There are no serious risks attributed to sleep paralysis on its own, medically speaking, rather the mental and physical damage may occur in the long run. While there may be genetic factors that contribute to it, the main causes are thought to be a lack of sleep, schedule changes, and sleeping on ones back. Back in earlier times it used to be thought that demons or evil forces were behind the strange phenomenon and it\u2019s easy to see why. Here are 8 terrifying facts about it:1) No one knows for sure what causes it- Science and researchers have yet to find a definitive cause or explanation as to what may trigger it. It has been a mystery for thousands of years and to this day it remains one.2) It feels like you\u2019re dead- Many people equate the experience of waking up and being unable to move, while fully mentally awake, to feeling like they\u2019re dead. Basically, it\u2019s a type of out of body experience that you never want to experience.3) It can happen when you\u2019re trying to fall asleep- It doesn\u2019t only occur when you wake up. It can occur at two points in the sleep cycle when your body transitions between going into, and coming out of, the REM (deep sleep) stage.4) If you suffer from a lack of sleep it\u2019s more likely to happen to you- Studies have indicated that individuals who suffer from chronic sleep issues, and who routinely don\u2019t get enough sleep, are more likely to have an episode of sleep paralysis than their well-rested counterparts.5) Your nightmare may continue- A lot of people have reported that they feel like they\u2019re in a living nightmare even after they wake up because they open their eyes and see hallucinations. They are mentally alert and know they are awake, but their minds and eyes see things that aren\u2019t there, and it\u2019s all too freakishly real.6) It can feel like a demon is sitting on your chest- A common description given of what it feels like is that there is something heavy and bothersome weighing on your chest. Yikes!7) There is no way to wake your body up- You literally have to wait for your body to snap out if it. No cough or blink will wake you, contrary to some beliefs.8) It can happen to anybody\u2013 You may have already experienced it at some point in your life, not everyone is aware that it happened, and practically everyone will go through it at least once over the course of their lifetime.", "answers": {"answer_start": [394], "text": ["sleep paralysis"]}, "id": "50bsxo"}, {"question": "Two Words I'll Never Say To My Daughter Again", "context": "When you're living a distracted life, every minute must be accounted for. You feel like you must be checking something off the list, staring at a screen, or rushing off to the next destination. And no matter how many ways you divide your time and attention, no matter how many duties you try and multi-task, there's never enough time in a day to ever catch up.That was my life for two frantic years. My thoughts and actions were controlled by electronic notifications, ring tones, and jam-packed agendas. And although every fiber of my inner drill sergeant wanted to be on time to every activity on my overcommitted schedule, I wasn't.You see, six years ago I was blessed with a laid-back, carefree, stop-and-smell-the roses type of child.When I needed to be out the door, she was taking her sweet time picking out a purse and a glittery crown.When I needed to be somewhere five minutes ago, she insisted on buckling her stuffed animal into a car seat.When I needed to grab a quick lunch at Subway, she'd stop to speak to the elderly woman who looked like her grandma.When I had 30 minutes to get in a run, she wanted me to stop the stroller and pet every dog we passed.When I had a full agenda that started at 6:00 a.m., she asked to crack the eggs and stir them ever so gently.My carefree child was a gift to my Type A, task-driven nature --but I didn't see it. Oh no, when you live life distracted, you have tunnel vision -- only looking ahead to what's next on the agenda. And anything that cannot be checked off the list is a waste of time.Whenever my child caused me to deviate from my master schedule, I thought to myself, \"We don't have time for this.\" Consequently, the two words I most commonly spoke to my little lover of life were: \"Hurry up.\"I started my sentences with it.Hurry up, we're gonna be late.I ended sentences with it.We're going to miss everything if you don't hurry up.I started my day with it.Hurry up and eat your breakfast.Hurry up and get dressed.I ended my day with it.Hurry up and brush your teeth.Hurry up and get in bed.And although the words \"hurry up\" did little if nothing to increase my child's speed, I said them anyway. Maybe even more than the words, \"I love you.\"The truth hurts, but the truth heals... and brings me closer to the parent I want to be.Then one fateful day, things changed. We'd just picked my older daughter up from kindergarten and were getting out of the car. Not going fast enough for her liking, my older daughter said to her little sister, \"You are so slow.\" And when she crossed her arms and let out an exasperated sigh, I saw myself -- and it was a gut-wrenching sight.I was a bully who pushed and pressured and hurried a small child who simply wanted to enjoy life.My eyes were opened; I saw with clarity the damage my hurried existence was doing to both of my children.Although my voice trembled, I looked into my small child's eyes and said, \"I am so sorry I have been making you hurry. I love that you take your time, and I want to be more like you.\"Both my daughters looked equally surprised by my painful admission, but my younger daughter's face held the unmistakable glow of validation and acceptance.\"I promise to be more patient from now on,\" I said as I hugged my curly-haired child who was now beaming at her mother's newfound promise.It was pretty easy to banish \"hurry up\" from my vocabulary. What was not so easy was acquiring the patience to wait on my leisurely child. To help us both, I began giving her a little more time to prepare if we had to go somewhere. And sometimes, even then, we were still late. Those were the times I assured myself that I will be late only for a few years, if that, while she is young.When my daughter and I took walks or went to the store, I allowed her to set the pace. And when she stopped to admire something, I would push thoughts of my agenda out of my head and simply observe her. I witnessed expressions on her face that I'd never seen before. I studied dimples on her hands and the way her eyes crinkled up when she smiled. I saw the way other people responded to her stopping to take time to talk to them. I saw the way she spotted the interesting bugs and pretty flowers. She was a Noticer, and I quickly learned that The Noticers of the world are rare and beautiful gifts. That's when I finally realized she was a gift to my frenzied soul.My promise to slow down was made almost three years ago, at the same time I began my journey to let go of daily distraction and grasp what matters in life. And living at a slower pace still takes a concerted effort. My younger daughter is my living reminder of why I must keep trying. In fact, the other day, she reminded me once again.The two of us had taken a bike ride to a sno-cone shack while on vacation. After purchasing a cool treat for my daughter, she sat down at a picnic table delightedly admiring the icy tower she held in her hand.Suddenly a look of worry came across her face. \"Do I have to rush, Mama?\"I could have cried. Perhaps the scars of a hurried life don't ever completely disappear, I thought sadly.As my child looked up at me waiting to know if she could take her time, I knew I had a choice. I could sit there in sorrow thinking about the number of times I rushed my child through life... or I could celebrate the fact that today I'm trying to do thing differently.I chose to live in today.\"You don't have to rush. Just take your time,\" I said gently. Her whole face instantly brightened and her shoulders relaxed.And so we sat side-by-side talking about things that ukulele-playing-6-year-olds talk about. There were even moments when we sat in silence just smiling at each other and admiring the sights and sounds around us.I thought my child was going to eat the whole darn thing -- but when she got to the last bite, she held out a spoonful of ice crystals and sweet juice for me. \"I saved the last bite for you, Mama,\" my daughter said proudly.As I let the icy goodness quench my thirst, I realized I just got the deal of a lifetime.I gave my child a little time... and in return, she gave me her last bite and reminded me that things taste sweeter and love comes easier when you stop rushing through life.Whether it's ...Sno-cone eatingFlower pickingSeatbelt bucklingEgg crackingSeashell findingLadybug watchingSidewalk strollingI will not say, \"We don't have time for this.\" Because that is basically saying, \"We don't have time to live.\"Pausing to delight in the simple joys of everyday life is the only way to truly live.(Trust me, I learned from the world's leading expert on joyful living.)", "answers": {"answer_start": [1886], "text": ["hurry up"]}, "id": "170016066732231_280999748967195"}, {"question": "The most overlooked aspect of decorating a living room", "context": "You agonized for hours over the perfect stain color for your hardwood floors and the exact right shade of \"greige\" to paint your walls.

It said on Thursday it intends to sell 70 million shares between $17 and $20 apiece, raking in up to $1.4 billion for the company.If underwriters choose to sell an additional allotment of 10.5 million shares, the offer could raise as much as $1.6 billion.Twitter's offering will be the most high-profile Internet IPO since Facebook's May 2012 debut, when the social network giant's shares fell below their offering price and did not recover until a year later. Still, the modest pricing doesn't obscure questions about Twitter's profitability.\"The fact that the valuation is lower than expectations, I think was smart by the underwriters. I think it will help the pop,\" said Michael Yoshikami of Destinational Weath Management.\"But in the end, even for $11 billion, the question is can they come up with earnings to substantiate that number? And it's unclear that they're going to be able to do that.\"At a roughly $11 billion valuation, Twitter would be worth more than Yelp Inc and AOL Inc combined, but only a fraction of tech giants like Google Inc and Apple Inc, worth $342 billion and $483 billion respectively. Facebook's market value is now $128 billion.ROADSHOW RECKONINGTwitter and its underwriters begin a two-week road show to woo investors next Monday in New York, with stops in Boston and the mid-Atlantic region before touching down in Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Denver, according to a source familiar with the offering.\"They're trying to price this for a very strong IPO, ideally creating the conditions for a solid after-market,\" said Pivotal Research Group's Brian Wieser, who valued the company at $19 billion.The company could choose to raise the price of the offering during that period as it gauges interest. Twitter is expected to set a final price on Nov. 6, according to a document reviewed by Reuters, suggesting that the stock could begin trading as early as Nov. 7.Sam Hamadeh of PrivCo, a private company research firm, said Twitter could raise the price range and also the amount of shares being sold. But, he added: \"Raising both the price and the size was Facebook's fatal mistake.\"Twitter's debut will cap seven years of explosive growth for an online messaging service that counts heads of state and major celebrities among its 230 million active users - but still operates at a loss.Twitter will sell roughly 13 percent of the company in the IPO and will have 544,696,816 shares outstanding after the offering. That figure could rise given the exercising of options, restricted stock units and the issuance of shares for compensation after the IPO.The company plans to list its stock under the \"TWTR\" symbol on the New York Stock Exchange.Among the biggest Twitter shareholders selling in the offering is Rizvi Traverse, a fund managed by secretive Connecticut-based investor Suhail Rizvi, who has quietly amassed a 17.9 percent stake in Twitter with the help of Silicon Valley investor Chris Sacca.Rizvi's stake will fall to 15.6 percent of total shares outstanding after the sale. JP Morgan Chase, which obtained Twitter shares through Rizvi and Sacca, will see its stake fall to 9 percent from 10.3 percent.Twitter co-founder Evan Williams, the largest individual shareholder, will reduce his stake to 10.4 percent from 12 percent, while Chief Executive Dick Costolo will emerge with a 1.4 percent stake, compared with 1.6 percent currently.Co-founder Jack Dorsey will also sell shares, as will early venture capital investors Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures and Benchmark Capital.FRACTURED OWNERSHIPBecause many early shareholders, including Williams, previously sold parts of their stake to other investors like Rizvi, Twitter's relatively fractured ownership structure looks markedly different from the likes of Facebook and other tech companies dominated by their founders.When Facebook went public last year, founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg kept 57 percent of the company's voting shares, thanks to a scheme that gave him twice the voting power of ordinary shareholders.Following Twitter's IPO, Costolo will be under pressure to improve its money-making ability. The eight-year-old company more than doubled its third-quarter revenue to $168.6 million, but net losses widened to $64.6 million in the September quarter, it disclosed in a filing earlier this month.This month, Twitter secured a $1 billion credit line from its underwriters including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank.In recent months the company has aggressively introduced a number of new advertising products, including packages with broadcasters CBS and ESPN that show ads on TV and Twitter simultaneously for the fall TV season.Twitter has also sought to deepen its relationships with news organizations, which provide much of the content shared on the network.

Those hiccups are pretty annoying, maybe a little embarrassing, but hey, we're not judging. They're also usually harmless.Usually. Hiccups may also be a sign you're having a stroke.Before you freak: We're not talking about those same beer-chugging hiccups, but a painful, unrelenting, severe case of the hiccups that comes on out of nowhere, says neurologist Diana Greene-Chandos, MD, director of neuroscience critical care at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center. These are hiccups so bad you just might bring yourself to the emergency room.When they truly are a sign of a stroke, if you're paying really close attention to your body, you might also notice chest pain, all-over numbness, or a bit of blurred vision, but, Greene-Chandos says, the hiccups are often so severe, those other symptoms fly under the radar.Crazy, right? In fact, no one really knows about this whole hiccup thing. Greene-Chandos's team recently polled 1,000 women and found just 10 percent knew hiccups can be a sign of stroke. (For more surprising health tips, get a free trial of Prevention + 12 bonus gifts here!)That's bad news, especially since doctors probably aren't in the know, either. When a woman shows up at the ER with uncontrollable hiccups and feels a little tingly, most hospital staffers don't immediately think stroke, Greene-Chandos says. But every minute counts: Clot-busting meds work best when they're administered within three hours. The sooner a woman (and her doctors!) can identify these female-specific signs, the better outcome she's likely to have. Currently, stroke is the No. 5 cause of death in the US, according to the CDC, killing nearly 130,000 Americans each year.Speaking of every minute counting: You've probably heard of F.A.S.T. as it applies to stroke symptoms. Quick refresher: It stands for face drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty (the most common signs someone's having a stroke), time to call 911 -- and it definitely still applies to women. Today, commit a few others to memory: hiccups, chest pain, whole-body numbness, and headaches, a set of women-only symptoms for which there isn't a handy acronym -- yet.Hiccups are associated with a type of stroke that occurs in the back of the brain as opposed to the top, a type that is indeed more common in women. \"That probably has something to do with the hiccup component and how the strokes manifest themselves differently,\" Greene-Chandos says, but we don't entirely know what's going on.That doesn't mean hiccups shouldn't be on your radar, though. Sure, it could be terrible indigestion, she says, but tune in to what your body is telling you. If you notice some numbness, chest pain, or blurry vision along with those hiccups, don't brush them off. Women are all too likely to ignore signs of a stroke. \"Women don't think of it as a disease that involves them,\" Greene-Chandos says. But actually, 60 percent of deaths from stroke happen among women, she says. \"All my friends can tell you all about breast cancer, and it claims nowhere near as many lives.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [213], "text": ["having a stroke"]}, "id": "631563709236817920"}, {"question": "Why Viola Davis Wanted to Pepper Spray Jared Leto", "context": "Jared Leto may want to keep a safe distance from his Suicide Squad co-stars.It was previously believed that Viola Davis, who plays Amanda Waller in the supervillains superhero flick, didn't receive any of Leto's infamous gifts he sent to the cast during filming.Turns out she did receive a box of bullets.\"It was a little worrisome,\" Davis said. \"It made you a little bit nervous and I'm pretty tough.

That same day, Dorsey was also booked to speak at Techonomy Detroit, a spinoff of the startup-booster business conference founded by journalist David Kirkpatrick.Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert, Etsy CEO Chad Dickerson and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (the former chairman of Gateway) also took the stage at Techonomy to declare that tech industry entrepreneurs can accelerate the city's comeback. Twitter already opened a small office in Detroit last year, and a dozen startup companies (many bankrolled by Gilbert's venture fund) have rented office space downtown.Some critics question the idea that small startups like these can really drive a recovery in a once industrial city that still struggles with intense unemployment, not to mention its $18 billion debt. But Dorsey believes entrepreneurship -- both online and traditional -- is the best way to help neighborhoods and cities.Tuesday night's \"Let's Talk\" forum featured four Square-wielding local small business owners -- a jam-maker, a boutique owner, a letterpress studio owner and a cupcake mogul-in-the-making, all of them women.They're not the sort of entrepreneurs you'd necessarily expect to see sharing a stage with the chairman of Twitter. But Dorsey said the \"Let's Talk\" series, which also recently visited his hometown of St. Louis, Mo., along with Oakland and Stockton in California, looks for just these kinds of small business owners to spotlight.\"There's so much great energy in Silicon Valley and San Francisco around building a culture of mentorship and support for entrepreneurs,\" he said. \"We wanted to see if we could export that for every type of entrepreneur, not just tech entrepreneurs.\"Before the event began, Dorsey sat at a table in one of Pam Turkin's Just Baked cupcake shops in downtown Detroit. Turkin is a Square user who has recently seen sales of her gourmet treats crack the $3 million threshold, putting her among the top 2.6 percent of female business owners in the country, according to Count Me In, a nonprofit resource for women entrepreneurs.\"I spend a lot of time telling other women that they're able to take that risk,\" Turkin said. \"Just dive in, and if it doesn't work, move onto the next thing.\"Turkin said she's seen downtown Detroit's business district become more vibrant in the three years since she opened her first cupcake shop.\"I talk about the city a lot here, locally, because there's been such a stigma with moving downtown,\" she said. \"It's been amazing for us. There's a lot of action, and there's a lot of energy.\"Ultimately, the man who founded Twitter believes brick-and-mortar businesses like Turkin's will always be necessary, and especially in cities like Detroit.\"No matter how much of our life moves online or to technology, we're always going to appreciate the neighborhood places that we go to and meet our friends,\" Dorsey said.

Sprint has even started using Paul Marcarelli, the man who asked \"can you hear me now?\" for Verizon for years, in its latest commercials.

In fact, the survey of 8,600 consumers showed that value plays a big role in keeping people happy.Which carriers have the happiest customers?Market Force asked survey participants to rate their satisfaction with their primary wireless carrier and its services, as well as their likelihood to refer that brand to others. Those results were averaged to create what the research company calls the \"Composite Loyalty Index.\"The survey showed that of the four major full-service carriers, T-Mobile had the highest score, just beating second-place Verizon. And, as you might expect, T-Mobile CEO John Legere took to social media to celebrate the win tweeting \"No surprise here...guess who's at the top. The #uncarrier. #WeWontStop.\"Perhaps most interestingly the research found that satisfaction levels are actually higher among people using non-contract carriers. In that category Consumer Cellular came in first followed by Cricket, StraightTalk, Metro PCS, Boost Mobile, TracFone, Virgin Mobile and U.S. Cellular.Why are non-contract companies better-liked?It's important to note that many of the major non-contract brands are actually owned by the four major carriers. AT&T owns Cricket and Consumer Cellular operates on its network. T-Mobile owns Metro PCS while Sprint owns Boost Mobile. Market Force found that 62% of wireless customers have a contract, 33% do not,and 5% use pre-paid phones.\"We were intrigued to find that, for the most part, consumers are more delighted with non-contract wireless providers than with traditional, full-service carriers,\" said Market Force Chief Strategy Officer Cheryl Flink. \"This could be attributed to the fact that wireless users believe non-contract carriers provide a better perceived value to their customers based on factors like price, coverage, and flexibility to change plans.\"What sets the full-service carriers apart?Market Force found that T-Mobile customer are happiest with the value offered by the company as well as ease of changing plans and access to new cell phone technologies. The survey showed that those factors could outweigh the categories generally associated with network quality because T-Mobile actually came in last for frequency of dropped calls.Verizon easily led the network coverage category and Sprint came in at or near the bottom for every category.These results show that good customer service, clear plans, and decent pricing can cover up for deficiencies in other areas. Consumers don't all forgive T-Mobile for not having as good a network as Verizon, but enough do to put it at the top of the overall rankings.

(Spoiler alert: the driver dies too).Considering how important tires are, they aren\u2019t given nearly enough credit in the media or in car-guy circles. Sure, every racer talks about tires, and a lot of canyon warriors will sit on top of the snake talking setup, but on the internet and in casual conversation with casual enthusiasts, tires are a dull topic. You certainly can\u2019t brag about them on a forum the way you can with your upgraded turbo and fresh dyno chart. You have to go into the Grassroots Motorsports catalog, or to a very specific sub-genre to see a tire comparison test for your desired application, so most people just end up reading reviews on TireRack.Tires are a dull topic even when we\u2019re actively shopping for tires. They have insanely complicated naming schemes like GoodRubber GoodGripper Pro XGV25, which makes them even harder to discuss than Infiniti\u2019s current lineup. In all seriousness, I have a set of tires on my Mustang at the moment called \"Continental ContiForce Contact.\" That\u2019s a real name under which a real set of tires is marketed. Most people don\u2019t have the luxury of actually testing tires before they buy either, making decisions based on either anecdotal evidence, a roll of the dice, budget, or a combination of the three.Nevertheless, the four small patches of rubber connecting your two-ton manslaughter machine to your city\u2019s lowest-priced asphalt are, if you ask me, the best way to improve your car, or, the quickest way to fuck it up, crash, and even die. Even if you should know better. And I\u2019m going to give you one piece of advice\u2014advice I learned the hard way, but not as hard as my friends Paul Walker\u2014who would have celebrated his 43rd birthday this week\u2014and Roger Rodas did.In November of 2012, I entered my modified C5 Corvette in the \"Optima Batteries Ultimate Street Car Invitational,\" a multi-discipline driving event held the day after SEMA ends in Las Vegas.[Disclaimer: I have done promotional work at events for Optima Batteries unrelated to this event or to my column at The Drive.]I could not have been less prepared for this event if I had left the car\u2019s targa roof at home in the garage, which, by the way, I did. Think it never rains in Vegas? Never snows? Go there in a car without a roof. I guarantee both will happen.Though the car was, and is, in mostly good nick, with, at the time, around 25,000 miles on it. The engine makes 400 horsepower to the wheels with some mild bolt-on upgrades, and it has a Stoptech Big Brake kit, Pfadt coilover suspension, racing seats, harnesses, and more. All of it worked.The bad news? It also had six-year old Goodyear F1 Assymetric tires on it. They had less than 5,000 miles on them, so they looked nearly new. But looking new and gripping like new are two different propositions entirely.A tire, for those as unfamiliar with this concept as I was back then, does two things: it sticks to the road by nature of its rubber chemical compound, and it disperses water using the tread pattern cut into the tire.On a street tire, most people will notice their tread has worn down after several thousand miles of use and decide it\u2019s time to get new tires. If it rains, the worn tread won\u2019t disperse water as well and you will have poor wet-weather performance, and a tendency towards hydroplaning. With cars driven frequently, you will wear out your tread before you age-out your rubber, which is the problem I want to address.With collector cars, especially cars driven less than a few thousand miles a year, the problem is that while your tread may look good, the rubber is old and dry, and simply will not work properly. The chemical compounds in your tires will degrade over time, significantly reducing your available grip, or worse, blowing out a sidewall under load.With sport tires, colder weather and harsh weather will exacerbate this. In general, five years from date of manufacture (stamped on the tire) is about as old as you ever want to go in a car you plan to drive quickly.

He believes she suffered from an ailment that probably would not have been diagnosed, an extremely common health problem in her time that is rare today.After researching his new book and publishing a study in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, Sotos wants to end the ailment argument once and for all.Sotos, who was a medical technical adviser for the TV show \"House M.D.,\" believes he has solved one of the great medical mysteries of American history.Mary Todd Lincoln, a paradoxBut before we share Sotos' professional medical opinion, you may be wondering why there is a debate about the health of a woman who hasn't been to the doctor in 150 years.When it comes to her health, biographer Jean Baker describes her as \"the reverse of Teflon.\"\"Every medical diagnosis has been postulated about her, it runs the gamut from Lyme disease to chronic fatigue to diabetes,\" said Baker, an award-winning historian at Goucher CollegeHistorians also often described Lincoln with a kind of misogynistic dismissiveness, Baker noted, chalking her symptoms up to \"hysterical\" female problems.Sexism in the historical record aside, Lincoln is difficult to pin down because she seems to have two distinctly different personalities.As a young woman, friends described her as having a \"natural kindness of heart.\" She was well-educated, intensely intellectual and a gifted conversationalist at parties. As a partner, she was ambitious and politically astute, guiding her famously devoted husband, Abraham Lincoln, to become not merely the president but one of American history's most important.But in the White House, she developed a bad rap for her terrible temper and sour disposition. Angry outbursts earned her the nickname \"the hellcat\" from the president's assistant private secretary. And, as one historian put it , regularly \"she indulged in her orgies of buying things,\" like some kind of Victorian Imelda Marcos.It's hard to blame anyone for needing at least a little retail therapy, if not becoming deeply depressed over her tragic public life.She lost not one but three sons in her lifetime. In the White House fishbowl, the press constantly hounded her, and vicious gossips mocked her unflattering gowns, portraying her as a Confederate spy or a Western hick.Her husband lived under constant threat, and she ultimately lost the love of her life when he was shot, sitting next to her, holding her hand in a theater as they watched a British farce about rube-ish Americans.Late in life, her remaining son had her forcibly committed to an asylum, a humiliation she endured for three months before friends could spring her.At her death, her doctor argued that society should not judge her harshly and chalked up her behavior to \"cerebral disease.\"But was it really mental illness that changed her personality so much?The medical recordNone of Lincoln's primary medical records exists today, with the exception of limited notes doctors kept when she was forcibly institutionalized. That's only four months of records.Without lab tests or DNA, which provides only limited detail, Sotos is left with about 100 historic sources, including 678 letters and photos from the time.In his book \"The Mary Lincoln Mind-Body Sourcebook,\" Sotos argues that that record is enough. For those who might question this practice -- and some scholars do take issue with any retrospective diagnosis of an historical figure -- Sotos writes, \"the amount of information in the historical record exceeds the amount a physician might collect in a 10-minute clinical visit -- a duration clearly sufficient to make many diagnosis.\"He argues that only one thing can account for the many disparate mental and physical symptoms he finds described in the letters.Sotos believes Lincoln suffered from pernicious anemia.The dreaded 'Downton Abbey' diseasePernicious anemia , which doctors sometimes call PA, has all but disappeared in modern life and from most modern medical literature.Only \"Downton Abbey\" fans may recognize the disease as (spoiler alert) London doctors inaccurately diagnosed Lord Merton with it, initially causing much consternation. PA was a death sentence in the early 20th century, when the show took place, and was among the most common reasons for people to be hospitalized.In Lincoln's time, it wasn't even a diagnosis. According to Sotos' research, PA was not known in English-language medical literature until 1874, eight years before Lincoln's death.Sotos argues that nearly all of Lincoln's symptoms fit the description of PA as it progresses, if left untreated.A severe vitamin B12 deficiency causes PA. Your body needs B12 to make red blood cells and nerves and to keep DNA functioning properly. People sometimes don't get enough because of their diet -- vegans are vulnerable -- or more often, the stomach wall stops making the chemical the body uses to absorb the vitamin from food.It was deadly because doctors didn't know what caused it. No treatment surfaced until 1926, when three doctors -- George Whipple, George Minot and William Murphy -- demonstrated that PA patients who ate a half-pound of raw liver daily could be cured. It was such a big medical advance that the trio won the Nobel Prize in 1934.When B12 was finally isolated in 1948, it enabled scientists to create a shot that people can get once a month and stay healthy.PA, a slowly progressive disease, can account for the otherwise seemingly unconnected symptoms throughout Lincoln's life that got worse as she aged, Sotos argues.Sotos lists Lincoln's symptoms over 30 years, which match PA symptoms , including a regular pallor to her skin, fever, headaches, gait problems, abnormal sensations as if she were being stuck by needles, soreness to her mouth, swelling, shortness of breath and resting tachycardia.Psychologically, she started to show signs of hypervigilance, delusions and hallucinations, but all with a kind of perceived clarity. B12 deficiency shrinks the brain, leading to a significant decline in cognitive function, paranoia and hallucinations.As she got older, the energetic woman who loved to read could no longer see well, and toward the end she became so weak and tired, she could barely move. Eventually, no longer able to speak, she communicated by blinking.At her death, she was diagnosed with \"a slight apoplexy,\" which seems to match the description of other PA deaths at the time, Sotos argues.So what now?Sotos hopes that this diagnosis will help future scholars reassess this \"notoriously difficult-to-understand partner to one of the most consequential figures in world history.\"Biographer Baker isn't totally sold. \"I think it is great that he walked out on this speculative length,\" she said. But she said Lincoln was a \"ball of fire,\" full of energy.However, as a progressive disease, PA may not sap someone's energy right away.Recently discovered letters suggest that Lincoln may have been taking too much chloral hydrate for sleep problems, which could account for some of her mental problems, Baker said.Baker has said some scholarship suggests that Lincoln's symptoms may have been related to spinal stenosis or diabetes. Sotos has argued that those diseases couldn't totally account for her mental problems, but PA can be the cause of both mental and physical symptoms.Ultimately, Baker said, with so many symptoms described in these letters as being \"vague,\" they may be a good fit for many diagnosis.Sotos is convinced and says the diagnosis has changed his own opinion of Lincoln.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.He said he came across the first lady as he put together a book , \"The Physical Lincoln,\" a medical analysis of Abraham Lincoln.

We\u2019re ready for Donald Trump to be our next president.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)JUDY WOODRUFF: Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions met with Trump today, too, as did former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

That means going after his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. She appeared today in Springfield, Illinois, where President Lincoln long ago warned of a house divided. Clinton singled out Trump.HILLARY CLINTON (D), Presumptive Presidential Nominee: His campaign is as divisive as any we have seen in our lifetimes. It is built on stoking mistrust and pitting American against American.JUDY WOODRUFF: But Trump is also taking fire from an unexpected quarter, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In recent days, she told The New York Times \u2014 quote \u2014 \"I can\u2019t imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president.\"Ginsburg made similar remarks in other interviews, and Trump fired back in an early-morning tweet. He said Ginsburg \u2014 quote \u2014 \"embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot. Resign.\"It was amid that furor that Trump\u2019s camp said he was aiming to make a final running mate decision by Friday.And we unpack it all now with Susan Page, Washington bureau chief for USA Today, and Robert Costa, national political reporter at The Washington Post.And there\u2019s a lot to talk about, but, Susan, let\u2019s start with the veep search on Donald Trump\u2019s part, very public. What do you make of this process, including his children, and all these interviews? And does it come down to these three or four people?SUSAN PAGE, USA Today: This is just one more way in which Donald Trump has changed the way we view politics, how politics works.The vice presidential search is usually something that\u2019s very coy. They\u2019re talking to the people who are being talked about, say they\u2019re not interesting or try to tamp down speculation about it. In this case, we have had tryouts in front of our eyes about whether they can be at a rally with Trump, how they connect with him.So that has been different, and I think that\u2019s been a good thing. I think we\u2019re seeing now is a debate between Donald Trump\u2019s head and his heart, because his head says Mike Pence is a guy who rounds out his resume, who gives him some unity with parts of the Republican Party like evangelicals and Tea Party types that he does haven\u2019t the best relationships with.But I bet his heart is saying Gingrich or Chris Christie or just guys he would prefer to be around and rather see in that debate against Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential candidate.JUDY WOODRUFF: Robert Costa, what are you learning about all this? Where do you think Donald Trump is right now in this?ROBERT COSTA, The Washington Post: I think Susan\u2019s spot-on with her analysis.What I\u2019m hearing from Trump campaign associates is that Pence is at the top of the list for many of the family members who traveled with Trump today in Indiana. Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman, is also said to be inclined toward the Indiana governor.But that means \u2014 that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Trump has made a decision. He\u2019s flying to California tonight with a populist conservative from Alabama, Senator Jeff Sessions. And he is continuing to try to think through his options, wondering whether he wants an attack dog or, as Susan said, someone to round out that resume.JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Susan, so what does that say to us that it\u2019s narrowed down to these four, and including, as Robert said, Senator Sessions from Alabama?SUSAN PAGE: Yes, and we\u2019re not quite sure why Senator Sessions is on that list. He was an early supporter, and this may be a way to say thank you to Senator Sessions for standing with him.It tells us he chose only men. The standard political calculation would have had a woman in that mix as a finalist, especially since Donald Trump had some trouble with women voters. He didn\u2019t do that. And it\u2019s people who want to be on the ticket with him.He\u2019s not coaxing somebody who\u2019s reluctant to be on the ticket. He\u2019s going to choose somebody who is out there comfortable auditioning for it.JUDY WOODRUFF: Eager for it.And, Robert Costa, what do you make again of the process? I mean, it stuck that he has his grown children in these meetings. How typical is that?ROBERT COSTA: It\u2019s atypical.Trump doesn\u2019t really function with a normal political organization. He counts on his family for counsel and some advisers. But this is someone who operates by making a lot of phone calls, bringing in friends and different people who he\u2019s been with throughout his life and soliciting their advice, their take on the vice presidential search.And he\u2019s getting a lot of political calculations thrown his way, but what\u2019s most important to Trump, if you read his books or if you speak to him himself, he wants a rapport, he wants a connection, someone he can trust.JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, let\u2019s turn to \u2014 well, we will find out soon enough. We\u2019re told it is going to happen either Thursday or Friday of this week.Let\u2019s turn to this really remarkable, I guess, series of criticisms that the Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has launched on Donald Trump. Very unusual.SUSAN PAGE: Never in modern times have we seen these kind of exchanges.When justices in the past have had a slip of the tongue, as Sandra Day O\u2019Connor did on election night in 2000, it hasn\u2019t been the kind of deliberate attempt we have seen by Justice Ginsburg. She didn\u2019t just say this once. She said it to the Associated Press, and then she said it The New York Times, and then she said it to Joan Biskupic.So, this was a message she wanted to get out. And it\u2019s managed to get The Post and The Times to editorialize on Trump\u2019s side. So, that is something very rare in this election season.JUDY WOODRUFF: Robert Costa, how is the Trump campaign seeing this? As somebody who covers politics, how unusual does it look to you to hear a Supreme Court justice going after a political candidate?ROBERT COSTA: It is unusual.But inside of the Trump campaign today in Indiana, they are framing the justice\u2019s comments as condescension, condescension that Trump may try to use, in his mind, for political advantage by running as someone who\u2019s politically incorrect, anti-establishment. They think this kind of battle playing out in public could be useful to Trump in the coming months as he tries to solidify himself as someone who is an outsider.JUDY WOODRUFF: That\u2019s my question, Susan. What kind of \u2014 does something like this have consequences down the road?SUSAN PAGE: I\u2019m not sure this is very \u2014 I\u2019m not sure this has big consequences.I think if you agree with Justice Ginsburg, you probably think, hey, great, I\u2019m glad she spoke up. If you disagree with her, you\u2019re probably on Trump\u2019s side. There are going to be a lot of things that are very important in this election. And I think this is one of the things that\u2019s more interesting of the moment than something with lasting political consequences.JUDY WOODRUFF: The last thing I want to ask you both about is what\u2019s been going on already in Cleveland this week, and that is meetings of different Republican committees.One of them has to do with the convention, one of them, Robert, having to do with the platform. It is looking to be a pretty conservative document. What do we know about that? What does that say to us? Should we even be paying attention to it?ROBERT COSTA: The platform is very ideologically conservative.And this is a way the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee believe they can make an overture to the elements of the Republican Party that are disgruntled about Trump\u2019s nomination. And they are saying, look, Trump may be more centrist and populist on a lot of these issues, but when it comes to the party, we\u2019re still down the line, even hard-line conservative.What\u2019s most important here is that the Republican National Committee is trying to tamp down any kind of revolt or uprising among these delegates against Trump. And Republican Chairman Priebus is working closely with Trump to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen.JUDY WOODRUFF: So, they\u2019re using this as a way to tamp down disagreement?SUSAN PAGE: But they\u2019re creating big problems for themselves with some of the groups that after that \u2014 in that autopsy they did after the 2012 defeat, they said they needed to do \u2014 they needed to do, for instance, more to reach out to young people, to African-Americans, to Hispanics, to gay people.This platform doesn\u2019t do any of that. The stance on gay rights, on gay marriage is more conservative than the platform that was enacted in 2012. So, in terms of appealing, say, to millennials, this is not going to do the Republican Party any good.JUDY WOODRUFF: You were telling me that it has even language in there about requiring \u2014 looking at conversion therapy for individuals who are gay.SUSAN PAGE: It has language that approves of parents using this controversial technique called conversion therapy for their gay children. That\u2019s something that even Chris Christie signed a law banning.JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly, Robert, so are these things that we can expect Donald Trump to try to implement?ROBERT COSTA: Unlikely.If you look at Donald Trump, he had a phone call in recent weeks with Caitlyn Jenner. He\u2019s someone who comes out of Manhattan. He\u2019s comfortable with people of all different backgrounds and orientations. He\u2019s not a social conservative. He\u2019s never really been a traditional social conservative, but he\u2019s running to be the standard bearer of a party the Times Square has moved increasingly to the right.JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, some interesting questions.

The Pokemon Company had no official comment about when the app will release outside Australia and New Zealand, however, The Wall Street Journal's Takashi Mochizuki was told by The Pokemon Company that it is asking U.S. and Japanese players to \"please wait a while\" for the app to launch in their regions.Despite the app, which allows players to capture Pokemon in the real world around them, not being officially available outside certain regions, users have already figured out how to download GO in other territories.For Android users, as noted by Eurogamer, the game's APK file is available online from unofficial sources to allow players to download the game in the U.S. and the U.K. Directly clinking the link in the Google Play store at this time in the U.S. and Europe will not allow players to download the game properly.iOS users can change the region of their App Store to New Zealand or Australia or create a new account directly tied to those territories \u2014 however, both App Store territories require local payment information of some kind to properly register an ID tied to either region.So When Will Pokemon GO Officially Release Worldwide?While there's no word from Niantic or the Pokemon Company about an exact release rollout, the way the game's field test beta was released, in conjunction with its initial debut in Australia and New Zealand, could suggest when other players will have official access to the app.Pokemon Go New Images 46 IMAGES View Slideshow Return To Article Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC Pokemon Go New Images OF 46 DownloadThe field test originally began in Japan in March of this year, followed by Australia and New Zealand in April and then sign-ups in the United States launched in May, with the beta having come to an end in June.

It was later acknowledged in the stream that the app would need to be ready before its accompanying device, the Pokemon GO Plus Wristband.

Cory Gardner (R-Colorado) sent a letter to Holder questioning the DOJ's authority to override federal law.But Gardner's concern isn't simply with the legal ins and outs of recreational marijuana. What he really wants to know is if this DOJ decision sets a new precedent for states to opt out of other federal laws -- like President Obama's signature health care package, the Affordable Care Act. Gardner writes:I write to question the Department\u2019s constitutional authority on overriding federal law and seek answers as to whether this action sets precedent to allow states to opt out of other federal laws. While I commend the DOJ for finally issuing guidance after nearly ten months since Colorado voters legalized marijuana\u2019s recreation use, its new policies are in contrast to the Controlled Substances Act. Essentially, DOJ policy now allows states like Colorado to opt out of federal marijuana laws. Do you believe the DOJ has the authority to override federal law? Do you believe you have the authority to change law without the approval of Congress?Colorado and Washington voters approved the use of recreational marijuana for adults 21-and-over last November. Last week in a joint phone call, Holder told the governors that the DOJ would take a \"trust but verify approach\" to the state laws. But the department is reserving its right to file a preemption lawsuit at a later date because marijuana possession and sale continue to be illegal federally, under the Controlled Substances Act.And that discrepancy between state and federal laws with regard to marijuana has Gardner wondering if similar logic could be applied to Obamacare as well. Via Gardner's letter:Finally, the new DOJ policies seem to imply that federal authorities will not preempt state laws. Does this set a precedent for other areas? For example, several states have passed laws to opt out of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, yet the federal government has consistently said it will take over health insurance industries regardless of states that contest the law. If you do not agree that there is a precedent set, would you explain the inconsistencies of why in certain areas federal law may be deemed irrelevant, but not in others?Gardner is a vocal opponent of Obamacare and one of many Republicans who continually seek to have it repealed. Just before their summer recess, the House GOP voted to repeal Obamacare for the 40th time.

The summers at Scout camp taught me discipline and threw me together with new kids and adults, whom I learned to work with.John H. Johnson credits Scouting as a life-forming experience that instilled skills he would one day use to turn his head for statistics into the profitable company Edgeworth Economics.Edgeworth, a seven-year-old firm, provides expert testimony mostly for companies whose very futures may be at stake, or what is known in legal circles as \"bet-the-company litigation.\" Its deep-data analysis helps big corporations and others win lawsuits and get a leg up on labor negotiations. Its me\u0301tier is producing experts who can testify in depositions \u2014 the pretrial interviews that can make or break a case.\"I got my business skills in the Boy Scouts,\" said Johnson, a self-described \"geeky kid\" who became an Eagle Scout. \"Boy Scouts forced me to confront a bunch of things. It taught me how to get things done, identify strengths and weaknesses of people. I can remember learning the hard way that if you don\u2019t get the troop to collect enough firewood, you have a big problem when it gets dark.\"Edgeworth has generated enough wealth for Johnson, its co-founder, chairman and sole owner, to afford a couple of nice homes here and on Martha\u2019s Vineyard.He has had an impact on big issues, such as where the National Football League should place the ball on kickoffs and whether players\u2019 careers would be shortened if the league added two games to the regular season (the answer was yes).His success also allows this numbers cruncher to moonlight as a radio-show guest, TV polling expert and author who distills his data into bite-size, digestible nuggets.He can discuss everything from autism to climate change to whether coffee causes cancer.

The company recruits PhDs at all the top universities, including MIT, Yale, Princeton, Chicago and Columbia. People from other consulting firms will also approach the company. The trick is taking that bandwidth and getting them to explain it like a game-show host.\"You must be able to explain complex concepts simply and directly,\" Johnson said. \"You must be honest, objective, a good teacher, and you must answer the relevant questions.\"Johnson wouldn\u2019t identify his clients, but according to public records over the years, Edgeworth has represented Hershey\u2019s, Bloomberg, Starbucks, Google and Hostess.Edgeworth has about a dozen people who testify, and they are paid well for their work. Hourly billing ranges from $500 to more than $1,000. That means the company makes money. A lot of money. There are small companies like dry cleaners or framing shops that are known in business school circles as NLOs \u2014 for \"Nice Living for the Owner.\" I regard Edgeworth as a really nice living for the owner.There is no debt on the company\u2019s books, and Johnson financed the company himself. As with most professional services businesses, labor costs consume about a third of the revenue. There is also $850,000 in leases to be paid on offices in Washington, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Johnson said employee benefits amount to more than $1,000 a month per employee. That includes health, gym and transportation benefits as well as a 401(k) match.Johnson, 43, grew up near Buffalo and was blessed with smarts. \"When I was a kid, I was totally into school. I was always the best in my class.\"He earned a doctorate in economics from MIT in 1999 after getting his undergraduate degree from the University of Rochester. So he has some gray matter to work with.His doctoral dissertation sought to answer the question of whether long work hours lead to divorce.The answer: Not if you make at least $35 an hour.\"There was a cutoff point where more money meant it was likely that you were to stay in the marriage.\"Johnson decided early on that he didn\u2019t want to stay in academia, so he and his wife came to Washington in search of opportunities.He went into economic consulting and took at a job at National Economic Research Associates. That was his baptism into the world of answering practical questions and learning about litigation and how to testify. He also managed teams of young researchers and learned how to manage the firm\u2019s clients as well. Many were law firms trying to untangle a client from a sticky case.His first big case had all the sex appeal of a rope burn. It involved a product called Polyester Staple Fibers \u2014 tiny fibers that make up suits and rugs \u2014 and a class-action suit on price fixing. (It was settled out of court.)After seven years and a taste of everything National Economic Research Associates had to offer, Johnson launched Edgeworth, naming the firm after a 19th century Irish philosopher and political economist whose work inspired Johnson to create a collaborative culture that shared more of the firm\u2019s wealth.After early success with the NFL Players Association, other big clients began to roll in. Revenue started climbing \u2014 from $750,000 in 2009 to $13 million by 2012 and $25 million last year.Edgeworth\u2019s head count has climbed, too, going from six in 2009 to just under 100.As part of his collaborative culture, Johnson promotes his employees to become testifiers and give themselves a shot at some big bucks. He said he doesn\u2019t hog the cases himself.\"We recruit the best and the brightest and turn them into experts,\" he said. \"I train people on how to improve their career. Nothing makes me happier than when a lawyer who worked with me calls one of my colleagues and says, \u2018I want to give you an opportunity to testify in this case.\u2019 \"Johnson is sitting pretty these days, with an expansive office that has a block-long view of 19th Street NW and is filled with sports memorabilia. A conspicuous trophy case houses his collection of professional wrestling belts from World Wrestling Entertainment. Go figure.Toward the end of our interview, I asked Johnson why he left National Economic Research Associates, where he had a sinecure and where a good future awaited him. All he had to do was wait his turn.\"I didn\u2019t want to wait,\" he said. \"I had my own ideas of how to treat employees, how I wanted to develop business and how I wanted to create a culture.

Start here with these ten easy and delicious rules.1. Rule #1: Eat Two Pounds Of VegetablesEvery single day. \"Loading your diet with vegetables will naturally crowd out things you shouldn't be eating,\" says Joel Fuhrman, MD, author of Eat to Live Cookbook, who recommends this amount after analyzing studies connecting vegetable consumption with overall health. Aim for one pound raw and one pound cooked: Certain cancer-fighting compounds in some vegetables, like broccoli, cabbage, and kale, are better absorbed raw, while cooking others (carrots, sweet corn) can boost their levels of antioxidants. Though two pounds might sound like a lot, a single sweet potato can get you a quarter of the way there. \"You don't necessarily need to measure your food; just use this figure as a reminder to eat a hefty amount of veggies every day,\" Fuhrman says. \"Work in cooked greens and interesting stir-fries, and you're set.\"Rule #2: Put An Egg On ItSo long as you have eggs in the refrigerator, you can throw together a healthy dinner in the same amount of time you'd need to order takeout. You can top a pita with a baked (or fried) egg and some cheese (see recipe below) or add an egg to a bowl of rice, dressed salad greens, or cooked vegetables.Get the recipe: Egg-Topped Pita PizzaRule #3: Sub In SeedsThese oft-forgotten all-stars come packed with key nutrients we all need: protein, healthy fats, and essential fatty acids. Toss a handful of hempseeds into the blender when making a smoothie, sprinkle chia seeds or flaxseeds on top of oatmeal, or swap sunflower or pumpkin seeds wherever you usually use nuts, like in this winter pesto, which tastes delicious spread on a sandwich or drizzled over roasted squash.Get the recipe: Spinach-Pepita PestoRule #4: Make Your Own Junk FoodSure, there are moments when no one can come between you and your potato chips. Which is why banning them isn't the goal -- it's making them at home. \"Junk food is wonderful,\" says Michael Pollan, author of Cooked. \"But it's become so cheap that we eat it too often. When we used to have to make it ourselves -- and a long time ago we did! -- there was a built-in check on overconsumption.\" Take French fries: You peel the potatoes, cut them into matchsticks, fry them in oil, and make a mess in your kitchen while you're at it. If you decide to go the DIY route, says Pollan, \"you will not do that more than once a month -- I promise you.\"Processed Food 101Eating more real food doesn't mean avoiding all packaged goods. While anything that comes in a sealed bag or a box is \"processed\" to some degree (the term simply refers to food that's been changed from its original state), not all packaging automatically indicates a dietary no-no. Here's what to look for.BuyWashed greens, sliced vegetables, and roasted nuts: They're minimally processed, simply prepped for convenience. Packaged at their peak (to lock in flavor and nutrition), canned beans and tomatoes and frozen produce are also fine choices. But you don't have to limit yourself to these. The real trick is reading labels: \"If you recognize most ingredients as food,\" says Darya Pino Rose, PhD, author of Foodist, \"or what comes from the ground or an animal, you're in good shape.\"SkipPackaged foods with unpronounceable ingredients and processed with added sweeteners, oils, and preservatives to boost flavor and texture or extend shelf life. A few major culprits: chips, crackers, and microwavable meals you find in the freezer aisle. Says Rose: \"If it's frozen with a lot of ingredients, you're shopping in the wrong section.\"Rule #5: Prep Breakfast\"If you feel overwhelmed by the transition to eating more real food, just start with breakfast,\" says Lisa Leake, blogger at 100DaysofRealFood.com, who challenged herself and her family to avoid highly processed food and has never looked back. \"Most of us eat the same thing in the morning, so changing this one meal can have a big impact.\" Follow Leake's lead and carve out time on Sundays to make a week's worth of breakfasts, like these parfaits. Assemble the yogurt and fruit and store the parfaits in individual jars, one for each day of the week, in the refrigerator. Top with granola when you're ready to eat.Get the recipe: Maple Granola and Yogurt ParfaitsRule #6: Build Your BasesMake your life easier by preparing batches of foods you can combine into multiple meals. Start with a pot of grains or beans -- or both -- every week. \"A pound of dried beans costs about $1. Once they're cooked, it's a snap to add them to any soup or salad,\" says Mark Bittman, New York Times food columnist and author of VB6 and the forthcoming VB6 Cookbook. Apply this strategy to roasted vegetables (broccoli, butternut squash) and dressed hardier greens (kale, Swiss chard). \"Don't roast just two sweet potatoes; roast six,\" he says. \"The more you cook and have stuff around, the less you'll depend on junk.\" Start with these fridge-friendly staples.KaleIn a large bowl, combine 2 stemmed, chopped bunches of Tuscan or lacinato kale (2 pounds), 1 Tbsp. olive oil, and the zest and juice of 1 lemon. Season with pepper and massage until softened, 5 minutes. When ready to eat, salt to taste. Makes about 10 cups.Sweet PotatoesPreheat oven to 400\u00b0. Prick 6 medium sweet potatoes with a fork. Transfer to a baking sheet and roast until tender, 45 to 60 minutes.Herb-Tahini DressingIn a food processor fitted with a metal blade, add 1\u20442 cup roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley, 1\u20442 cup tahini, 6 roughly chopped scallions, 2 cloves garlic, the zest and juice of 2 lemons, 2 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar, 1\u20442 tsp. salt, and 1\u20442 tsp. pepper and pulse to combine. With the motor running, add 1/3 cup olive oil in a thin stream until combined. Makes 1 cup.FarroIn a medium pot, combine 3 cups water, 1 cup rinsed farro, and 1\u20444 tsp. salt. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer until tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Drain excess water. Makes 3 cups.Store each base in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to a week and reheat as needed.Mix and Match Your Make-AheadsTacos: Whole wheat tortilla + Sweet potato mashed with spoonful of plain yogurt + Dressed kale + Sliced avocadoKale Salad: Dressed kale + Herb-tahini dressing + Cooked farro + Kalamata olives + Thinly sliced cucumberWinter Farro: Cooked farro + Dressed kale + Shaved Parmesan + Toasted walnuts + Golden raisinsTopped Sweet Potato: Split-open baked sweet potato + Cooked faro + Shredded rotisserie chicken + Herb-tahini dressingRule #7: Eat a Vegan LunchEach year, the average American consumes 175 pounds of meat and poultry, almost double the global average. Eating less red meat may do you a favor: It can lower your risk of cancer and heart disease. \"Learn to love big heaps of vegetables,\" Bittman says, \"and pile them on until you're more than satisfied.\" To achieve that feeling, try meatless proteins, such as lentils, edamame (see the Soba Noodle Bowl, below), and tofu (\"so underappreciated; it's a blank slate you can do a lot with,\" he says). \"Head to a place with options, like a salad bar, and experiment.\"Get the recipe: Soba Noodle BowlRule #8: Ditch the WhitesWhite FlourThe milling process strips the grains of most of their nutrition. The result: \"White flour digests in your body rapidly, which makes blood sugar spike,\" says Foodist author Rose. (Cue the almost inevitable crash.) \"It should be a supplement to your diet, not the main event.\" Try more-nutritious flours, like almond, coconut, and chickpea. One easy way to start: Substitute white whole wheat flour for 1/3 cup (or more) of the white flour in recipes.White SugarResearch suggests that sugar can be addictive. And it's a sneaky ingredient added to processed foods that don't even taste sweet, like bread and pasta sauce. Reach for organic honey or maple syrup instead; they're less refined and offer small amounts of antioxidants. (Still, aim for no more than 24 grams of added sugar per day.) Steer clear of foods with sugar listed among the first three ingredients -- and that includes agave nectar, evaporated cane juice, malt syrup, and anything ending in \"-ose.\" (\"There are 1,001 code names!\" warns Rose.)Rule #9: Go with the Grains\"Ancient varieties are super-nutrient-rich and offer long-lasting energy,\" says Mollie Katzen, author of the cookbook The Heart of the Plate. And it doesn't take much for quinoa, amaranth, and spelt to go beyond ho-hum: \"Once you add saute\u0301ed garlic or scallions, they come to life.\" These staples also add texture and heft when stirred into soups and stews and sprinkled on salad greens. Here are five ways to cook supergrains in less than 30 minutes.Rule #10: Don't Ban Dessert\"You can totally build dessert into healthy eating,\" says Ellie Krieger, host of the Food Network show Healthy Appetite. \"If you say, 'I'm never having it,' you give all things sweet an enticing, forbidden-fruit aura. When you inevitably give in, it becomes a mindless munchfest.\" Reach for better-for-you desserts like this clever chocolate pudding, made creamy by its secret ingredient: avocado.Get the recipe: Chocolate Avocado Pudding", "answers": {"answer_start": [1087], "text": ["eggs"]}, "id": "431147404075999232"}, {"question": "POLITICS Muslim Vet Booted From Trump Rally, Told To \"Get A Job.\" Guess What He Does For A Living...", "context": "One of the most perplexing parts of the Donald Trump experience is that his fans don\u2019t seem to believe in anything.

There\u2019s still no cure for the common cold, for example. Our conditioner always seems to run out before our shampoo. And we still have no scientifically proven way to avoid blisters. Well, we can cross that last one off the list, at least. A study published today in the Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine reports a simple, cheap method for blister prevention\u2014and it\u2019s available in any drugstore.Grant Lipman is an emergency medicine doctor working with some of the blister-iest feet in the world: those of runners. \"What I kept hearing was, 'Doctor, I'd be doing so well, if only for my feet,'\" Lipman said in a press statement. \"Their feet were getting decimated.\"Military doctors told him that blisters were keeping their patients from completing basic training. The angry sores that form from repeated pressure and friction, and the infections they caused, were hobbling our armed forces.\"People have been doing studies on blister prevention for 30 or 40 years and never found anything easy that works,\" Lipman said. \"I wanted to look at this critically.\"So he and a team of his colleagues in emergency and sports medicine put their heads together and decided to test one method that patients had mentioned again and again: paper tape. Paper tape, also known as surgical tape, is a mildly sticky adhesive tape used in hospitals to cover wounds. A roll of paper tape will run you less than a dollar at your local drug store, and anyone can apply it.Lipman decided to put the tape to the ultimate test: actual ultramarathons. These extreme footraces are legendary for breaking down runners\u2019 bodies and minds . If paper tape could help runners get through an ultramarathon\u2014in this case, the seven-day, 155-mile RacingthePlanet event\u2014that would be pretty good evidence in its favor.RacingthePlanet runners literally become globetrotters, completing the race's six stages in different parts of the world. Before the event began, researchers recruited 128 runners: 19 participants from the Jordan segment, 35 from the Gobi, 21 from Madagascar, and 53 from the Atacama Desert. Each participant told study staff about their personal blister history.Medics associated with the study then applied tape to one foot on each runner. If the runner was blister-prone, the medic stuck tape in areas of previous problems. Otherwise, the location of the tape was randomly assigned to one of four blister-likely areas: the toes, instep, outstep, or heel.Then the race began. By the finish line, 109 participants (that is, 109 feet) remained in the study. On those feet, the researchers found 97 blisters\u2014but only 28 of those were located in taped areas. The cheapo paper tape had blocked blisters in 74 percent of runners.\"It's kind of a ridiculously cheap, easy method of blister prevention,\" Lipman said. \"You can get it anywhere.

They're tricky little suckers whose psychological effects oftentimes sneak up on us when we don't even know it.There are lots of words we use nowadays that I hate -- I'm still waiting for YOLO to die and awesome-sauce really gets under my skin -- but one word in particular really makes me cringe: rant.I've seen this ugly little word pop up in news headlines a lot lately. Particularly when someone like Kanye West is talking about classism and inequality, or Richard Sherman screams in a little, blonde white woman's face, or most recently, when Spike Lee candidly educates people about the problems of gentrification.\"Rant\" has become our go-to word to describe the inane topics and wordy arguments our ever-shortening attention spans have developed less and less patience for, even when those topics are relevant arguments we should, in fact, be spending more time discussing.The problem with describing these black men's sentiments as rants is we write off their ideas as unimportant, mundane and imply that they're somewhat mentally unstable. These men are on a tirade. They are loud and uncontrollable, and they have stepped outside the limits of what society deems acceptable behavior for black men -- and we all know what happens when white folks get nervous about black men acting out.Using the word \"rant\" has become our way of invalidating opinions, it's our way of ignoring the issues we don't want to see hold power because the word automatically characterizes the argument as unimportant before you even read what the person had to say. And of course, it's not exclusive to its use with black men -- when I see it after Ted Nugent's name, I automatically think fanatical, Tea Party Conservatives, but who wants to hear what they have to say anyway? (kidding)Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying everything that comes out of Kanye West's mouth is comprehensible, but I bet you've missed a few great points he has made because you've written it off as \"just another rant.\" And I know many of you will think that I'm inserting race into something where it didn't exist, but that's the thing about modern-day racism, it's usually a psychological and subconscious perpetration of pejorative language and ideas -- but I digress.The fact of the matter is words have power we don't always acknowledge, and we might want to start paying attention.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1015], "text": ["\"Rant\""]}, "id": "439780646752645120"}, {"question": "Now that Coachella is over what will Vanessa Hudgens do?", "context": "After two star-studded weekends, Coachella has come to a close for 2014.Vanessa Hudgens (and plenty other attendees) apparently didn't get the memo not to wear bindis for round two, but she did party her face off.We're pretty sure that the 25-year-old former Disney star spends most of the year planning for the two-weekend festival in Indio, Calif., and now that it's over we're not sure what she's going to do with herself.\"Coachella.

Now we have proof. Photo: StocksyPeople often tell you to make your bed because it \u2018starts the day off well\u2019 or that it brings order and calm.But the lazy among us have always known making your bed is a bad idea.For starters, it\u2019s difficult to see the point of arranging all your throw pillows and stuffed animals on the bed if you\u2019re only going to push them off hours later.If you have to leave the house early in the morning you\u2019re probably all bleary-eyed and you don\u2019t have the time or desire for tackling chores.Even if you thought about making your bed, as soon as someone nags you to do it, that immediately makes you not want to do it. It\u2019s all very complicated.Plus, it\u2019s harder to get comfortable in your bed if it\u2019s been made and the sheets are firmly tucked in. (I like to create a cocoon out of blankets and fold all the sheets up around my legs, to the point where it\u2019s stupidly warm, which is why bed-making is not for me.)Another thing to consider: if you make your bed in the morning, that means you\u2019re telling yourself that you won\u2019t be getting back into it for the rest of the day, and you just don\u2019t need to place those boundaries on yourself.Finally, all these very valid points have now also been backed up by scientific evidence. Thanks science.According to reports, making your bed every morning may be bad for your health.The reason is dust mites; they don\u2019t just look nasty, they are nasty.In the average bed there\u2019s as many as 1.5 million microscopic mites crawling around and feasting off the skin cells you shed while you sleep.In the morning, if you make your bed immediately, all of the skin cells, sweat, mites and their droppings \u2013 which can cause asthma and allergies \u2013 will be trapped underneath.However, if the bed is left unmade, the mites, dead skin, the sweat, all of it, will be exposed to fresh air and light.So, if you have to make your bed it is better to wait until the evening. By that point your bed is much less appealing to dust mites and they will have died from dehydration or just lost interest.What you should do to mitigate allergies is wash your sheets every one-to-two weeks, use a damp mop or rag to remove dust and encase your mattress and pillows in dust-proof or allergen impermeable covers.There you have it.

Uncle Rhabdo is a cartoon commonly referenced in CrossFit literature and representative of a troubling trend among CrossFitters.He's a clown. Literally.The \"Uncle Rhabdo\" cartoon depicts an exhausted, yet well-muscled clown, connected to a dialysis machine standing next to some workout equipment. Concernedly, his kidney has fallen out and lies on the floor underneath him, along with some portion of his bowel. He's left a pool of blood on the floor below him, but it's not clear if this is from the disembowelment, the kidney's arterial supply, or the collection of fasciotomies he appears to have endured. Uncle Rhabdo, of course, has rhabdomyolysis.Rhabdomyolysis, apart from being a subtly pleasant and melodic sounding word, is an uncool, serious and potentially fatal condition resulting from the catastrophic breakdown of muscle cells. We'll get more into the specifics in just a bit, but first let's begin with a story.A Tale of RhabdomyolysisOne day, a very fit, young, physical therapist colleague of mine went to CrossFit. She had been many times before. On this warm Texas evening, she performed a partner workout, where each would trade off performing sets of 10 for each exercise. The workout consisted of pushups. Lots of them. Copious amounts of overhead press were also included.She performed hundreds of repetitions of each. She was a champ!\"I didn't want to not match my partner. Normally I may have rested a little, but the partner workout kept me going.\"Both of these activities heavily involve the triceps muscles and so she wasn't surprised to have her beautiful, sculpted arms feel like poorly set bowls of JELL-O on the way home from CrossFit. Perhaps it was the heat. Maybe it was the sheer number of exercises she did. Her muscles were in crisis. She iced and hydrated when she got home, like a good little exerciser, but the damage was already done.As physical therapists, we're finely tuned detection machines looking for normal versus abnormal response to exercise and activity. \"Is this supposed to hurt?\" is a question we respond to hundreds of times in a week. Sometimes the answer to this question is yes and we encourage the individual to press on, and other times it's a signal to initiate some rest and recovery. This signal detection is one of the things that's deeply embedded into physical therapists. We can't help it. And so when my friend awoke the next morning, her abnormal response alarms were blaring. She couldn't bend her elbows! She couldn't even reach her mouth to brush her teeth.Still entrenched in the CrossFit culture of deplete, endure, repeat, she quieted the alarms and stoically pressed on to go to work. It didn't take long to realize she not only couldn't bend her arms, they also had no strength. She wasn't able to treat her patients. By that evening, her slender arms had continued to swell into plump hotdogs of ache and regret, and she was starting to come to the realization that the morning's danger alarms were legitimate.Unbelievably, it took another 24 hours for her professional sense to break through the grip of the CrossFit culture, and seek medical attention. She was diagnosed with acute rhabdomyolysis, and ended up in the hospital for over a week. While in the emergency department they tested her creatinine kinase (CPK) levels. Normal is about 100. Her CPK levels were more than 45,000, a number that indicated damage to the kidneys.While in the hospital, she called to cancel her CrossFit membership. As is standard when something is cancelled, the CrossFit coach asked the reason for her decision. She replied, \"I'm in the hospital.\" The instructor quickly asked, \"Is it rhabdo?\"And here we have arrived at CrossFit's dirty little secret. The coach was unusually familiar with what is normally a very rarely seen disorder. It's so rare that one study reported the overall annual incidence of rhabdomyolysis to be 0.06 percent. That represents single digits of cases out of hundreds of thousands of patients. How, I wondered, is it possible that the layperson exercise instructor is on a first-name basis with a serious, yet rare medical condition? Is this a thing with CrossFit? It turns out it is.Rhabdomyolysis: As Told By CrossFit?A quick search of the Interwebs reveals copious amounts of information about rhabdo purveyed by none other than CrossFit trainers. Scouring the scientific literature in mainstream medical journals, however, reveals a only a few peer-reviewed papers. The science confirms that exertional rhabdomyolysis, as this form is sometimes referred to, is uncommon and normally reserved for the elite military trainee, ultra-endurance monsters, and for victims of the occasional psychotic football coach. Rhabdomyolysis isn't a common condition, yet it's so commonly encountered in CrossFit that they have a cartoon about it, nonchalantly casting humor on something that should never happen.So what is rhabdomyolysis exactly? Under extreme conditions your muscles cells explode. They die. They leach protein out into the blood stream, including one form called myoglobin. Ever stalwart, your kidneys take up the job of clearing these dangerous proteins from the blood. Why? It's just what they do. Unfortunately, myoglobin proteins aren't designed to be in the blood in the first place and they can easily overload the kidney. This can produce injury or death to all or part of the kidney in a short amount of time, and is potentially lethal. Locally, the muscles are left damaged and dying. Swelling ensues and weakness occurs as pressure builds around the remaining muscle cells. Your body's systems that normally can assist with this local muscle damage are now offline trying to help you not die. If you get to this stage, you're in serious trouble.In some cases, acute compartment syndrome ensues, which is an emergency condition that can result in loss of a limb unless your connective tissue is slashed open to release the swelling , a procedure called a fasciotomy. None of this is something that people should be handling in such a cavalier manner.So what gives? As early as 2005, the New York Times documented rhabdomyolysis associated with the culture of CrossFit in a piece entitled, \"Getting Fit, Even If It Kills You.\" The article included this gem of a quote:\"Yet six months later Mr. Anderson, a former Army Ranger, was back in the gym, performing the very exercises that nearly killed him. \"I see pushing my body to the point where the muscles destroy themselves as a huge benefit of CrossFit,\" he said.\"What does CrossFit's founder, Greg Glassman think of this?\"It can kill you,\" he said. \"I've always been completely honest about that.\"Fast forward to 2013 and this culture has changed little, perhaps even accelerated. As Jason Kessler pointed out in \"Why I Quit CrossFit,\" the elitist, push yourself to the limit culture of the discipline has increased in light of commercial interests taking hold. Regarding culture, Jason points out:\"If you ask a CrossFit coach, the injuries were all my fault. In a culture that drives you to go as hard and fast as possible, it's difficult not to get caught up in the hype. You're supposed to push yourself to the limit, but when you hit the limit and pay the price, you're the idiot who went too far.\"In another psychotic example of how the overwhelming culture of CrossFit can diminish professional common sense, one gynecologist was quoted dishing this nonsense:\"Ladies, in my professional opinion, it is okay to pee during double unders.\"No, peeing during a workout is not alright. Ever.To underline the point, MoveForwardPT.com, the official consumer information website of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), hosted an online radio show specifically responding to CrossFit's irresponsible glorification of stress-induced urinary incontinence.The Impact of RhabdomyolysisSometimes rhabdomyolysis gets better with treatment. Sometimes it lingers. Sometimes your kidneys are never the same again. One message board commenter remarked:\"I seem to \"flare\" after any resistance training. I came into this by over training -- I was in phenomenal shape. I have gained weight. I get swollen and puffy. I feel as though the quality of my muscle tissue decreases on a daily basis -- more so than the lack of weight training -- seems to be disintegration.\"My friend experienced a similar, though thankfully less severe long term effect. It's been several months and her triceps strength is not back to normal. Her sculpted arms are gone, replaced by semi-swollen jiggly tissue. Once a muscle tears, damaged, fatty scar tissue replaces the injured muscle tissue. The result is a permanently damaged muscle, and a decreased ability to strength train. The irony of pushups causing flabby arms underscores the age-old mantra: There really is too much of a good thing.CrossFitters, largely unaware of the rhabdo risk, will continue to charge ahead, pressured and happily coerced into exercising to depletion and exhaustion. My prediction: in a few years, the peer-reviewed scientific literature will be ripe with articles about CrossFit and rhabdomyolysis. Health providers will be there to scoop up the pieces, but who is there to protect those people unknowingly at risk?Exercise is just about the best thing you can do for your body, but in the case of CrossFit, we're left to ponder the question, is this workout worth the risk? Can the culture adapt to one that embraces safe training principles? Do coaches truly have the ability to detect what a proper training load is for their athletes? Only time will tell, but the future of CrossFit may depend on it.Eric Robertson is assistant professor of physical therapy at Regis University in Denver, Colorado.

She did, however, mar what would have otherwise been a notably personable performance with one of her worst Goldman Sachs justifications yet.Clinton seemed genuinely flustered by the question\u2014which is odd considering she had to have guessed she\u2019d be fielding the controversy in some form tonight. Her acceptance of $675,000 for three speeches made to the investment firm in 2013 has been a major sticking point for Sanders throughout the debates, and Clinton potentially being beholden to Wall Street one of her biggest criticisms.But when Cooper asked if her speeches constituted an \"error in judgement,\" Clinton responded glibly, \"I made speeches to lots of groups.\" And when he pressed her on the hundreds of thousands of dollars she accepted from the firm, Clinton offered perhaps the worst answer yet:Well, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what they offered. Every Secretary of State I know has done that.\"That\u2019s what they offered.\"An answer that A) doesn\u2019t explain why she thought it prudent to accept that sort of money from Wall Street and B) doesn\u2019t make any sense considering Hillary\u2019s minimum for paid remarks is actually just (\"just\") $200,000. She also claimed that she\u2019d done the speeches under the pretense that she maybe probably wouldn\u2019t be running for president in a few years\u2014which seems absurd to anyone who was even moderately awake that year.Hillary then went on to assure us that Wall Street has absolutely no influence over her whatsoever:But anybody who knows me, who thinks that they can influence me\u2014name anything they\u2019ve influenced me on.

And we get it\u2014dollar stores are full of tremendous discounts you can't find anywhere else and helpful organization items (and yes, also some toxic products that scarred the bejeebers out of us!). But honestly, we've always wanted to know more. Like how is it possible to sell all those items so cheaply? And is that bargain-priced food actually safe to eat?Well thanks to Brandon, a somewhat-secretive Dollar General manager and his recent Reddit post\u2014where he did an \"ask me anything\" Q&A\u2014we now know even more about the popular chains. Here's what we found most interesting about his insider information:1. Dollar stores don't sell items that are faulty or broken\u2014they're discounted for a different reason. \"I assume like any retailer the product is so cheap because it's bought in massive bulk quantities (DG has around 20,000 stores to supply),\" Brandon said. \"To be honest, most of the products that aren't food are made in China, so you can probably guess why it's cheap.\"Most Popular2. But there's one precaution he recommends when buying food: \"It's always a good habit to check expiration dates in any store,\" he said, \"but you should be A-OK if the store team rotates the food.\"3. Yes, the stores are cheap, but the company is not. \"Normal starting pay for managers is 34-40k and is negotiable to some degree,\" Brandon explained. \"I'm in that range. I know another manager that's been with Dollar General for 15 years and gets paid 80k. Your pay depends on the size of the store you manage, location, and time with the company. You also get bonuses but I split those with my crew.\"4. And the company seems pretty strict. In fact, you can get fired on the spot for something seemingly harmless. When asked if he ever lost his keys, he replied, \"If you lose your keys you get fired instantly, so thankfully no.\"5. The unofficial biggest seller may (or may not) surprise you. \"The biggest steady seller for a single item would have to be cigarettes,\" he said, \"around 600 packs a week sold at my store.\"6. And the most shoplifted items are...odd. \"The two most shoplifted items is a tie between clothes and Tide Pods,\" the manager said. \"People were just slicing open the Tide Pod Pouches and dumping them into a bag. But I've seen a lot of stupid things get stolen like two packs [of] hot cocoa mix out of a box, a few trash bags out of a box, a few Ziploc bags out of a box that were only a dollar to begin with...tons more.\"7. Laundry products are considered the best deals, according to his customers. \"I get told laundry products. Beer is cheap too, same with phone chargers,\" he said when asked what the best dollar store deals are. \"We have iPhone 5 and 6 chargers for $15, while the stores down the street sell them for $30-40. Most of are our products are cheaper than other big box stores apparently (been told this by customers). Greeting cards are a deal. Most are 50\u00a2-$1. If you go to a place like Hallmark they're about five bucks for the same ones.\"8.

Pourjalali knows of at least one person who, once he proved his U.S. citizenship, was able to save the account.In a statement to Civil Beat, Stafford Kiguchi, spokesman for the Bank of Hawaii, apologized for the inconvenience to customers. \"In response to the customer feedback we received, we are working on a technology solution that may allow the reopening of these accounts, should our customers wish to do so,\" he said.Kiguchi noted that there are many Iranian citizens legally in the U.S. and that there are exceptions to the rules for some situations. \"However, if the person returns to Iran and leaves the account open, the financial institution is required to immediately restrict access to the account.\"Under Iran\u2019s citizenship laws, anyone born there is automatically a citizen, as are the children born outside of Iran to fathers who are Iranian nationals, which includes many Iranian-Americans.Some fear this could lead to U.S. citizens having their bank accounts closed as well.Erich Ferrari is an attorney in Washington, D.C., who specializes in issues related to U.S. trade sanctions. He says he has never seen a case like this and believes the bank went \"way overboard.\"\"What\u2019s problematic here is that Iranians can have dual nationality regardless of if they have a connection there or not,\" or ever go to the country, he said.An Iranian advocacy group is taking on the bank. Jamal Abdi is the policy director at the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), a grassroots organization that addresses issues facing the Iranian community.\"We strongly urge for Bank of Hawaii to reverse this discriminatory action and to ensure its policies do not violate constitutional and legal protections for U.S. persons,\" he said in a Feb. 24 letter on behalf of NIAC.Similar situations have happened before, \"but nothing like this,\" Abdi told Civl Beat. \"Nothing where the bank has stated that they are cutting off customers solely because of their citizenship.\"Last year, more than 20 Iranian students at the University of Minnesota had their accounts terminated by TCF bank, triggered by the bank's investigations into transactions it believed may have violated the federal sanctions.The bank denied it was targeting international students. Students filed a complaint with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights and the bank is now under an investigation to determine if there was discrimination.In 2012, TD Bank in Canada closed the accounts of Iranians due to the federal sanctions, although many who got their accounts closed were shocked and said they hadn\u2019t tried to send any money to Iran.Caught Between Service and ComplianceThe timing of the account closures comes after the U.S. and other world powers agreed to a six-month accord with Iran that began in January, temporarily freezing Iran\u2019s nuclear program and in return easing some of the economic sanctions, allowing for negotiations over a long-term deal on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.Data from the 2010 census showed there were 370 individuals living in Hawaii that identified as Iranian alone or in combination.According to the NIAC, many Iranian students studying in the U.S. have had difficulty paying for their tuition and living expenses because of the sanctions that make it difficult to access or transfer funds that are held in Iran.Ferrari noted that banks operate under strict liability and have been known to refuse to service accounts to people they believe have a connection to Iran. Iran citizens have a higher risk profile, and raise red flags to banks, he said.Kiguchi said that it is difficult for the Bank of Hawaii to monitor when someone returns to Iran. \"We must be able to restrict their use of our internet, telephone and mobile services, or even their ability to write a check to access their accounts while in Iran, or we are in violation of the law. We are caught here between trying to serve our customer and being in compliance with U.S. regulations,\" he said.Abdi says he realizes the banks \"are put in a tough place\" with regard to the sanctions.\"I don\u2019t think that the Bank of Hawaii is intentionally discriminatory against Iranians,\" he said. \"I understand that they\u2019re doing this because of the sanctions.

After all, humans are very likely to disappear long before the sun expands into a red giant and exterminates all living things from the Earth.Assuming that we don\u2019t extinguish all other life as we disappear (an unlikely feat in spite of our unique propensity for driving extinction), history tells us to expect some pretty fundamental changes when humans are no longer the planet\u2019s dominant animal species.So if we were given the chance to peek forward in time at the Earth some 50m years after our disappearance, what would we find? Which animal or group of animals would \"take over\" as the dominant species? Would we have a Planet of the Apes, as imagined in popular fiction? Or would the Earth come to be dominated by dolphins, or rats, or water bears, or cockroaches or pigs, or ants?The question has inspired a lot of popular speculation and many writers have offered lists of candidate species. Before offering any guesses, however, we need to carefully explain what we mean by a dominant species.Let\u2019s Stick To The Animal KingdomOne could argue that the current era is an age of flowering plants. But most people aren\u2019t imagining Audrey Two in Little Shop of Horrors when they envision life in the future (even the fictional triffids had characteristically animal features \u2013 predatory behaviour and the ability to move).Then again, maybe not. Triffid by ShutterstockSo let\u2019s keep the discussion to animals. This is for practical rather than philosophical reasons: by some standards the world is now and always has been dominated by bacteria despite the nominal end of the \"age of microbes\" some 1.2 billion years ago. This was not because bacteria ceased to be, or declined in prevalence, but rather because in our myopia we tend to place more importance on the large multi-cellular organisms that came after.By some accounts four out of five animals is a nematode (a roundworm), so from all these examples it\u2019s clear that neither prevalence, abundance nor diversity is the prime requisite for being a \"dominant\" form of life. Instead our imaginations are captured by large and charismatic organisms.The Meek Shall Inherit the EarthI think you\u2019ll be just ... like ... me. Mirror by ShutterstockThere\u2019s an undeniable degree of narcissism in the human designation of dominant species and a strong tendency to award the title to close relatives. The Planet of the Apes imagines that our closest primate relatives could develop speech and adopt our technology if we gave them the time and space to do so.But non-human primate societies are unlikely to inherit our dominance of the earth, because the apes are likely to precede us to extinction. We are already the only living hominid that\u2019s conservation status is not endangered or critically endangered and the kind of global crisis that would extinguish our species is unlikely to spare the fragile remaining populations of the other great apes. In fact, any extinction event that affects humans will probably be most dangerous to organisms that share our basic physiological requirements.Even if humans succumb to a global pandemic that affects relatively few other mammals, the great apes are precisely the species that are most at risk of contracting any new diseases that drive us from the Earth.Will another, more distant, relative (primate, mammal, or otherwise) develop intelligence and human-like society? That too seems unlikely. Of all the species that were arguably dominant animals at some stage in the history of the Earth, humans are alone in their remarkable intelligence and manual dexterity. It follows that such traits are neither requirements for being dominant among animals, nor particularly likely traits to evolve. Evolution does not favour intelligence for its own sake, but only if it leads to higher survival and reproductive success. Consequently it\u2019s a profound mistake to imagine that our successors are likely to be especially intelligent or social creatures, or that they will be capable of speech, or adept with human technology.So what can we safely speculate about the dominant species, some 50m years after humanity? The answer is both dissatisfying and thrilling all at once: while we can be reasonably confident that it won\u2019t be a talking chimpanzee, we otherwise have no idea what it will look like.The world has seen a number of mass extinction events in the course of its history. The diversification of life following each event was relatively rapid \u2013 and the \"adaptive radiation\" of new species produced new forms including many unlike the ancestral lineages that spawned them after surviving the prior extinction. The small shrew-like creatures that scurried beneath the feet of dinosaurs in the late Cretaceous period looked very different to the cave bears, mastodons and whales which descended from them during the age of mammals. Likewise, the reptiles that survived the late Permian extinction some 250m years ago, which killed off 90% of marine and 70% of terrestrial species did not clearly foreshadow the pterosaurs and dinosaurs and mammals and birds that descended from them.In Wonderful Life: the Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, the late Stephen J. Gould argued that chance, or contingency, as he called it, played a great role during the major transitions of animal life. There is room to argue about the relative importance of contingency in the history of life, which remains a controversial subject today. However Gould\u2019s insight that we can hardly foreshadow the success of modern lineages beyond a future extinction is a humbling reminder of the complexity of evolutionary transitions.So while it may be possible that, as many have speculated, the ants will take over the Earth from us, we can only imagine what their dominant ant descendants will look like.Luc Bussiere, Lecturer , University of StirlingThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

Instead of relying on benchmark testing to compare the two phones, this particular test used a different method intended to compare their performance during real-world usage. The test wasn\u2019t scientific by any means, but the unique format actually does to a pretty decent job of comparing two phones in a real-world setting. Benchmark tests, after all, really only test the capabilities of a smartphone when it\u2019s pushed to its limits. How often do you push your phone to its limits in the real world?In this aforementioned performance test, Apple\u2019s year-old iPhone positively clobbered the brand-spanking-new Galaxy Note 7. Apple fans and Android fans have all been quite vocal about the results since then, but does this test even really matter?MUST SEE: Apple\u2019s iPhone 8 will feature the radical redesign we\u2019ve been waiting forThe video in question has already been viewed more than 1 million times, which shows you just how intense this debate has been. To put that in perspective, most other recent videos posted by the same YouTube user each have view stats in the tens of thousands.Here\u2019s the video in question:The methodology here uses app laps to compare smartphone performance. The YouTuber opens the same series of apps one after the other on both phones and times how long the entire series \u2014 or \"lap\" \u2014 takes. He does two laps with each phone and then compares the results.In a nutshell, the thinking here is that this type of performance test paints a more accurate picture of how a smartphone performs in the real world. After all, you don\u2019t spend most of your time playing insanely complex 3D games on your phone, do you? No, you open apps, switch apps and perform simple tasks most of the time.In this particular test, the iPhone 6s from 2015 beat Samsung\u2019s brand new Galaxy Note 7 by more than 40 seconds on the first lap \u2014 the 6s took 1:22 to complete the lap, while the Note 7 took 2:05. As if that beating weren\u2019t brutal enough, the gap widened to nearly a full minute on the second lap.So... a year-old iPhone with a dual-core processor and 2GB of RAM completely annihilated a brand new flagship Android phone with a quad-core chipset and 4GB of RAM. But does it really matter?There are certainly arguments on both sides of the fence but in the end, yes, it matters.Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy Note 7 is a fantastic smartphone. As we noted in our Galaxy Note 7 review last week, the hardware is phenomenal and the Note-specific software features are outstanding. One thing we brushed by and didn\u2019t really dive into, however, is that the new Note 7 isn\u2019t entirely \"new,\" so to speak. While Samsung\u2019s Note lineup has offered various upgrades over same-year Galaxy S phones in the past, this year Samsung decided to use the same expect processor, camera, and other components from the Galaxy S7.Is that such a bad thing? On its own, no, it\u2019s not a bad thing. The Note 7 offers a very smooth user experience compared to other Android phones, and it has more than enough power to handle heavy lifting.But the Samsung phone\u2019s 6-month-old specs draw attention to the fact that iOS is still far smoother and more responsive than Android. As you can see on Apple\u2019s year-old iPhone 6s, apps are lightning fast. There are a number of important factors that contribute to the iPhone\u2019s silky smooth user experience, such as a powerful custom A9 chipset and optimizations in both third-party apps and iOS itself.This all becomes far more important next month, when Apple releases its next-generation iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple manages to make huge performance gains each year with its new iPhones, and last year\u2019s iPhone 6s is already faster than any flagship Android phone by a landslide.

The post quickly went viral, as many people began debating whether or not this is true, intentional, etc.Since then, literally hundreds (if not thousands) of people have been asking me about Andy\u2019s dad, and I\u2019ve never wanted to address the issue for a few key reasons:It\u2019s depressing. It\u2019s depressing. It\u2019s depressing.You see, I love talking about theories like Andy\u2019s mom and how all of the Pixar movies are connected because that\u2019s tons of fun to think about. Andy\u2019s dad? That\u2019s just...well, you get it.But I can see that a lot of you want to know anyway, and it\u2019s really not that complicated. In fact, this is one of the few theories about Toy Story that I can confidently say is totally intentional.The original theory was first posited by Jess Nevins, an incredibly talented writer who published his take on \"Mr. Davis\" back in 2010. I\u2019ll elaborate on his theory and build upon it with my own insights.Nevins claimed that Andy\u2019s parents are going through a divorce during the events of the first Toy Story. Now, many of you probably saw that coming (it\u2019s pretty obvious, after all), but it\u2019s important to point out that this is not an amicable divorce. Andy\u2019s dad left the family, and there\u2019s plenty of evidence to confirm this.Keep in mind that Andy\u2019s dad is never mentioned or seen throughout the Toy Story movies. If it wasn\u2019t for the rudiments of biology and procreation, then we could just assume that the guy doesn\u2019t even exist. But he does, and all signs point to him walking out on his wife and kids.The Obvious CluesHe may have left right before the first Toy Story started or months before, but one thing is certain: Andy\u2019s dad did not die. If he had died, then why are there no pictures of him on the wall in the Davis house?As you can see from this shot of Toy Story, Andy\u2019s dad is not depicted in these family photos. If he had died, you\u2019d think they would at least keep a picture of him up for the sake of honoring his memory.Of course, you can argue that he died a long time ago, and the family has forgotten about him already. But if that\u2019s the case, then how do you explain the fact that Molly (Andy\u2019s younger sister) is a baby? He would\u2019ve had to have died recently in order for her existence to be possible.It makes more sense to assume that his pictures were taken down, and it would take something despicable on his part for that to happen.To strengthen that point, Andy\u2019s mom is spotted without a wedding ring at Andy\u2019s birthday party in the first film. If Mr. Davis had died recently, then she would probably still be wearing it.Now, I\u2019ll admit that if you really want to, you can come up with a lot of diverting theories to explain all of this by saying Molly was conceived by some other man and that could be why the parents divorced. You could argue that the kids are adopted, or Andy\u2019s mom just \"gets around.\"But don\u2019t you think the creators of Toy Story intended for this to be clear? In this case, the simple explanation is the more likely.After all, the family is moving from a bigger house to a noticeably smaller one in Toy Story, which signals that Andy\u2019s mom is having financial trouble. If she and Mr. Davis were getting a divorce, then he would at least be paying child support, but the family still has to make some sacrifices.Oh, and the family gets a puppy. That\u2019s pretty much the king of single mother cliche\u0301s.Childish CompetitionThe \"deadbeat dad\" theory also explains why Andy is so deeply connected with his toys, especially the masculine figureheads depicted by Woody and Buzz (who are both authoritative models as a \"sheriff\" and a \"space ranger\").What seems like a petty rivalry between two toys vying for Andy\u2019s affection is really an allegory that Andy is playing out in his mind. In the end, their reconciliation and eventual friendship is symbolic of Andy coming to terms with only having his mother around.Woody is the \"old\" father figure that represents where Andy really comes from, while Buzz is the \"new\" future he has to get used to. It\u2019s no wonder Andy is going through emotional whiplash as he has to face the absence of his father and having to move to a totally new house within such a limited amount of time.Now, if you\u2019re a fan of my theory of Pixar movies and the Pixar Detective novel, then a fun way to interpret this is by noting how Woody and Buzz are essentially \"programmed\" to make Andy happy.They may notice that he is torn by his old life and the new one that is being forced upon him, prompting Woody to obsess over making sure Andy still has a connection to his old life, while Buzz is the \"oblivious\" future that just happens upon Andy without him knowing it.A Common ThemeUltimately, this explains why Andy is so deeply immersed with his toys, and it\u2019s a theme that Disney is no stranger to. In many Disney and Pixar films, the main characters are brought up without one or both parents.Movies like this include Up (Russell\u2019s father left him), Tangled (Rapunzel is raised by an evil fake-mother and Flynn is an orphan), Frozen (both parents pass away), A Bug\u2019s Life (Dot and Atta only have their mother), The Princess and the Frog (her father dies early on), Aladdin (Jasmine\u2019s mother is never mentioned and Aladdin\u2019s father is estranged until the third film) and I could go on and on.The simple explanation for this is that many people suffer from broken homes during their formative years, and it\u2019s been reflected in both literature and moviemaking for as long as they\u2019ve been around. It should be no surprise that a fun film like Toy Story has an undercurrent of sadness and (dare I say it) reality lingering in the background.Also, it\u2019s been a tradition for movies and even TV to stray from having both parents onscreen in order to prevent alienating single parents who take their kids to go see movies. Ouch, right in the heart.What the Creators Have to Say About ItNow, if you ask the director of Toy Story, Lee Unkrich, directly, then he\u2019ll give you a mysteriously vague answer. In her article, \"Toy Story 3 and the Triumph of a Single Mother,\" writer Mary Pols spoke with Unkrich himself and gained his thoughts on the matter:\"It\u2019s an oft asked question, but there is no concrete answer, We don\u2019t mean to be mysterious about it; it\u2019s just never been relevant to the story.\" It\u2019s just always been that way. The decision was made really early on in \u2018Toy Story\u2019 to have Andy\u2019s dad not be around. We\u2019ve never addressed it directly, nor have we given any explanation for where he is or why he\u2019s absent.\"As for Unkrich himself (pictured below), his parents divorced when he was 10 years old, and he reportedly grew up with just his mother for some time.On Quora, Craig Good (one of Toy Story\u2018s animators) claims that the decision to exclude Andy\u2019s dad was made because rendering humans was very difficult and expensive at the time, and he wouldn\u2019t be relevant to the story anyway.But that definitely doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t pepper in a few clues that hint at Andy\u2019s father being a deadbeat. That most easily explains why he truly isn\u2019t necessary for the Toy Story movies, especially to the characters who moved on without him.Except for Buzz Lightyear, of course. Even he got a dad in Toy Story 2...Summary:So here it is in a nutshell. Andy\u2019s father most likely walked out on the family, which led to Andy\u2019s mother deciding to relocate to a smaller house to save money and (hopefully) move on from the painful memory. She has removed any pictures she has of him, along with her wedding ring, and the father is never mentioned or seen, even in Andy\u2019s graduation photos.It\u2019s sad and kind of depressing, but inevitably pointless to the story, which is really about a boy and his toys that somehow come to life and compete for his love and imagination.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1338], "text": ["left the family"]}, "id": "547nsi"}, {"question": "Exchange Between An American Navy Ship And Canadian Authorities Is Too Absurd To Believe", "context": "There\u2019s a naval joke floating around the Internet these days that\u2019s getting some attention.

Republican voters turned up their noses at what might have been the most diverse group of presidential hopefuls the Party has put on offer, settling on (way) outsider Donald Trump, who's headlining a riotous convention in Cleveland this week. Democrats will officially nominate Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia next week, concluding a fierce challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders that she and most observers hadn't anticipated gaining nearly as much support. And if the drama on this side of the Atlantic weren't enough, Brits narrowly voted to part ways with the European Union.There\u2019s a single, powerful psychological force that makes all three of these political surprises a lot easier to understand: loss aversion. In general, we work much harder to avoid losses than we do to pursue gains. Here's how it seems to be working lately in U.S. and U.K. politics.Over the past few months, Trump, Sanders, and Brexit campaigners have all met success by reiterating the message that things are headed in the wrong direction\u2014that sticking with the status quo is equivalent to a sure loss. Here\u2019s a sampling:We tried it President Obama\u2019s way\u2014doesn\u2019t work. He gave the world his apology tour.

I find it difficult to contemplate it happening here, but nothing\u2019s impossible. \u2014 Nigel FarageDisavowing business as usual and calling for a clean slate is nothing new. To a certain extent, it's just how most politicians speak. But the the fact that these politicians in particular have each been this successful campaigning almost exclusively on such a message is remarkable. And it highlights a pattern in human behavior that's well-known to psychologists: Our aversion to losses is often powerful enough to cause us to take risks that don\u2019t always make much sense (at least not in the modern world).There are lots of voters who aren\u2019t just clambering for change; they\u2019re willing to take a chance of making things worse in exchange for a chance at making things better.This isn't a political question, it's a probabilistic one. Suppose, for example, that you're facing a certain loss of $3,000. The person to whom you owe that large sum, however, is willing to offer you a type of lottery: You can spin a wheel (one that's been verified as legitimate and will lead to a fair outcome) that will come up red 80% of the time and green 20% of the time. If you spin green, you will owe nothing; if your spin lands on red, however, you'll owe him $4,000. What do you do?On average, the lottery is less attractive than just paying the $3,000 outright. That is, if you spun the wheel over and over you could expect to lose $3,200 per spin. But when faced with this decision in rose . On average, the lottery is less attractive than just paying the $3,000 outright. That is, if you spun the wheel over and over you could expect to lose $3,200 per spin. But when faced with this decision in a study , the overwhelming majority of subjects chose the lottery over the sure loss; their appetite for riskroseOur aversion to losses and our willingness to accept risk are closely intertwined. As of this week, Our aversion to losses and our willingness to accept risk are closely intertwined. As of this week, more than two-thirds of Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, and the sentiment in the U.K. on the eve of the Brexit vote wasn\u2019t much better . In other words, there are lots of voters who aren\u2019t just clambering for change; they\u2019re willing to take a chance of making things worse in exchange for a chance at making things better.If most voters see the status quo as a loss, the Clinton camp may be making things harder for its candidate than necessary.Without question, there are additional psychological forces that have contributed to the Brexit, Sanders, and Trump surprises (not to mention the political ones). Our tendency to focus on the present and our commitment to upholding the group, for example, Without question, there are additional psychological forces that have contributed to the Brexit, Sanders, and Trump surprises (not to mention the political ones). Our tendency to focus on the present and our commitment to upholding the group, for example, are two other tendencies that are both clearly at work . It would be wrong, too, to paint the policies of a candidate like Sanders and those of somebody like Trump with the same brush.But it's nonetheless true that loss-aversion is the obvious common thread tying these calls for radical change together.Brexit has come and gone, and Sanders has bowed out to endorse Clinton. Much of the rest of the U.S. presidential campaign will revolve around how the candidates frame themselves and their opponents. But the past year in politics has made one thing abundantly clear: If most voters see the status quo as a loss, the Clinton camp may be making things harder for its candidate than necessary.As recently as last month, As recently as last month, Clinton framed Trump as too risky and too negative, saying:We cannot put the safety of our children and grandchildren in Donald Trump's hands. We cannot let him roll the dice with America.This approach may fall on deaf ears among undecided voters who believe things are headed the wrong direction already. To them, such a risk isn\u2019t as off-putting as Clinton might think.There\u2019s a lot that can and will unfold before the election comes to a close in November. By my reckoning, much of what happens will depend on how undecided voters see the status quo\u2014and how the candidates choose to tap into our natural aversion to losses. But for now, anyway, it's pretty clear what's working.Bob Nease is the former chief scientist of Express Scripts, and the author of The Power of Fifty Bits: The New Science of Turning Good Intentions into Positive Results (HarperCollins) as well as over 70 peer-reviewed papers.

But What She\u2018s Holding Is a Mystery", "context": "A tiny coffin with the preserved body of a three-year-old girl is probably one of the last things these workers expected to find when renovating a San Francisco home. But what made this discovery even more puzzling is what the little child was still clutching in her remarkably unspoiled hands.It all started when Ericka Karner decided to remodel her childhood home in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District. Karner was not actually around at the time, however, as she had moved to Idaho to live with family members while the work took place.But, as construction workers arrived at the house, there was no indication that this job would be any different from others that they\u2019d done before. That said, this perception quickly changed not long after they began their work.Indeed, on May 9, 2016, three feet beneath the floor of the garage, the workers\u2019 shovels hit something solid. So, instead of soldiering on, they took the time to excavate the object, and they couldn\u2019t believe what they were seeing: it was a miniature coffin, about three feet in length.The two glass windows of the metal coffin unveiled the face of a little girl with pale skin and blond hair. Despite having been buried for a long time, though, the corpse looked amazingly well preserved.And, upon further examination, the workers identified one more interesting detail: the girl was clutching a red rose in her hands. As one of the discoverers later told KTVU, \"There were flowers \u2013 roses, still on the child\u2019s body. It was a sight to see.\"The workers immediately contacted Karner by phone, informing her of the eerie find. The news was, quite understandably, a little creepy, but Karner did the right thing by contacting the medical examiner to open the casket and identify the body.The coroner who arrived on the scene estimated the girl to be about three years old and reckoned she had been buried sometime around the 1870s. It also became apparent that it was likely she was laid to rest at Odd Fellows Cemetery before it was shut down in 1890.In fact, most of the bodies from this cemetery were moved to a burial plot in the nearby town of Colma during the 1930s to allow for the construction of homes in the area. But, for whatever reason, this young girl was forgotten.And while the mystery made for an interesting story, Karner was soon told that the body was her problem because the girl had already been properly buried \u2013 so it wasn\u2019t classed as an abandoned corpse. This meant that the city wouldn\u2019t take responsibility for it. Worse still, Karner was informed that she would need a death certificate for the unidentified girl if she wanted to give her a proper reburial.Karner was understandably upset about the decision. As she told a newspaper, \"It didn\u2019t seem right. The city decided to move all these bodies 100 years ago, and they should stand behind their decision.\"While several parties came forward with offers to bury the girl, the invitation came with a steep price tag. Indeed, one undertaker asked for $7,000 for the service, while an archaeological company asked for $22,000.To make matters worse, the body was now beginning to deteriorate, since the seal that protected it from the air outside had been broken during the coroner\u2019s examination. Certainly, the coffin spent so much time in Karner\u2019s custody that her two daughters even decided to name the little girl \u2013 Miranda.It wasn\u2019t until city officials did some research that an alternative option was finally devised. They told Karner to contact the Garden of Innocence, a Californian non-profit that helps give unidentified and abandoned children decent burials.Elissa Davey, the founder of the organization, immediately had the coffin moved to refrigerated storage \u2013 until they could figure out where and when to bury Miranda. \"That girl was somebody\u2019s child,\" she explained. \"We had to pick her up.\"A genealogist by trade, Davey opened the Garden in 1998 after hearing the story of a local infant who had died after being abandoned. She couldn\u2019t get the story out of her head, and she decided to contact the coroner to claim the boy and give him a proper burial.Since then, the Garden of Innocence has laid to rest almost 300 unidentified children. And, far from just burying them in a casket, each child is also given an official memorial service that can be attended by local residents.Miranda herself was finally given a burial ceremony on June 4, 2016, in Colma\u2019s Greenlawn Memorial Park. Her casket was carried in by fully-uniformed members of the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic organization dedicated to charity that partners with the Garden.The ceremony lasted for an hour, with some 100 people gathering to mourn and pay their respects to the seemingly forgotten child. As the coffin was lowered into the ground, Miranda could finally rest in peace after 145 years of being lost.Miranda\u2019s DNA was tested before the funeral, and that may lead to her true identity being discovered in the future.

Waldinger sat down with TEDxBeaconStreet to discuss what makes \"the good life,\" according to a 75-year-long research project he is now leading. (TEDxBeaconStreet, Photo: Dave Rezendes)My grandmother once told me this little story that stuck with me. One afternoon at a doctor\u2019s appointment, her doctor moved her large purse to another chair and remarked how heavy it was. \"You must be very rich,\" he said to her. \"I am,\" she said affirmatively.My grandparents lived modestly, still in the narrow two-bedroom rowhouse where she\u2019d raised her family since her husband returned from World War II. They didn\u2019t travel, eat lavish meals or shop at the finest department stores. Neither had careers that followed their passions. (She would have been an amazing teacher, he an exquisite artist.) Yet, she genuinely considered herself rich because she had a husband, children and grandchildren whom she adored.My grandmother knew what Harvard researchers have since confirmed: Relationships are the key to a happy life.[Your relationships are just as important to your health as diet and exercise]Robert Waldinger, a Harvard psychiatrist, took over the more than 75-year-long Grant Study in 2003, becoming the fourth person to run it. He recently gave a TedTalk on it that has been viewed more than 6.5 million times since November 2015.Waldinger felt it was important to do it. The federal government had spent millions on the study for decades, but everyday taxpayers didn\u2019t really know what was discovered.And there\u2019s certainly an appetite for knowing what makes a good life.The longest study of human development, the ongoing Grant Study is a decades-long project that began following the lives of Harvard University men selected in 1938 \u2013 among them President John F. Kennedy and former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee \u2013 and tracked every aspect of their lives. In the 1970s, that study teamed with a similar one that had been following a group of young men from inner-city Boston tenements since the 1940s. That has allowed them to contrast social status and upbringings, but otherwise everyone in the study is a white male.Periodically the men\u2019s physical and emotional well-being are assessed. Recently that has included genetic testing. Many conclusions have been gleaned from monitoring these lives from young adult through old age, but to Waldinger there\u2019s one clear takeaway: The happiest and healthiest participants in both groups were the ones who maintained close, intimate relationships.Waldinger, an Iowan who went to Harvard for undergrad and never left, has known the answer for years. He\u2019s studied relationships his whole career and brought that perspective with him to the study. His first grant proposal as director was to invite the wives of the men \u2013 those still alive then in their 80s \u2013 to examine the impact of marriages on physical health.Those satisfied in their relationships were happier and healthier. It was that simple.\"People who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy, their health declines earlier in midlife, their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely,\" Waldinger said in his TedTalk. \"And good, close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.\"Waldinger wants people to realize that the commercial projection of a good life \u2013 wealth, fame, career success \u2013 won\u2019t bring them health or happiness. It\u2019s the work they put into maintaining connections with other human beings that will.Quality and intimacy, as well as stability and consistency also matter. Casual relationships, like the ones forged on social media won\u2019t do; neither will contentious ones like an abusive marriage or an unreliable friend.Most of the men in the late 1930s believed career achievement equated a good life. But Waldinger says it\u2019s just as important to work harder on relationships. And for personal happiness, more so.Since doing the TedTalk, Waldinger has received hundreds of emails. He\u2019s started a blog to continue the conversation about what makes a good life.He said messages range from, \"I always knew it was true, but look around and people act like it\u2019s not what is important,\" to \"What if you are totally alone and have no one in your life?\"To the latter he recommends they seek out ways to connect with other people, perhaps by volunteering to help people who are lonely, like the elderly.\"It\u2019s useful to know it\u2019s a choice worth making,\" he said.His research has inspired him to make his own changes. In his field, there is a lot of pressure to continue researching and publishing. But he\u2019s realized that it\u2019s his role as teacher \u2013 the connection between mentor and student \u2013 that is more satisfying, so he\u2019s invested more time in that.It has also spurred him to consciously reach out more to friends who are sick or struggling, even if it feels uncomfortable, because he knows how much that connection will mean to them.\"What we\u2019d really like is a quick fix, something we can get that\u2019ll make our lives good and keep them that way,\" Waldinger said in his TedTalk. \"Relationships are messy and they\u2019re complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends, it\u2019s not sexy or glamorous.

Doctors are actively debating how low blood pressure should go in order to protect against heart attacks and stroke, and researchers are focusing on what people can do to keep their levels healthy.Now, in a new study published in the journal Hypertension, scientists report on an unexpected connection to blood pressure: air pollution. The Chinese researchers, led by Yuanyuan Cai from Sun Yat-Sen University, analyzed all available studies involving air pollution and blood pressure and found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants, including ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide, were more likely to have high blood pressure\u2014readings above 140 mm Hg for the first number in the ratio\u2014than those exposed to lower amounts of pollutants. Exposure to particulates, the tiny, hard-to-see particles of pollutants circulating the air, also contribute to higher blood pressures.The effect held for both short-term and long-term exposure to the pollution, and the increased risk of hypertension remained strong even after the researchers adjusted for other factors that could contribute to elevated blood pressure, including a history of heart problems and higher BMI.More research is needed, as the findings are the first to look at both short-term and more lasting effects of pollution on blood pressure. It\u2019s not clear yet, for example, whether people who already have hypertension will experience even higher elevations if they live in polluted areas.

The findings should start a conversation about how legislators and regulators can start to improve air quality and potentially lead to better health for people, she says. In the meantime, doctors can \"remind the population about the dangers of hypertension by advising them to lower the salt in their meals, cook in a healthier way and exercise.\" On top of that, Daviglus adds, it might be a good idea to limit exposure to air pollutants by not going outside on days with high levels of pollution.", "answers": {"answer_start": [448], "text": ["air pollution"]}, "id": "4lz1fo"}, {"question": "Ghetto talent", "context": "Ajegunle is known for being one of Lagos' toughest, most dangerous slums, but it also has another reputation - for producing some of Nigeria's top footballers. So what's the secret to its unlikely success?For a football-obsessed nation like Nigeria, talent can be found in every corner, but there's definitely something special about Ajegunle, or AJ City, as it's known by locals.Since the early 1990s, Ajegunle has been churning out football talent. Famous names such as Taribo West, Odion Ighalo, Brown Ideye, Samson Siasia, Obafemi Martins, Taribo West and Jonathan Akpoborie all started here.Life is not easy for many of the residents of this sprawling ghetto.They have to contend with high crime rates, as well the absence of running water, grid-powered electricity or healthcare.So what are the factors that contribute to Ajegunley's footballing pedigree? Diversity, for one.\"It's a community with so many people from different ethnicities,\" says Bennedict Ehenemba, a football scout for German clubs who is a native of Ajegunle.\"Ajegunle accommodates the Yorubas, the Igbos, the Hausas, the Itsekiris and all the other tribes in Nigeria.\"It's a raw talent hub of Nigeria,\" he tells me.Many success stories can be traced back to two local institutions - St Mary's Catholic Church and the Navy Barracks Camp.They remain safe places for many young people to play the game.Other open spaces are often claimed by so-called \"Area Boys\", unruly gangs who often demand a fee for people to play there.Super Eagles striker Jonathan Akpoborie, who made his name in Germany's Bundesliga in the 1990s, also honed his skills here.\"This is actually the home of football in Nigeria,\" Akpoborie tells me, adding that the game is seen by many youngsters as a route to a better life.\"I don't want to downgrade the area by attributing the success of footballers to poverty but there's just nothing to do for the kids.\"They spend most of their time here playing football and in so doing they develop themselves and naturally become gifted footballers.\"In one national team there's always one player who originated from Ajegunle.\"It's exactly how I started - the grown-ups play first, we watch them play, then eventually we get in the field. They were inspirational to us.\"The slum also has an established system of grassroots football, which encourages talented youngsters to play competitive football for local clubs at an early age.This often gives them an edge over players at competing academies across the country.Alfred Emuejeraye, who plies his trade in the Swiss lower leagues, also grew up in Ajegunle.He believes the secret of the slum lies in its deep love of the game.\"The people here, the community are passionate about football, passionate about everything and are driven to succeed in whatever they do from musicians to taxi drivers... It's an all-round community,\" he tells me.Odion Ighalo - formerly of Watford FC in the English Premier League but now playing for Chinese Super League outfit Changchun Yatai FC - is another Ajegunle native.Now he lives in some of the world's biggest cities, but still remembers Ajegunle fondly.\"It was very tough growing up there. It's not like in Europe where you have everything provided.\"You have to look for money to buy football shoes, jerseys, transport and even water for to drink after training. If you can't afford the transport then you stay - and those who stay are great players,\" says Ighalo.Bolarinwa Olajide is a sports reporter with Lagos-based radio station Wazobia. He saw many of these players emerge from Ajegunle over the years.\"We see the hopeless, those who know they have a talent but they can't exhibit it anywhere. They can't afford fees to join a football academy, so they go to Ajegunle because they know scouts come to watch them play, and it's a chance to show what they can do as footballers,\" he tells me.Leicester City and Nigeria midfielder Wilfred Ndidi did not grow up in Ajegunle but played against boys from the slum during his time at an academy in Lagos.He believes Ajegunle has produced good football players because the boys there \"work hard, the lifestyle is difficult so they try to work very hard and come out with their best.\"To keep the Ajegunle legacy going, some of the footballers are already giving back to the community with projects to nurture future talent.Akpoborie is helping to identify future football talent, while Ighalo is building an orphanage in the heart of the slum.North Korea attempts a new launch which is believed to have failed, South Korea's military says.", "answers": {"answer_start": [0], "text": ["Ajegunle"]}, "id": "853393277009133568"}, {"question": "Find out what Prince George is called at preschool", "context": "Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Prince George of Cambridge arrive at the Lindo Wing after Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to a baby girl at St Mary's Hospital on May 2, 2015 in London, England.Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Prince George of Cambridge arrive at the Lindo Wing after Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to a baby girl at St Mary's Hospital on May 2, 2015 in London, England.

That left foot has done more for world football than the whole of England\u2019s national team, and this bearer of the one-ring went and got a very ugly tattoo, of a sword enveloped in wings, with a soccer ball on one side and the No. 10 on the other. It was seeing an amateur graffiti artist tag his stupid nickname on Christ\u2019s burial cave. If it had been up to me (and it should have been) I would have summoned that tattoo artist to the highest court in the land and had him tried as the unapologetic hooligan that he is.Next, he had a son named Thiago and tattooed the boy\u2019s handprints and his name on the back of that same leg.

He could have been saved. Then the bastard went and grew out that disgusting beard.First of all, Messi is an ugly person. That\u2019s OK, we can admit that.

What you see inside the microwave now doesn't resemble that bar of soap in the slightest, but this isn't some sort of magic trick. You're still looking at Ivory soap \u2014 the air molecules have just expanded and a transformation has occurred. This is the result of Charles' law.. In fact, he was the first individual to take to the air via a hydrogen-filled balloon in 1783, though there's no clear answer as to how high he rose and how long he was in the air. This is certainly a memorable feat, but what the Frenchman is perhaps best known for is his work that later became Charles' law. Jacques Charles was a French scientist and inventor whose most notable work came during the late 18th century. Charles was presumably the first to discover that hydrogen could be used as a lifting agent in balloons, according to the ChemTeamCharles' law, or the law of volumes, simply states that a gas tends to expand when heat is applied to it. This law was published in 1802 by French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, who credited Charles for all his work on the subject, the ChemTeam reports. So, because Ivory soap is full of air molecules, it begins to expand when placed in the microwave. It's a pretty fascinating watch, as the bar of soap will writhe and wriggle until it nearly takes up the entire space. For those of you wondering, the soap can still be used afterward, it'll just be delicate and a bit flaky.This BuzzFeed-produced video features a few other science experiments that are great to do at home \u2014 especially if you have curious children around.

The exact path they take, from Anchorage to the town of Nome, varies slightly from year to year, but the course length is unofficially listed as 1,049 miles\u2014about the distance from Memphis, Tennessee, to New York City.This grueling race has proved deadly to dogs for many years. Dog deaths are so common during the race that Rule 42 of the official Iditarod rules blithely acknowledges that some dogs\u2019 deaths may be considered \"unpreventable.\" How then, in good conscience, in 2017, can an event known to cause animals to suffer and die be celebrated?As the 2017 Iditarod approaches, it\u2019s important to remember the dogs who are injured and killed as well as disturbing facts about the race:At least 27 dogs used in the Iditarod have died just since 2004. In 2016, Nash died after being hit by a snowmobile during the race. In 2015, dogs Stiffy and Wyatt both died on the trail, and a dog named Stuart got loose and was later hit by a car.Countless dogs are injured. In 2015, they included dogs used by musher Yuka Honda, who crashed into a sled and was then run over by another\u2013and Laura, a 5-year-old dog who, according to news reports, was essentially \"blind\" and often seemed \"confused\" but was forced to race anyway by Kelly Maixner.Dogs used in the Iditarod are forced to run up to 100 miles a day through biting winds, blinding snowstorms, subzero temperatures, and treacherous ice. Even with snow booties on some, the dogs\u2019 feet can become cut, bruised, and raw from the vast distances of frozen terrain that they cover.The official Iditarod rules require only that the dogs be provided with a total of 40 hours of rest\u2014even though the race can take up to two weeks. Most states have laws that prohibit overdriving or overworking animals, but Alaska does not.Dogs suffer out of sight off the trail, too. The vast majority of dogs used in sledding are kept chained up, with only overturned barrels or dilapidated doghouses for shelter. Dogs who aren\u2019t the best runners are often treated like defective equipment. Dogs have been beaten, shot, abandoned to starve, or left at already overburdened animal shelters.Official race rules actually forbid mushers from saying anything negative about the race\u2014and not just during their run but for an additional 45 days after they\u2019ve crossed the finish line. Recent years have brought poor (and dangerous) trail conditions that posed a significant risk of injury to both humans and canines involved in the race, and this gag order has likely been placed in an attempt to keep concerns about such issues quiet. In their own words, Iditarod organizers declared that mushers \"shall not make public statements or engage in any public conduct injurious to and in reckless disregard of the best interests of the Race. This includes public statements or acts which are disparaging to any of the sponsors of that year\u2019s Race.\" With rules in place to protect financial sponsors, it would appear that the business interests of race organizers trump concern for the health and safety of the dogs being used in this deadly event.Dogs deserve far better than a lifetime of isolation, cruelty, suffering, and death on the Iditarod trail.Animals all over the world continue to suffer in cruel, archaic \"sporting\" events.

Paleontologists know a good deal about the \"tyrant lizard\" and its ecosystem in North America, just as they know lots about the Late Jurassic period, the time of such famous dinos as Allosaurus, Apatosaurus and Stegosaurus, Zanno said. But between the two, there's a 60-million-year gap. [Image Gallery: The Life of T. Rex]\"There's a huge gap in our understanding of what lived in between those two really unique dinosaur ecosystems,\" Zanno said.For that reason, Zanno and her colleagues focused on 98-million-year-old rocks, right in the middle of that gap. As they excavated Siets from these rocks, they quickly realized they had something good. Two-legged theropod dinosaurs like T. rex have thin-walled bones. The Siats specimen shared this feature.At the time Siats reigned, T. rex had not yet evolved. Its tyrannosaur ancestors were scrawny things, no bigger than large dogs, Zanno said. At some point in the Late Cretaceous, Siats went extinct, clearing the ecosystem of its top predator and giving tyrannosaurs the room to evolve into giants like the recently discovered Lythronax and T. rex.Lost worldSiats (pronounced see-atch) was a bruiser. The bones Zanno discovered belong to a juvenile, and conservative estimates suggest it was about 30 feet (10 meters) long and weighed 9,000 lbs. (4,000 kilograms). An adult would have put on another couple thousand pounds, Zanno said. [25 Amazing Ancient Beasts]\"It's gigantic,\" she said.T. rex, at twice that weight, is still the undisputed giant of North American Cretaceous predators, but Siats is in the running for the No. 2 spot with another carcharodontosaur, Acrocanthosaurus, Zanno said.Acrocanthosauruslived about 10 million years before Siats, and Siats is in a different branch of the carcharodontosaur family, the Neovenatoridae. This is the first time a member of the Neovenatoridae has been found in North America.In Siats' day, what is now Utah was marshy and wet, positioned along the coast of the Western Interior Seaway, a shallow sea that once bisected North America.The researchers recovered most of Siats' backbone and tail, along with portions of its hip and back leg.

Or they might be really pissed off.In its 2017 budget request, NASA asked Congress for $1.3 billion to build its next jumbo rocket. Last week, despite years of fighting with the Obama Administration over its plans to explore an asteroid with the rocket, the Senate Appropriations Committee not only granted the request, but gave the space agency an extra $995 million to build it.A surprise billion dollars may sound good. But while adding money to \"Space Operations,\" the Appropriations Committee also cut $660 million from NASA\u2019s science, aeronautics, and space technology programs that build the telescopes, observatories, planes, and landers that make the agency so beloved. In justifying this decision, the committee wrote that the rocket \"is the nation\u2019s launch vehicle that will enable humans to explore space beyond current capabilities.\"The futuristic space rocket, called the Space Launch System (SLS), won\u2019t send any astronauts into space until at least 2023, and it doesn\u2019t even have a destination. But that doesn\u2019t seem to matter to lawmakers. Since the moon landings ended, NASA is and has always been a jobs program, more about dollars spent on the ground than discoveries made among the stars, with the SLS bonanza just the latest example.\"It is more the politics of pork than the politics of progress,\" former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver told BuzzFeed News. \"There\u2019s a long-time pattern at NASA where money aimed at science and research ends up with builders and contractors instead.\"Ratana Meekham, a technician at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama NASA / Via nasa.gov ID: 8562047The Senate space spending committee is headed by Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, and on the minority side by Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, both of whom have NASA centers in their states. The SLS (nicknamed the \"Senate Launch System\" after it was forced on NASA in 2010), will be built at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama, where a $45 million 15-story test stand for the rocket reached its intended height earlier this month.\"The point is to spend money and create jobs the way the Soviet Union did on its rocket design bureaus,\" Keith Cowing of NASA Watch told BuzzFeed News. The SLS \u2014 \"a rocket to nowhere,\" as Cowing put it \u2014 fits this pattern neatly because it provides thousands of jobs in space states. No one knows where it will go. Maybe to an asteroid (the Obama administration\u2019s unloved notion), or to circle the moon, or boost astronauts on their way to Mars.Eric Berger, a reporter at Ars Technica decried the move to build the rocket ahead of a destination. Cuts also came to NASA\u2019s \"space technology\" funding, a $130 million bite meant to keep aloft earth-observing satellites run out of Goddard Space Flight Center, based in Mikulski\u2019s state of Maryland. As Berger said, \"the motivation seems primarily to be keeping people employed.\"One problem with this approach is that you might end up with space rocket that doesn\u2019t have any space technology \u2014 a habitat module, deep-space propulsion, landers \u2014 to actually let astronauts voyage to asteroids, or the moon, or Mars. You might spend billions on workers who maintain the rocket you\u2019ve built, and not have any money left over to build the interplanetary survival gear needed to ever get to Mars, the ultimate goal of the space agency.It\u2019s happened before, Garver said, with the the $100 billion International Space Station. \"We had to spend all the money just to get it built, with very little left for science.\" Scientists have long complained how little research takes place on the orbiting lab. NASA\u2019s scientific advisory committee decided only this month to send a fact-finding group to the foundation that manages ISS research, after questioning its scientific productivity.NASA Watch / Keith Cowing / Via nasawatch.com ID: 8562044\"The critics are right, this isn\u2019t a rational way to run a space program,\" political science professor Harry Lambright of Syracuse University told BuzzFeed News. \"But that doesn\u2019t matter, because this is the way a space program will inevitably work in a democracy.\"So it has always been for NASA, born in a moment of Cold War lunacy over the Soviet Union claiming the moon for communism, and looking for another space race to justify its budget ever since the glamour of Moon landings first wore off.In the 1960s, NASA administrator James Webb faced declining popular interest in the moon landing, responded by spreading NASA centers to politically important states, such as Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Texas, California, Ohio, and Florida. NASA\u2019s Stennis Space Center, which will build the rocket engines powering the SLS, is located in Mississippi, home to the chairman of the Senate\u2019s overall spending committee, Sen. Thad Cochran. In a sense, that system is still working.NASA built the space shuttle in the 1970s in a decision largely shaped by Richard Nixon\u2019s reelection campaign. Since then, the space agency has had to compete for Congressional dollars like every other federal agency, which means that politicians will always look to jobs as a reason for any Mars landings, Lambright said. \"They can\u2019t spend money that Congress doesn\u2019t give them.\"So, NASA will at least get a rocket out of the deal, he and others argue. \"NASA is actually doing a very good job, in my view, of navigating to build a rocket while they can,\" Lambright said. \"That is what there is money to build.\"The real problem, former NASA official Scott Pace of George Washington University told BuzzFeed News, is that the Obama administration\u2019s plans to fly astronauts to an asteroid and then Mars are not very interesting to international or commercial partners, who would rather return to the moon. Building SLS lets NASA keep its options open if the next president decides to look to lunar landings instead, something that Obama seemed to rule out in a 2010 speech.Meanwhile, one commercial partner of NASA appears very much interested in Mars. SpaceX has announced that it will land an unmanned Dragon astronaut capsule on the Red Planet as early as 2018.

According to police reports, efforts to resuscitate Gandolfini were well underway when the theft allegedly occurred.Gandolfini, 51, suffered a massive heart attack while in the master bathroom of the suite he shared with his son as they waited for the arrival of wife Deborah Lin, who was set to join them on an Italian holiday before the actor was scheduled to be a keynote speaker at the Taormina Film Festival in Sicily.Gandolfini was still alive when he was taken to the Policlinico Umberto I hospital in Rome, but died shortly after arrival. Bevilacqua is not being charged with medical malpractice and is not believed to have impeded efforts to save the dying star.Members of Gandolfini\u2019s family noted that the watch was missing and reported it to authorities and to their insurance company. An Italian police investigation into the alleged theft included surveillance-camera footage from the hotel corridor and testimony from two hotel security personnel, who told investigators that Gandolfini was not wearing the watch when he was removed from the luxury hotel.

Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty ImagesIt\u2019s easier than you might think to get what you want out of someone you don\u2019t know very well, or even at all \u2014 as Science of Us has previously written, research has shown people tend to underestimate strangers\u2019 willingness to help them out, even when the request is inconvenient or weird. This is especially true if you ask them a second time, which makes it that much more awkward to refuse.Even so, it never hurts to stack the deck in your favor. And some research suggests that when you\u2019re thinking about how to phrase your ask, there may be a magic word that makes it seem that much more doable: willing. As in, \"Are you willing to do XYZ?\"Psychologist Elizabeth Stokoe, a professor of social interaction at Loughborough University in the U.K., specializes in conversational analysis, recording and transcribing everyday verbal exchanges to try and understand their linguistic and social components.

Yes or no. What was really interesting about the mediation \"willings\" is that if you ask someone \"Are you interested in mediation?\" they might say yes or no. But if you ask them if they\u2019re willing to mediate, that requires them saying something about the type of person that they are.That particular phrasing, in other words, tweaks the nature of the ask \u2014 a question that was formerly about an immediate action is now about a person\u2019s boundaries, what they can find doable or palatable in a broader sense. \"So, if we change words, we change outcomes,\" she said (the full transcript of her talk is online at BPS Research Digest).With a caveat: \"\u2018Willing\u2019 works best after resistance, so it shouldn\u2019t be your opening gambit,\" she said.

It stripped the air of oxygen, suffocating 1,746 villagers and 3,000 animals to death.This may sound like a scary movie plot, but for the thousands affected, it was a very real nightmare. A hydrovolcanic eruption 400 years earlier created a crater in the lake, where massive amounts of carbon dioxide built up over the centuries. Volcanic rumblings continued miles below the surface, with gas seeping into the groundwater to create \"CO 2 -charged soda springs\" that bled into the lake, says Dr. George Kling, a biologist at the University of Michigan.When that cap is removed, it explodes like a warm, shaken Coke.The problem with CO 2 is that it builds up, \"like in a soda bottle,\" Kling says. No one can see the pressure building as long as the cap \u2014 in this case, the weight of the water \u2014 stays put and forces the gas to dissolve or be submerged. But when that cap is removed, it explodes like a warm, shaken Coke, with bubbles rising to the surface and a giant burst of CO 2 escaping into the atmosphere.Triggering the pressure\u2019s release can be as simple as heavy rain or an earthquake. In Nyos, some boulders and dirt were the likely culprits, and Kling says he found evidence of a \"very large and recent landslide\" when he visited after the disaster. Dr. Njilah Isaac Konfor, a disaster-management and groundwater expert at the University of Yaounde in Cameroon, says there were reports of a week of rain before the event.Luckily, there are just three known lakes worldwide with these properties, and only two of these limnic eruptions have occurred in recorded history. The first was a much smaller explosion at Lake Monoun, also in Cameroon, that killed 37. It took place two years earlier, almost to the day, just 19 miles away from Lake Nyos. Volcanologists and engineers, Kling says, have been working to eliminate the CO 2 risk there ever since via six-inch pipes that pump out the gas.While \"unlikely,\" according to Dr. Greg Tanyileke of the Cameroonian Institute for Geological and Mining Research and the chief government scientist working on the lake, Lake Nyos could suffer another deadly eruption. Warding off such a calamity is an ongoing process, he says. Kling adds that, despite efforts to warn locals and help them make \"informed choices,\" many have returned to their homes and farmland because the soil there is so fertile, and farming is critical to their rural existence.But CO 2 isn\u2019t the only problem. There\u2019s also a rickety natural dam made of volcanic ash and rock at one part of the crater. If it collapses, the top 130 feet of the lake could come crashing down, causing a flood that \"would reach Nigeria\" and endanger 5,000 people, Kling says. Even worse, this could cause another imbalance in the lake and possibly unleash any remaining carbon dioxide still suppressed at the bottom. This \"double-whammy threat,\" as Kling calls it, is being addressed by an expensive but essential dam-strengthening project that is nearing completion.Even if Cameroon\u2019s lakes are no longer a threat, scientists have their eyes on a far bigger lake in Central Africa with similar attributes. Lake Kivu, which lies on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, is 1,600 times larger than Nyos and contains 1,000 times more gas. It also sits on the Albertine Rift, where it is enduring increasing volcanic activity. This, combined with the fact that it has gas levels high enough to kill two million people along its shores if there\u2019s a limnic eruption, makes it what Kling calls the \"largest ticking time bomb in the world.\"And scientists haven\u2019t settled on what can be done to avert the danger. The lake is so big that the methods used to degas Cameroon\u2019s bodies of water simply won\u2019t work. Instead, the Rwandan government is trying to prevent a disaster and capitalize on the natural gas \u2014 the fifth largest methane deposit in the world \u2014 by carefully harvesting the deposits for electricity.

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.Saying I'm not fashionable is an understatement.It's not that I don't understand that certain colors or patterns do or don't go together, but I see clothing from a utilitarian point of view.If it fits and doesn't seem objectionable, I'll wear it. If what I'm wearing catches people's eye (in a good way), I consider it to be a bonus.That said, I know a lot of people don't share that opinion, which is why I turned to Trunk Club, a service that combines personal shopping with the mechanics of a subscription box.Here's how it works: Trunk Club pairs you with a personal stylist who asks you a series of questions over e-mail. After you establish your budget, style, sizes, and which pieces you're looking for, your stylist puts together a \"trunk\" full of clothes for you. Before it's shipped, you're shown an itemized list (with photos) of what the stylist has picked out. If you see something you don't like, you can ask them not to ship that piece, and it'll get replaced with another option.The consultation process is very professional and straightforward, which is great since it's not something I'm used to. It's also remarkably quick; I spoke to my stylist on a Wednesday, and the clothes were shipped to me that Saturday.Once you receive your clothes, you're given a few days to try everything on and see which pieces you like enough to keep. I've always hated trying clothes on at a store because I always felt rushed, but that wasn't a problem here. I was also able to mix and match pieces from Trunk Club with my entire closet's worth of clothes, a luxury I didn't get when shopping for clothes traditionally.I found a few pieces I liked (and learned what gingham meant), and sent the clothes I didn't like back in the original trunk. Shipping is free both ways, and a return label is included in your trunk; and you only pay for the clothes you keep. My stylist called me to discuss which pieces I did and didn't like and I was sent a follow-up trunk, which included clothes that were even more tailored to my taste.What sets Trunk Club apart from a clothing subscription service is that there's no monthly, quarterly, or annual fee. You only get trunks when you request them, which is a nice departure from other services I've tried. I liked my stylist, never felt pressured to keep more clothing than I wanted, and didn't feel like I was being talked down to as a someone who doesn't know a lot about fashion.It's not a cheap service (expect the prices to be in line with upscale retail stores), but I definitely found some value in it. In addition to learning about gingham, I also learned I loved wearing chinos and what a really nice belt looked and felt like. Patterns, styles, and materials may be obvious to people who really like fashion, but to an outsider like me, these were new, valuable insights.Using Trunk Club made me a little more conscious about fashion, and I was able to add fresh pieces to my wardrobe with almost no effort. If either of those prospects sound appealing to you, I recommend you give Trunk Club a try.

The Clinton campaign tried to shrug this off saying that every presidential motorcade has an ambulance. That is simply not true. I have never seen an ambulance tagging along in a presidential motorcade. It is bad optics and makes a leader look weak. If you will remember, when Reagan was shot, one of his men had to drive him to a hospital.What gave me pause here was InfoWars. But Paul Watson is a good writer and a fairly reliable source there unlike some of the others. He says they had a reporter in Cleveland who saw the ambulance and a gurney being wheeled out. The EMS workers were in bullet proof vests. You can see it for yourself in the video below. The only rational explanation here is that it was a precaution for Hillary Clinton. We know she has something wrong with her and she won\u2019t release her medical records. Anyone with eyes in their head can see she is not well.From InfoWars:EMS workers wearing bullet proof vests who had been traveling in an ambulance that was part of Hillary Clinton\u2019s motorcade in Cleveland, Ohio earlier this week were caught on camera wheeling out a hospital bed, prompting more questions as to the state of Hillary\u2019s health. Hillary suffered a four minute coughing fit during the event which prompted national headlines and an attempt by the Clinton campaign to pressure the media into not reporting on future episodes of Hillary\u2019s ill health. Infowars reporter Millie Weaver reported how she was intrigued to see the EMS workers traveling with Hillary given all the questions about her health. \"I\u2019m standing there waiting for Hillary to come out of her tent and the event was already running over an hour behind, so I had a feeling something was wrong, that maybe she was sick....and sure enough I turn right around and there is a gurney and there\u2019s these EMS workers bit they are wearing what looks like bullet proof vests,\" said Weaver.The men seen in the video wheeling out the gurney emerged from the same ambulance that had been part of Hillary\u2019s motorcade, according to Weaver and her cameraman. \"They were staged right behind stage waiting in the event that maybe she might have had something happen or maybe she fainted or fell,\" said Weaver, who noted how Clinton \"sounded so sick in person\" when she finally emerged from the tent to give her cough-addled speech.If this isn\u2019t an indication of Clinton\u2019s health, please explain to me what it is and stop lying about the motorcade.

Developer Games has often claimed that the No Man's Sky universe is persistently online and players all inhabit it. But it has also constantly said because the playing field is so massive (18 quintillion procedurally generated planets), and players initially spawn in completely random areas, the chances of meeting another real human being are \"almost zero\".It certainly didn't expect that to happen on day one.Two players have posted proof on Reddit that they not only spawned close to each other, they set out to meet. And they ended up in exactly the same spot in the game, on the same planet, in the same galaxy, but things didn't quite turn out as expected.Twitch broadcaster TheSadCactus (TheGalacticCactus on Reddit) discovered that a system he visited had already been named by a different player, Psytokat.Whenever a new system or planet is found it can be renamed by the first player to arrive, so he knew that Psytokat else must have travelled through recently (as the game had only been out for a day). He arranged to meet his compatriot nearby and they headed to the same planet.They found a landmark and waited for each other to turn up. Neither did. That is to say, both arrived there but couldn't see each other. What's more, the lighting and area ambience was different.\"We are 100 per cent in the same station same spot and everything and we cannot see each other,\" said TheSadCactus.There are several speculated reasons for this. It could be a glitch, after all the game only went live yesterday and the servers were flooded. It could be that the two players were split into different lobbies online. Or it could be that you actually can't meet other players at all.Hello Games' founder Sean Murray had revealed in the past that it was possible to meet others, even suggesting that other players would be able to tell you what you look like: \"You can't see yourself,\" he told The Late Show's Stephen Colbert. \"The only way to know what you look like is for somebody else to see you.\"But the chances of that are incredibly rare because of the size of what we're building.\"Conspiracy theories aside, we wonder if it really matters.

Microsoft admitted it has been doing user research into this new name, and the company tends to rely on these focus groups far too heavily. \"It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them,\" said former Apple CEO Steve Jobs back in 1998. Relying on these focus groups often results in misguided product decisions. Microsoft used a \"Customer Experience Improvement Program\" as an indicator that the company should scrap the Start button and Start Menu in Windows 8. That terrible decision has been reversed for Windows 10, and feedback opened more broadly.When Microsoft listens, it results in CortanaWhen Microsoft does listen to broader feedback, it usually results in something people actually care about. Take Cortana for example. Microsoft was going to name its digital assistant Naomi, Alyx, or a number of other equally boring alternatives, but leaks and an online petition helped sway Microsoft\u2019s decision. Cortana is such a unique name that it\u2019s on the verge of entering the mainstream thanks to the positivity around the feature and Microsoft\u2019s marketing of it.Microsoft had an opportunity to create the same buzz and excitement around its Internet Explorer successor by getting the name right. When Firefox started swaying people away from Internet Explorer, it did so with a combination of good features, word of mouth, and an awesome red panda taking over the world for its logo and brand.

Income in the United States has gone up over the past decade, but happiness is declining.The United States was 14th in the latest ranking, down from No. 13 last year, and over the years Americans steadily have been rating themselves less happy.\"It's the human things that matter. If the riches make it harder to have frequent and trustworthy relationship between people, is it worth it?\" asked John Helliwell, the lead author of the report and an economist at the University of British Columbia in Canada (ranked No. 7). \"The material can stand in the way of the human.\"Studying happiness may seem frivolous, but serious academics have long been calling for more testing about people's emotional well-being, especially in the United States. In 2013, the National Academy of Sciences issued a report recommending that federal statistics and surveys, which normally deal with income, spending, health and housing, include a few extra questions on happiness because it would lead to better policy that affects people's lives.Norway moved from No. 4 to the top spot in the report's rankings, which combine economic, health and polling data compiled by economists that are averaged over three years from 2014 to 2016. Norway edged past previous champ Denmark, which fell to second. Iceland, Switzerland and Finland round out the top 5.\"Good for them. I don't think Denmark has a monopoly on happiness,\" said Meik Wiking, chief executive officer of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen, who wasn't part of the global scientific study that came out with the rankings.\"What works in the Nordic countries is a sense of community and understanding in the common good,\" Wiking said.Still, you have to have some money to be happy, which is why most of the bottom countries are in desperate poverty. But at a certain point extra money doesn't buy extra happiness, Helliwell and others said.Central African Republic fell to last on the happiness list, and is joined at the bottom by Burundi, Tanzania, Syria and Rwanda.The report ranks 155 countries. The economists have been ranking countries since 2012, but the data used goes back farther so the economists can judge trends.The rankings are based on gross domestic product per person, healthy life expectancy with four factors from global surveys. In those surveys, people give scores from 1 to 10 on how much social support they feel they have if something goes wrong, their freedom to make their own life choices, their sense of how corrupt their society is and how generous they are.While most countries were either getting happier or at least treading water, America's happiness score dropped 5 percent over the past decade. Venezuela and the Central African Republic slipped the most over the past decade. Nicaragua and Latvia increased the most.Study co-author and economist Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University said in a phone interview from Oslo that the sense of community, so strong in Norway, is deteriorating in the United States.\"We're becoming more and more mean spirited.

There were an estimated 12.2 undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in 2007, but the number decreased to 11.3 million by 2009, according to Pew.Pew noted that the increase in its estimate doesn't necessarily mean a huge increase in the undocumented population, or that the trends have definitively reversed. \"Although there are indications the number of unauthorized immigrants may be rising, the 2012 population estimate is the midpoint of a wide range of possible values and in a statistical sense is no different from the 2009 estimate,\" the report reads.After 2007, Pew found that the number of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico -- about half of the total undocumented population in 2012 -- had decreased at higher rates than the general group. There are now about 6.05 million Mexican undocumented immigrants in the U.S., according to the Pew 2012 estimate.Jeffrey S. Passel, a senior demographer at Pew, explains how researchers estimate the unauthorized population here.It's not clear how many undocumented immigrants would actually seek citizenship if given the chance. Pew put out a report in June noting that although most Hispanic immigrants say they want to become citizens, only 46 percent who currently could become citizens have done so. Nearly half of those who did not become citizens despite eligibility said it was either for personal reasons or administrative ones, such as the high cost, according to a 2012 Pew report. Still, a strong majority -- more than 90 percent -- of Latino immigrants who had not naturalized said then that they would become citizens if they could.The June report also noted that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program -- which grants two years reprieve from deportation concerns to undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children -- saw a sizable number of applications, but not as many as Pew researchers estimated would be eligible.The Senate passed a bill in June that would allow undocumented immigrants to gain legal status and eventual citizenship, but for now, it's not clear the House of Representatives will pass, or even vote on, such a bill this year. Instead, the House may pursue smaller measures to increase border security and enforcement, legalize undocumented young people and change the high-skilled work visa system.Clarification: This piece has been updated to clarify Pew's adjustments to its 2011 numbers subsequent to the publishing of that year's report.

And we're not just talking about the stress. (But it's not all bad news.)It May Make Biological Clocks Tick A Little FasterCity birds have faster reproductive clocks than country birds, found a recent study at the Max Planck Institutes. And the culprit is something that may affect us all: light pollution. Light that was just one-thirtieth the intensity of a streetlamp made songbirds breed earlier and grow bigger gonads. Even a tiny amount of light can suppress sleep-time levels of melatonin -- a well-known antioxidant, explains lead researcher Davide Dominoni. Reduce melatonin levels in our bodies, and free-radicals likely increase -- which age us faster.\" There's also a possibility that nighttime light affects the \"baby clock\" because melatonin keeps sex hormones in check, regulates the ovaries and prevents eggs from maturing too quickly. Science has already proven that room lights and LED screens reduce melatonin and throw our bodies off-sync -- potentially leading to cancer, obesity and infertility, among other health problems. But exactly how \"aging\" is the gentle urban glow that seeps through your blinds? Research is ongoing; in the meantime, sleep shades are looking sexier.It Makes A Touchier AmygdalaImagine yourself in this experiment. You're asked to take a math test in an fMRI machine... and then you overhear the researchers insulting you. How your amygdala, the brain's anxiety trigger, will respond can be predicted by where you live, found researchers at the University of Heidelberg. Rural types had very little amygdala activity; they seemed immune to stress. In small-town residents, the amygdala was moderately active. But in urban dwellers, it was frenzied. One interpretation is that the city wires us for performance anxiety (and neuroses). More optimistically, that jumpy amygdala might help us deal better -- or faster -- in complex social situations. It's the part of the brain that picks up on facial expressions and nuances -- judging, for instance, who's trustworthy or dangerous -- and that's helpful when you regularly encounter hundreds of strangers. In other words, the social stress can be good stress -- it leads to street savvy.It Makes You Burn BrighterTo paraphrase Edna St. Vincent Millay, your candle may be burning at both ends, but it gives a lovelier -- and more creative/efficient/prolific -- light. \"Put two workers with similar skill levels in cities of different densities, and the one in the denser place will be more productive (by 6 to 28 percent),\" reported economics correspondent Ryan Avent in his book The Gated City. He credits the unavoidable rubbing-of-shoulders; the energy that comes from idea-swapping and opportunity-making. All this noisy busy-ness can also make you more creative -- by distracting you just enough to derail one-track thinking, found a study that compared performance in chatty cafe\u0301s with quiet idylls.It Shuts Down Your SensesBack in 1977, in a famously troubling experiment, researchers asked 6- to 10-year-olds to approach strangers and say, \"I'm lost. Can you call my house?\" In small towns, 72 percent of the adults said yes; in cities, just 46 percent. (\"So what's your problem, kid? I'm lost too,\" said a passerby.) One explanation is that urban types tend to believe that the authorities, not individuals, should handle social problems. The other is \"information overload\" -- we shut down when our senses are overstimulated. (Interesting: Noise may be at the heart of the problem. The louder the racket in a similar city-streets experiment, the more people acted unhelpful and \"emotionally deaf.\")It's Calming You Softly... With Its SmogNoise is the biggest urban stressor, found a study at the Tel Aviv University. But one very weird thing appears to offset it: carbon monoxide from car exhaust. Even extremely low levels (approximately 1 to 15 parts per million every half-hour) of the odorless gas had a calming effect on volunteers, who were equipped with heart-rate and pollution monitors and kept track of their stress as they roamed the cityscape. In the loud zones, they felt more Zen when the pollution was higher than average. There were no lasting effects, bad or good. Obviously, this is no reason to sniff tailpipes. While a tiny amount may, strangely, relax us, carbon monoxide is a killer, resulting in about 500 accidental deaths a year.It Programs You To Bloom In Any Green OasisFinally, a breath of fresh air. A 25-minute walk in a city park is all it takes to recover from urban attention fatigue, found Scottish scientists. No surprise that any bit of nature is restorative, but now scientists have proved it by asking volunteers to wear newfangled portable electroencephalograms to measure brain waves. When urbanites strolled into leafy green plazas and parks, their thoughts become expansive, attentive and meditative. More like, well, country folk. A half-mile later, the walkers felt restored; their brain-wave patterns were relaxed.

Sole Foods reopened the site as an urban garden in July, and the formerly vacant lot now has 500 fruit trees that will go a long way toward producing the 60 tons of fresh produce that Sole Foods expects to net this year between its four existing sites.In addition to producing artisan quality fruits and vegetables for local markets and restaurants, Sole Foods aims to employ nontraditional farmers -- individuals, for example, who may have struggled with addiction or mental illness and are looking for ways to turn their lives around.\"This is a production model,\" co-founder Michael Ableman told Global News. \"It\u2019s designed to produce production quantities of food and jobs, two of our primary goals.\"Sounds like a win, win to us.H/T: Reddit/r/UpliftingNews", "answers": {"answer_start": [283], "text": ["for the Vancouver community"]}, "id": "382577420357754881"}, {"question": "Lingerie model: I realize my image contributes to girls' insecurities", "context": "Victoria's Secret models swear by yoga, green juice and lifestyles so beautifully healthy they can be documented on Instagram daily. But living up to the model standard often seems next to impossible -- and one lingerie runway walker is here to tell us that it is.In a refreshingly candid new interview, model Doutzen Kroes admits that even she doesn't fulfill the fantasy in real life -- \"I don't look like that picture,\" she tells The Telegraph:Despite her healthy-eating messages, Kroes is aware of the extra pressure Instagram puts on young women. \"I feel I'm such a big part of that insecurity that some girls might have because of my job, that girls think they have to be that picture. And even boys, they think that that picture exists and it's so frustrating because I don't look like that picture -- I wake up not looking like that picture.\" Occasionally, she will post a picture of herself on a beach without make-up, but she says that people want the fantasy.And living up to that fantasy isn't easy. As Doutzen once put it to Stuff magazine, \"Sometimes it's a struggle to keep up with my own photos, where the lighting is perfect, the makeup is done and the images have been retouched. That's not what I see when I look in the mirror!\"It's a message we've heard from models before -- as Cindy Crawford often says, \"Even I don't wake up looking like Cindy Crawford!\" -- but one that gets lost between the glossy advertisements, shiny magazine covers and retouched photos.And the fantasy image isn't all Photoshop. Revealing her pre-show diet for the famed Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, Doutzen admits that the expectation of a perfectly fit figure extends to the runway, where there is no airbrushing at all: \"For the show, there is no retouching,\" she tells the Telegraph, \"We can't escape from the truth. There are millions of people watching -- and even people watching live -- so it's really important to work out a lot, which I do, and I definitely change my diet.\"That includes no alcohol a month before the show and no sugar (although she will allow herself some carbs). And even then, Doutzen, whose \"bikini body\" is idolized the world over, isn't a sample size.\"I'm not a sample size at all,\" she says. \"At some shows I know they have been using very young girls who have not gone into the change of the body yet -- no hips, no boobs.

I have a woman's body, and once in a while you run into the fact that things are not fitting the way they should be.\"But that's just it -- the items should not have to fit that way.

Gadea fears that one day, the FBI might do to him what it did to Apple in their recent legal battle: Demand that he give the agency access to his encrypted data. Rather than make what he considers a Faustian bargain, he\u2019s building a system that he hopes will avoid the situation entirely.\"We have to keep as little [information] as possible so that even if the government or some other entity wanted access to it, we\u2019d be able to say that we don\u2019t have it,\" said Gadea, founder and chief executive of Envoy. The 30-person company enables businesses to register visitors using iPads instead of handwritten visitor logs. The technology tracks who works at a firm, who visits the firm, and their contact information.In Silicon Valley, there\u2019s a new emphasis on putting up barriers to government requests for data. The Apple-FBI case and its aftermath have tech firms racing to employ a variety of tools that would place customer information beyond the reach of a government-ordered search.The trend is a striking reversal of a long-standing article of faith in the data-hungry tech industry, where everyone from Google to the latest start-up has predicated success on the ability to hoover up as much information as possible about consumers.Now, some large tech firms are increasingly offering services to consumers that rely far less on collecting data. The sea change is even becoming evident among early-stage companies that see holding so much data as more of a liability than an asset, given the risk that cybercriminals or government investigators might come knocking.Previous Slide Next Slide \ue009 Full screen 1/4 SLIDES \u00a9 Nick Otto For The Washington Post Larry Gadea CEO of Envoy works at his desk in his company's San Francisco office. 2/4 SLIDES \u00a9 Nick Otto For The Washington Post A guest registration tablet made by Envoy. 3/4 SLIDES \u00a9 Nick Otto For The Washington Post Employees of Envoy in their San Francisco office. 4/4 SLIDES \u00a9 Nick Otto For The Washington Post Employees at Envoy 4/4 SLIDESStart-ups that once hesitated to invest in security are now repurposing limited resources to build technical systems to shed data, even if it hinders immediate growth.\"Engineers are not inherently anti-government, but they are becoming radicalized, because they believe that the FBI, in particular, and the U.S. government, more broadly, wants to outlaw encryption,\" said prominent venture capitalist Marc Andreessen in a recent interview. Andreessen\u2019s firm, Andreessen Horowitz, is an investor in Envoy.The government abandoned its effort to force Apple to help unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino terrorists and paid professional hackers to crack the phone instead. But experts say the issue is far from settled, and will probably be the subject of court and legislative battles.Start-ups are particularly wary, Andreessen said, of legislation proposed recently by Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that would compel tech companies to build technical methods to share customers\u2019 encrypted data, at a court\u2019s request.\"They believe there\u2019s this window of opportunity that if we build strong encryption now, we can make it a fait accompli. But if we let five years pass, it may never happen,\" Andreessen said.In the past two years, more companies have embraced encryption, which scrambles information so that it looks like a stream of unintelligible characters to an outsider who accessed it without permission. What\u2019s changed more recently, industry officials say, is that companies are encrypting data and throwing away the key to prevent their gaining access, a move which started with Apple but is spreading across the Valley.This latter tactic is the most worrisome to law enforcement. Government officials have said repeatedly they do not want to outlaw encryption; FBI Director James B. Comey has called strong encryption a vital means of protecting the public\u2019s personal information from hackers.But officials insist that there must be a technical means to access that information when companies are served with warrants. Otherwise, there will be \"profound consequences for public safety,\" Comey told Congress in March. Terrorists and criminals are already using messaging services to which tech companies have thrown away the key, he said. Investigators say two such services, WhatsApp and Telegram, were used by terrorists in the Brussels bombings that killed more than 30 people and wounded hundreds.\"This is a Silicon Valley delusion that the government wants to outlaw encryption,\" Stewart A. Baker, a former National Security Agency general counsel, said in an interview. \"I grant that there is a radicalized subculture of engineers that is very prone to that delusion, but it is a delusion.\"Surely not every company will resort to building such systems. Many simply can\u2019t. Their business relies on targeted advertising or the mining of customer data, and cutting off access would be a recipe for failure. But many start-ups that wouldn't have considered it before the Apple FBI fight are now doing so and discussing the accompanying trade-offs, said Bret Taylor, formerly Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer and now chief executive of the start-up Quip.The trade-offs can be significant: Heavy encryption risks slowing down your service. It limits the ability to analyze customer behavior or introduce new features. (Encrypting email, for example, would make it harder to search through email.) Once you give customers the only key to their data, you can\u2019t give them a backup if they lose it.Such efforts among over the last few years have been described as part of an arms race between large tech companies and potential invaders, spurred largely by the growing threat of cyberattacks. To some extent, they\u2019ve also been prompted by a newfound wariness of government after Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations about government surveillance, as well as a growing awareness among entrepreneurs of the sheer sensitivity of the data on their services.Apple led the pack, launching end-to-end encryption with its popular messaging app, iMessage, in 2011. In 2014, the company blocked its own access to information stored on iPhones -- data that disappears permanently after ten failed passcode attempts. (End-to-end encryption enables only the partners trading messages to decode them. The companies providing the means to transmit them cannot.)WhatsApp, the global messaging service owned by Facebook, announced end-to-end encryption this year, as did Viber, a messaging app that is popular in Europe. These years-long technical efforts predated the FBI case. Cloudera and Box, two larger tech start-ups selling data storage and processing systems to large corporations, have built encrypted systems over the past year in which only the customer has the keys needed to unscramble data.The case between Apple and FBI and the possibility of so-called \"backdoor\" legislation \u2014 mandating encryption bypasses for law enforcement \u2014 is a new inflection point. Earlier this month, Google launched Allo, a chat app which allows users to switch on end-to-end encryption, and Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos said he was exploring measures to encrypt data and throw away the keys on devices owned by the Seattle, Wash.-based company.Stealth Worker \u2014 a start-up funded six months ago by the prominent incubator Y-Combinator \u2014 provides contract cybersecurity experts to early-stage start-ups which often operate on a shoestring budget. Stealth Worker\u2019s chief executive Ken Baylor, said that in the past month, he had been approached by a half-dozen companies looking for ways to build tougher encryption and other secure technical architectures. But many don\u2019t want to talk about it, he said.\"They are afraid of a phone-call from someone high up saying that they are unpatriotic,\" Baylor said.Bracket Computing, a 70-person Silicon Valley start-up, embarked on an encryption project about a month ago intended to make it easier for customers to hold the keys to their own data.That way, \"I can\u2019t get subpoenaed the way Apple did,\" Bracket chief executive Tom Gillis said. \"This clears up the whole issue: If you have an issue with my customer, go talk to my customer, don\u2019t talk to me. I\u2019m just a tech guy, and I don\u2019t want to be in the middle of these things.\"Gillis said that initially, customers seeking the ability to hold the keys to their data were large, sophisticated financial services companies, such as Goldman Sachs and Blackstone. Today, a broader array of companies, including media and automotive firms and small banks, are making these requests. Advances in Intel\u2019s chips, he said, have made it possible to build these complex systems 13 times as fast as in 2010.Building systems that cut off a company\u2019s access to customer data is time- and resource-intensive, and these systems don\u2019t come without risks.Envoy CEO Gadea, an engineering prodigy who was hired by Google when he was just 18, estimates that his company\u2019s data-wiping project will take a few months and about three engineers working full time.Currently, when a visitor enters a building with an Envoy registration system, a message is sent alerting the appropriate employee that they have a guest. Envoy can send such messages \u2014 by text, email or other messaging services \u2014 because the customer data is stored on its servers, which are hosted remotely by Amazon Web Services, the cloud division of Amazon. The information is encrypted, but Envoy holds the keys to unscramble it. (Amazon CEO Bezos owns The Washington Post).Under the new protocol, the engineering team will have to reconfigure the system so that the keys to unscramble the data are kept by the customers on the iPads used to sign people in. Envoy will no longer have the ability to access the keys. The technical challenge will be making it possible for the iPads to alert people when they have visitors, instead of having the alerts come from Envoy\u2019s servers. The goal is to make the change unnoticeable to users, Gadea says, but it could take months to get there.There will undoubtedly be many trade-offs, Gadea said. Not only will Envoy sacrifice the ability to send visitor notifications directly, but customer service also could be become more challenging. Today, if one of Envoy\u2019s 2,000 customers asks for help correcting a mistake in a visitor name or resetting a password, an Envoy customer service rep can lend a hand. Under the new system Envoy\u2019s reps could have their hands tied.The new system could also make it harder to fix software errors because Envoy will no longer be able to push out automatic updates from its servers. And if a customer loses its passwords or keys, Envoy won\u2019t have the ability to restore the lost data. It will be inaccessible forever.Gadea said he is not anti-government and would sell Envoy\u2019s services to the FBI if the agency wished to become a customer. \"It\u2019s like with your friends,\" he said, \"you\u2019re always going to find one thing you don\u2019t like about them. But you\u2019re not going to hate a person because of one disagreement.\"And he said he understands the trade-offs.\"\"For a small startup trying to iterate quickly, it definitely slows things down,\" Gadea said. \"But in the long run, it\u2019s a competitive advantage and it reduces risk on our company.

Like characters, they\u2019re given names, and serve as catalysts for action. Unlike most characters, they don\u2019t typically exhibit a capacity for change. They are concrete reminders of the fixed, often haunting past.Stately standing at the center of Rebecca Makkai\u2019s latest novel The Hundred-Year House is Laurelfield, a secret-ridden mansion that once served as an arts colony. We're first introduced to its most recent inhabitants: Zee, whose esteemed Marxist Studies curriculum has recently been shaken up by the opportunity to teach a summer course on ghost stories; her husband, Doug, whose attempt to pen a tenure track-earning monograph on poet Edwin Parfitt has been put on hold for a Babysitter's Club-like writing gig; Gracie Devohr, Zee\u2019s mother who bears a striking and hilarious resemblance to Lucille Bluth; Gracie\u2019s husband Bruce and his son Case; and Miriam, an off-kilter collage artist from Texas.When we meet the bumbling crew they are, among other silly exploits, preparing for Y2K by stocking up on preserved food, and, for some reason, purchasing a Chevy. But \"the ball came down, and the world did not end,\" and the disjointed family is left to consider that the \"millennium bullshit\" has clouded their awareness that the year 2000 also marked the end of a century. While cerebral Zee considers the 1900s to be \"the worst century... in all human history,\" whimsical Miriam acknowledges the good that came of it (\"... all the art... And jazz, and movies!\").Miriam\u2019s optimism is apparent in the art she creates. She repurposes found materials into cohesive, if not objectively beautiful, arrangements. Her outlook is infectious to Doug, who willfully falls in love with her, and is in keeping with the philosophy of many of the houses\u2019 inhabitants: Transformation is beautiful, and necessary for survival.Zee grew up on stories of revival: Actaeon, Philomela and Daphne, who is mentioned in the book\u2019s epigraph, a quote from Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses. Her parents raised her on anecdotes of their own transformations (although, as we read on, we realize that some were fictionalized or under exaggerated). Her father, for example, said to have reinvented himself, \"from alcoholic slouch to art critic.\" But, as several characters throughout the course of the novel demonstrate, reinventing oneself seems an impossible task when the house, with its dark crevices containing irrefutable historical archives, looms over each scene.The true stories behind the house\u2019s mythical former residents are eventually revealed, as Makkai expertly lurches back in time to 1955, to its artist residency days in the '20s, and finally to its conception in 1900. Edwin Parfitt (the subject of Doug\u2019s biography) was a poet-in-residence at Laurelfield, and his pessimism while living there is congruous with that of its modern-day inhabitants. He leaves abruptly, claiming the place has made his poetry darker, and that he must start anew elsewhere. His fellow residents seem bogged down by the atmosphere as well \u2013- one remarks, \"There\u2019s no love, only history.\"His desire to escape the confines of such a massive, inescapably literal structure is foreshadowed (or followed, depending on which timeline you\u2019re adhering to) by Zee, who realizes \"she had never been a hardboiled egg but a raw one... When that shell cracked, what else could a raw egg do but run?\" before fleeing Laurelfield.Makkai\u2019s clever choice to chronicle the house\u2019s history in reverse exposes the flimsiness of perceived facts, and their simultaneous ability to stifle arguably truer stories. She weaves an intricate web of myths, and although she slowly reveals which are rooted in reality, she also shows us that such knowledge might be irrelevant.What other reviewers think:NPR: \"The Hundred-Year House may be crowded with the tropes and tricks of classic horror, but make no mistake: It's not a horror story. Rebecca Makkai's style, a patchwork of ambition and aw-shucks charm, lets in just enough sunlight to scatter those things that go bump in the night.\"The Boston Globe: \"Makkai\u2019s lyrical prose quietly lifts off the page while her carefully crafted plot charges forward. Narratively, it\u2019s a precarious balance that could easily tip at any moment into contrivance or melodrama, but neither occurs as this author strikes a perfect equilibrium of dark humor and tragedy.\"Los Angeles Times: \"The Hundred Year House is a big-hearted gothic novel, an intergenerational mystery, a story of heartbreak and a romance, all crammed into one grand Midwestern estate.\"Who wrote it?Rebecca Makkai is the author of The Borrower. This is her second novel.Who will read it?Fans of family sagas, funny stories, and gothic tales.Opening lines:\"For a ghost story, the tale of Violet Saville Devohr was vague and underwhelming. She had lived, she was unhappy, and she died by her own hand somewhere in that vast house. If the house hadn't been a mansion, if the death hadn't been a suicide, if Violet Devohr's dark, refined beauty hadn't smoldered down from that massive oil portrait, it wouldn't have been a ghost story at all.\"Notable passage:\"Doug had started to see the world as reticulated. The way the colored pieces of any view fit together: windowsill, wall, sky, driveway, tree, roof. Shoe, carpet, book. If you looked long enough, the three-dimensional world flattened to a plane where every block of color was a tile, so tightly clicked together that no mortar showed through the cracks.\"Rating, out of ten:8.

Terrorism. Governments. Mental illness. Cancer. Losing our job. Our parents dying. If you're anything like me, you'll swing from total paralysis about the sheer number of potential or imagined dangers mounting against you, and violently rejecting panic as a concept, charging almost self-destructively towards a future. There's plenty to be scared of as a young person \u2013 but how do you quantify those fears? Which specific ones keep you up at night?In the VICELAND UK Census, we asked readers \"What are you most scared of?\". The answer that came out on top was: never finding love. You're more scared of never meeting the love of your life than being homeless, losing your job or finding yourself in the middle of a terrorist attack. It's even stronger for people who are single, a significant 42 percent say it is their biggest fear. Are we more romantic than we thought \u2013 or just lonelier than we'd like to admit?This fear of not finding love is, on some level, driven by isolation. It speaks volumes about self worth. Are we lonely? Every study from the past few years would suggest that we are. Loneliness was, until recently, thought to be a shadow following old people, but despite social media, we're the ones suffering from chronic disconnection. Britain was voted the loneliness capital of Europe, and it's not our ageing population we have to thank. In 2010, the Mental Health Foundation found loneliness is a greater concern among young people. The 18-to-34-year-olds surveyed were more likely to feel lonely often, to worry about feeling alone and to feel depressed because of loneliness than the over-55s. According to a 2014 national survey, 48 percent of 18-to-24-year-olds said they often felt lonely compared to the overall average of 34 percent. Young Londoners were roughly twice as likely to be lonely than the national average.Perhaps this plays into our ultimate fear because we're a generation that has grown up living between two parents' houses. Our template for life-long love is fractured, so we understand the transitory nature of relationships more than ever. It's not surprising we're cautious about commitment, or at least enter into it with a somewhat defeatist attitude and limited expectations. Although we know that separation often means longer term happiness when relationships break down, there's no clear end goal for our love lives. Maybe that's exactly why we crave it so much.The nature of dating is changing. The cycle of relationships gets tired. In your 20s, every time a relationship dies, it takes a little more energy to ready yourself for the next one. Perhaps we've shot ourselves in the foot by having so many options, or the illusion of options, this feeling that there could be someone better or more a fulfilling relationship out there. Is the answer holding out for an idealised love while your fears of being single for too long are legitimised by the people around you settling down? In your 20s, when you can't get security from your job or housing situation, a real, loving relationship becomes a more idealised prospect. We don't like settling when it comes to anything, but our overall instability makes us crave it from somewhere.Another reason for our fear could be that we're finding it more difficult to maintain friendships. Being in love and in a relationship fills an undeniable void, even if you never thought you had it. Most people only feel fully \"known\" by the world when they're with another person; someone who sees the best and worst of you, witnesses you at every moment of any given day, takes you to hospital, knows with intimacy has to be the first person at your birthday or your gig or football match cheering you on. At my friend Jack Urwin's launch of his book, Man Up, he and a bloke from male suicide prevention charity CALM discussed that often the only person men will turn to in times of distress will be their partner. The reality is that many men lose mates throughout their 20s. Two and half million men over the age of 18 in Britain don't have a close friend they'd discuss a serious life problem with. Perhaps a big part of reshaping modern masculinity is the realisation that men crave intimacy just as much as women are stereotypically thought to.Despite all this, why should never finding love be our greatest worry? It's not something any of us would easily admit (I certainly wouldn't). Professor Ben Fincham, who has just finished writing a book on fun, told me the other day that after all his research, he's concluded that you have to be with another person or people to have fun. It just doesn't work if you're alone. To have fun \u2013 a temporal burst of life, joy, however you define it \u2013 allows you to feel pleasure, contentment, happiness, excited for a longer, less defined period of time after the fact.We're taught that interdependence is weak and individualism is to be celebrated \u2013 we don't want to be our mum or dad in our late 40s, divorced and lost, surrounded by the pieces of a half-baked identity. Yet when it comes down to hopes and fears, we're no different to our parents and their parents and anyone who came before us. We want to be our grandparents, linking arms for a walk to the shop and pissing each other off as way of conversation. We want something that will last.@hannahrosewensWe launched a TV channel!

Recently, however, I decided to use my iPhone 6 Plus instead, and it's worked better than I ever would have expected.With the volume turned up to its maximum setting, I'm able to distinctly hear music and podcasts in a medium sized room (roughly about 8 x 9 ft).

That may be true, but if you're resting your phone on your desk or dresser while your cleaning your room or on your coffee table while hanging out with friends, the sound is excellent.To be clear: yes, you'll still need to connect your phone to external speakers if you plan to host a party or need something particularly loud.

After ordering his meal online with careful instructions, including an allergy alert, dad and his 6-year-old daughter found themselves in for the fright of her life.When they arrived at the restaurant and picked up their sandwiches, dad took his girl to a table and they started eating. Since she is allergic to peanuts, her dad, John Russo, was careful to alert the cooks. Plus, he ordered a grilled cheese for her, so there should be no worries.But since Panera Bread employs immigrants in the kitchen who are unable to read or understand English, his girl started vomiting and was rushed to the ER. But dad\u2019s jaw dropped when he saw what was inside her sandwich.After his 6-year-old girl said her sandwich tasted \"weird,\" dad peeled the grilled cheese open. Inside, smack dab in the center, dad saw a large dollop of peanut butter. It was almost like the cooks at Panera Bread were trying to kill the severely allergic girl.John Russo, the father of the victim, called 911 and his daughter was airlifted to a nearby hospital after she started vomiting and went into anaphylactic shock.Russo claims that he used a computer to place his order with Panera Bread. This made it faster for him and his family. In the notes section, he carefully warned the staff that his daughter had a severe nut allergy. Plus, he ordered the grilled cheese, a nut-free food.But before the little girl was even able to enjoy her cheesy sandwich, she started vomiting and broke out in hives.Dad was appalled and shocked when he peeled apart the bread slices and found peanut butter slathered inside the grilled cheese sandwich.After being airlifted to the hospital, the little girl was given a life-saving shot of epinephrine. Then she was forced to stay the night under doctor\u2019s care because they wanted to make sure her allergic reaction had completely subsided.While this might be shock enough, the real problem is in Panera Bread\u2019s excuse for the accident.Since the upset father couldn\u2019t believe that despite his precaution, the restaurant still got his order wrong, he called up Panera Bread and demanded to speak to the manager.When he asked the manager why there was peanut butter on his daughter\u2019s grilled cheese sandwich, the manager said they had \"language issues\" in the kitchen.The manager blamed the potentially deadly mistake on the immigrant cook\u2019s inability to read English.

The nail-biters were identified as being organizational perfectionists, a personality type marked by a tendency to make detailed plans and overwork themselves, and they often become frustrated by a lack of activity. Nail-biting and other repetitive behaviors are just their way of releasing their pent-up energy.Impact Of The Study Nail-biting might seem relatively harmless, but it can cause some long-term damage. WebMD says that nail-biting can lead to infection, weak teeth, and deformed nails. These risks, along with how prevalent this behavior is, have made nail-biting one of the leading areas that psychotherapists work with their clients on. \"These findings suggest that individuals suffering from body-focused repetitive behaviors could benefit from treatments designed to reduce frustration and boredom and to modify perfectionist beliefs,\" said Sarah Roberts, who also helped author the study.

Benning / GFZYour first thought on seeing this weird pink snow might be an industrial accident or a nearby Big Foot massacre. Rest assured, it\u2019s neither\u2014just a perfectly natural, snow-dwelling algae. So, why are scientists all in a tizzy about it? Because it\u2019s causing glaciers to melt faster.That\u2019s the startling conclusion of a study just published in Nature Communications that which suggests we may have seriously underestimated the ability of tiny red algae to screw with Earth\u2019s ice caps. And their so-called \"bio-albedo\" feedback is only expected to grow as the planet warms up.Red snow algae have been described all over the world in polar and alpine settings from Greenland and Antarctica to Iceland and the European Alps. In the winter, they lie dormant in the snow as spores. But in the late spring and summer, when their icy habitat begins to melt, they blossom to produce striking pink landscapes.Now, a sweeping analysis of red snow algae across 21 glaciers in the pan-European Arctic shows that these tiny critters are actually helping the snow melt faster.An up-close shot of a colony of red snow algae. Image: Stefanie Lutz/GFZThe reason has to do with a simple climate-altering process known as the albedo effect. You\u2019ve probably heard about how glaciers keep our planet cool by reflecting sunlight. As glaciers melt, they give way to darker land or ocean surfaces\u2014surfaces with a lower albedo. This causes the Earth to absorb more sunlight and heat up even more.Turns out, red snow algae have a non-trivial effect on the albedo of the snowy surfaces they colonize, reducing it by as much as 13 percent, according to the new study. And while it\u2019s still unclear just how large these blooms can get, lead study author Steffi Lutz of the University of Leeds says they can be quite widespread in the Arctic by summertime.Sponsored\"Based on personal observations, a conservative estimate would be 50 percent of the snow surface on a glacier at the end of a melt season,\" she told Gizmodo in an email. \"But this can potentially be even higher.\"This makes red snow algae an unaccounted mechanism in the long list of reasons the Arctic is melting like a popsicle in a microwave. Lutz and her colleagues are now working to estimate how much glacial melt red snow algae are actually responsible for. They\u2019re also hoping to incorporate the colorful critters into future global climate models.What\u2019s worrisome is that even if red snow algae have a small influence on Arctic ice cover today, their role is likely to grow as human carbon emissions warm the planet.\"The algae need liquid water in order to bloom,\" Lutz said. \"Therefore the melting of snow and ice surfaces controls the abundance of the algae. The more melting, the more algae. With temperatures rising globally, the snow algae phenomenon will likely also increase leading to an even higher bio-albedo effect.\"It\u2019s yet another reminder that microbes are pulling the strings around here much more than we humans tend to appreciate.

Much like Lewis, Brooks wields a sharp dagger from a detached, chuckling remove\u2014as when he writes that Clarence Saunders, the founder of the Piggly Wiggly supermarket chain, had \"a gift, of which he may or may not have been aware, for comedy,\" or when ne notes that Saunders \"in his teens was employed by the local grocer at the pittance that is orthodox for future tycoons taking on their first jobs.\" Brooks\u2019 piece about Saunders also employs Lewis\u2019 go-to trope: an eccentric underdog pitted against a hidebound establishment. Clarence Saunders could be Billy Beane, or The Big Short\u2019s one-eyed investor Michael Burry.You know who else sounds like Brooks? Warren Buffett. Classic homespun Buffett-isms like \"you only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out\" and \"I try to buy stock in businesses that are so wonderful that an idiot can run them. Because sooner or later, one will\" would fit right in alongside Brooks\u2019 wry turns of phrase. It comes as no shock that Buffet loves this book, and it would likewise be no surprise if he\u2019d consciously modeled his writing on Brooks\u2019 example.(As for Bill Gates, the evidence of his impeccable taste in nonfiction is at this very moment glowing before your eyes. Slate was launched at Microsoft under Gates\u2019 watch, and Gates was reportedly \"a huge fan and supporter.\" Dude appreciates sharp journalism.)2) The reporting is nuanced. As Gates notes in his essay about Business Adventures, Brooks eschews \"listicles\" and doesn\u2019t \"boil his work down into pat how-to lessons or simplistic explanations for success.\" Instead, he tells entertaining stories replete with richly drawn characters, setting them during heightened moments within the world of commerce. Brooks invites the reader to draw her own conclusions about best practices. But after reading a bunch of these pieces, you can\u2019t help but see that businesses don\u2019t rise or plummet based on trendy strategies, or advanced research metrics, or silly employee perks. Their fortunes are determined by small groups of humans\u2014full of flaws and foibles\u2014who come together, make decisions under pressure, and either fail or succeed to create something larger than the sum of their parts.For example: Conventional wisdom at one time held that the flameout of the Edsel stemmed from Ford\u2019s overreliance on consumer poll testing, which led the company astray. But Brooks reveals that this is far too reductive a conclusion. It\u2019s what we might call a just-so story (or describe\u2014with a nod to a certain current-day business writer who tends toward the reductive\u2014as \"Gladwellian\"). In fact, there were all sorts of intertwined reasons that the Edsel didn\u2019t sell. The car\u2019s advertising hype grossly overpromised, while its mediocre design underdelivered. The secular trend in 1957 was toward smaller cars, while the Edsel was a throwback to, as Brooks describes it, \"fat, tail-finny 1955.\" The appearance that fall of the sleek Russian Sputnik satellite convinced Americans that our technology was clunky, inferior, and encrusted with useless gewgaws, and somehow the Edsel became the embodiment of this shame.But most of all, the Edsel failed because a group of men, sometimes working in concert and sometimes at odds, made a series of decisions that didn\u2019t pan out. As Mitt Romney once put it, in a slightly different context: Corporations are people, my friend. Brooks introduces us, for example, to a pipe-smoking, professorial Ford executive who consults a poetess for potential model names. Her suggestions (including \"Utopian Turtletop\" and \"Mongoose Civique\") are perhaps wisely rejected, but the eventual and uninspiring winner (\"Edsel,\" after a Ford family patriarch) is declared by fiat when a second executive decides he\u2019s had juuuuust about enough of these creative shenanigans. The pipe smoker subsequently flees to academia, where he obtains a Ph.D. in sociology.3) The lessons still apply. When Brooks writes about the Edsel, he could easily be reporting on a disastrous consumer product launch that happened last week, with the attendant finger-pointing at marketing mishaps and engineering snafus. When he recounts an inexplicable three-day panic that occurred on Wall Street in 1962, he might as well be talking about the mysterious \"Flash Crash\" of 2010. When he opines on the flaws of the federal income tax, he could be filing a dispatch from any moment in the last century. (He suggests that the tax is \"a serpent in the American Garden of Eden, offering such tempting opportunities for petty evasion that it induces a national fall from grace every April,\" and chronicles \"the seasonal appearance of special provisions to save people in the upper brackets from the inconvenience of having to pay those rates.\")Perhaps the eeriest and most edifying piece to read from a modern-day perspective is Brooks\u2019 look inside Xerox during a moment of transition. Here was a firm that experienced massive success at whiplash speeds, rising so far, so fast, that it wasn\u2019t quite sure where to go next. Consider: In the mid-1950s, Americans made about 20 million copies annually, using bad technology that produced worse results. By 1964, after Xerox introduced xerography\u2014a vastly superior, proprietary process that at last let copies be made on regular paper and with great velocity\u2014that figure climbed to 9.5 billion. Two years later, we were making 14 billion copies a year.Xerography was a technological revolution that some observers at the time put on par with the invention of the wheel. Brooks describes a burgeoning \"mania\" for copying\u2014\"a feeling that nothing can be of importance unless it is copied, or is a copy itself.\" Marshall McLuhan fretted that xerography would \"bring a reign of terror into the world of publishing,\" and warned, \"there is no possible protection from technology except by technology.\"In short, the arrival of xerography spurred hopes and fears not unlike those stirred up in the early days of the World Wide Web. It was a piece of tech that we might now call \"disruptive.\" It turned office culture on its head, changed the nature of text propagation more than anything since the days of Gutenberg, and coined a new dual noun/verb: I\u2019ll Xerox it; let me make a Xerox. As for Xerox the company, it was generating so much profit that it seemed as though its copier drums were spitting out U.S. currency. When Brooks pays a visit to the corporate campus in Rochester, New York, he finds the executives\u2019 biggest concerns revolve around Xerox\u2019s charitable support for the United Nations\u2014a cause the company championed but one that bore little relation to its core business.At the height of its success, Xerox neglected to foresee its own demise. Then as now, disruption begat adaptation. Copying grew commonplace. Xerox plowed its revenue into R&D in a search for the next hit, but never managed to translate its breakthroughs into best-selling products.Bill Gates calls the Xerox piece one of Brooks\u2019 \"most instructive stories.\" It\u2019s easy to see why the former Microsoft CEO might consider this the most poignant of tales among the many poignant tales that populate Business Adventures. In Xerox, we see a corporate behemoth with a single, killer product; a desperate but mostly ineffective effort to find something else that gets traction in the marketplace; and an embarrassment of riches that are nobly redirected toward global betterment.", "answers": {"answer_start": [222], "text": ["Business Adventures"]}, "id": "490190944101478401"}, {"question": "Here's THE reason you should watch the Oscars", "context": "Oscar Sunday is upon us, and as movie lovers gear up for the epic award show, there's clearly one celebrity in particular everyone can't wait to see: Jennifer Lawrence.Not only is the 23-year-old an extraordinary actress, she's also completely entertaining in her unusual yet endearing, quirky way.

The bridge crosses over a major river which provides access to ports for large ships which means that the bridge had to be built extremely high up so that the ships could pass through underneath with no problems at all.In order to reach a suitable height for the ships, a steep incline is needed to get the cars high up enough before crossing the river which causes the bridge to acquire a terrifying image:This type of structure is absolutely terrifying, and I know that I would not feel happy having to drive up this type of incline!The bridge is beautifully designed, and though the slope looks extremely steep in these pictures, the engineers were able to design it with a max slope of 6.1 percent, which is pretty good.

His handprint remains on display at the New York branch of the museum.So you may recall that people like to make fun of Donald Trump for having small hands.The insults go back to the 1980s, when Spy magazine dubbed Trump a \"short-fingered vulgarian\" \u2014 an epithet that apparently rankled Trump so much, he continued to send photos of his hands to editors decades later.Graydon Carter wrote about it in April\u2019s Vanity Fair.New life was breathed into scrutiny of Trump\u2019s hands during the Republican primary. In February, Senator Marco Rubio joked, \"You know what they say about men with small hands,\" after saying Trump had the hands of someone 5 feet, 2 inches tall.Trump, of course, couldn\u2019t let that stand. In a March GOP debate, Trump assured the audience his hands were just fine \u2014 and so was everything else. (You know, his penis.)But how big are Trump\u2019s hands really? The answer was unclear until The Hollywood Reporter found answers in an unlikely place \u2014 Madame Tussauds, the wax museum.In 1997, a team from Madame Tussauds took molds and measurements of Trump\u2019s body parts \u2014 including his hands \u2014 to create a life-size wax sculpture, THR reported.The wax Trump is no longer on display, but a bronze mold of Republican nominee\u2019s hand remains on the wall of the museum\u2019s New York branch.Per THR, Trump\u2019s hand measures 7.25 inches from the tip of his middle finger to his wrist. And that\u2019s undeniably on the small size.Online references generally agree that the average man\u2019s hand is 7.44 inches long. Trump, of course, is taller than the average man, measuring around 6 feet, 2 inches.So, Trump has smaller hands than most men, and particularly small hands for his size. Don\u2019t believe it?

The local news media insists that he is helping with an important investigation in China. The police say he left the territory through a normal border control point.But Xiao Jianhua, one of China\u2019s wealthiest and most politically connected financiers, whose disappearance last month sent a chill through Hong Kong and the political class in Beijing, does not appear to be fine.In the early hours of Jan. 27, he was taken out of the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong in a wheelchair, his head covered by a sheet or a blanket, according to people who have seen or been briefed on video footage captured by security cameras in the hotel.Mr. Xiao, 45, who was not known to use a wheelchair, was accompanied by about half a dozen unidentified men who were also pushing a large suitcase on rollers. He is believed to have been transported by boat from Hong Kong, eluding border controls, and is now in police custody in mainland China, according to two people familiar with the investigation into his whereabouts.While the reasons for his apparent abduction remain a mystery, it comes ahead of an important Communist Party leadership meeting this year that will fill top posts, leading to speculation that someone powerful may have wanted Mr. Xiao out of the way, or perhaps wanted to use him to silence rivals with whom he has business ties.Few people are in a position to know more about the financial holdings of China\u2019s leading political families than Mr. Xiao, who made billions investing in banks, insurers and real estate around the world. In the past decade, he has served as a de facto banker to the Communist Party elite.His disappearance has again raised fears about Chinese encroachment into Hong Kong in violation of the \"one country, two systems\" rule that allows this former British colony to run its own affairs and bars mainland security forces from operating here. A year ago, the city was outraged when five Hong Kong booksellers disappeared \u2014 only to turn up in Chinese custody.Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, said Mr. Xiao\u2019s extraction from Hong Kong was unlikely to have occurred without the approval of China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, who has challenged party traditions of collective leadership with a bold drive to consolidate power.Mr. Tsang said Mr. Xi might be holding Mr. Xiao in custody to protect himself or to gain leverage against people he \"needs to persuade\" at the coming party congress to push through his agenda and cement his legacy.\"I do not know if the operation was initiated or ordered by Xi, but his consent must have been given, in light of Xiao\u2019s connections with Xi\u2019s family,\" Mr. Tsang said in an email.In January 2013, weeks after Mr. Xi came into power at the last party congress, his sister and brother-in-law sold their stake in an investment firm to a company founded by Mr. Xiao. Mr. Xiao later said the move was part of an effort by the Xi family to exit investments, which reduced Mr. Xi\u2019s political vulnerability as he embarked on a sweeping campaign against corruption.But Mr. Xiao also appears to have done business with relatives of other party leaders, including Zeng Qinghong, a former vice president and power broker whom Mr. Xi may consider a potential threat.A Chinese-born Canadian citizen with an Antiguan diplomatic passport, Mr. Xiao has lived in a serviced apartment at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong for years, attended to by a coterie of female bodyguards.On the night he disappeared, the men in plain clothes were recorded by closed-circuit security cameras entering his suite with a wheelchair and the large suitcase, according to one of the people familiar with the footage.Some time later, the men emerged from the suite with Mr. Xiao in the wheelchair, along with several women and the suitcase. Mr. Xiao was not struggling but seemed fatigued and his head was covered, according to the people familiar with the video. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the news media or feared retaliation by the Chinese government.The lobby of the Four Seasons apartment tower is separate from the main hotel, with its own front desk and a single door that opens with a key card. Hotel staff members there questioned the men who left with Mr. Xiao, and they were told that the men were part of his security detail and that he was ill and needed medical attention, the people said.Mr. Xiao\u2019s disappearance has been marked by confusion and misinformation.His flagship company, The Tomorrow Group, printed a front-page advertisement in Mr. Xiao\u2019s name on Feb. 1 in Ming Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper, saying that he had not been abducted and that he was \"recuperating abroad.\" But that was a lie meant to appease the Chinese government, which did not want his case discussed in the news media, one person close to Mr. Xiao\u2019s family said at the time.Days after the apparent abduction, the Hong Kong police disclosed that one of Mr. Xiao\u2019s relatives had filed a missing persons report but later withdrew it. The police also said that Mr. Xiao had left at \"one of Hong Kong\u2019s boundary control points.\"Asked about the possibility that Mr. Xiao had left Hong Kong by boat, the police said in a statement that they were continuing to investigate. Amy Powell, a spokeswoman for the Four Seasons, said the hotel would not comment.Mr. Xiao\u2019s family members have been allowed to communicate with him, a person close to the family said, adding that his wife is concerned about his heath because he left Hong Kong without his medication for angina and other ailments.Mr. Xiao\u2019s path to fortune began shortly after he graduated from Peking University, where he enrolled as a child prodigy at age 14. He was head of the official student union and remained loyal to the government even as many of his classmates participated in the pro-democracy protests that ended in a bloody crackdown in June 1989.As his wealth rose, he entered into various business deals with relatives of the Communist Party elite.Several companies affiliated with Mr. Xiao were involved in the controversial 2006-7 privatization of Luneng, a huge state-run power company in Shandong Province, in eastern China. Among the others who gained shares was a man named Zeng Ming, according to an expose\u0301 published by the investigative magazine Caijing that the Chinese authorities later ordered removed from newsstands.Overseas Chinese news media later identified Zeng Ming as a pseudonym used by the son of Zeng Qinghong, the former vice president.In January 2009, one of the Tomorrow Group\u2019s main companies, Baotou Tomorrow Technology, announced that it would pay about $50 million to buy property in southwestern China from a company headed by the son-in-law of the fourth-ranking member of the Communist Party at the time, Jia Qinglin, company records show.While both Mr. Jia and Mr. Zeng are retired, they have long been seen as important allies of Jiang Zemin, the former president and party leader who continues to wield some influence.Another prominent Chinese businessman who has taken refuge in Hong Kong to stay out of reach of mainland authorities and spoke on the condition of anonymity said that Mr. Xiao\u2019s extraordinary political connections made him an obvious target.Mr. Xiao, he said, was in a special category.", "answers": {"answer_start": [283], "text": ["Xiao Jianhua"]}, "id": "830452858382385152"}, {"question": "This is Officially The 'Oldest Animal On Earth'", "context": "Scientists have revealed the gigantic Greenland shark is officially the world\u2019s oldest animal in the world.The shark, which lives in the icy Arctic waters, has an average lifespan of 272 years old and could live up to a staggering 400 years old.Research published in the journal of Science this week revealed that the Greenland shark, or Somniosus microcephalus\u2019s lifespan is more than 60 years longer than that of the the bowhead whale, the previous contender for longest-living vertebrate.This sturdy shark survives in -1C to 10C waters and can swim as deep as 7,200ft. Not to mention, they can weight up to a tonne. So, it is safe to say that they do their fair share of growing during their 400 years on the planet.In the past scientists have been baffled by how old these sharks can live however, the study\u2019s lead author, Julius Nielsen, revealed that now it is officially considered the oldest animal in the world.When 28 female sharks were accidentally caught in a commercial fishing trip Nielsen and his team jumped at the chance to research these mysterious creatures.Unlike the conventional methods used to determine the age of ordinary fish, these do not apply to Greenlands, which makes it harder to know with certainty just how old they are.However, this exclusive opportunity to get up close and personal with them allowed the team to work out a test whereby they would have a better idea of their lifespan.Hence, why the Greenland shark has only just been crowned the oldest animal on the planet.Up until now the bowhead whale was the king of the world.

She wanted to get all of the problems worked out and a detailed analysis made before proceeding with Phase 2 -- a process she estimated would take until next summer.She also wanted to buy laptops -- not iPads -- for some high schools to determine whether those devices would better fit the instructional needs of those students.But Deasy persuaded her and the other board members to allow him to push ahead with Phase 2, which involves the purchase of iPads for 35 schools, plus every teacher and administrator -- a total of about 70,000 devices.Each elementary school will also get a mobile cart holding a number of iPads, so students can participate in field tests scheduled in March of the online assessments aligned to the new math and English standards taking effect next fall.The district will also buy iPad keyboards for the middle and high schools participating in Phase 1. That purchase had been delayed when the first contract was awarded because officials were convinced they could get a better deal if they waited.At the insistence of board member Steve Zimmer, officials also vowed to take a hard look at the contract before moving forward with the purchase of the iPads for Phase 2. He was convinced, he said, that LAUSD hadn't gotten the best deal when it agreed to pay $678 for each tablet, which comes pre-loaded with instructional software being developed by Pearson Education Inc.Tuesday marked the first time that Deasy has actively participated in the discussion about iPads. He previously had been excluded because he owned about a dozen shares of Apple stock, but he since sold those.With little discussion, the board approved that $30 million contract in June to buy iPads for kids and teachers at 47 schools. But the creation of a technology committee chaired by Ratliff -- and stubborn questions about security, cost, instructional materials and parental responsibility -- prompted a more thorough review as the board prepares to award contracts for the next phase of the project.About 30,000 teachers and students at 47 schools received iPads this year, the first phase of the gradual rollout.

Your favorite writers. Wherever you want them. Personalize SI with our new App. Install on iOS or Android.\u200bLast fall, the Warriors hired a famous person for an obscure position, tabbing two-time MVP Steve Nash as a player development consultant. The job description was as amorphous as the title suggests. Nash worked out a bit with Klay Thompson. He sent texts to Steph Curry. A few days every month he flew from his home in Los Angeles to Oakland. Occasionally he addressed the team, walking through actions and demonstrating ball screens. But Nash, who retired only a year ago, was not looking for a full-time gig. He is a father of three, the general manager of the Canadian national team and a promising movie producer.In 2014, when Nash was still a Laker, he agreed to film conversations with other luminaries for a Vice Sports series called \"Back & Forth.\" In the most notable video, Nash sits on a black leather sofa, wearing a T-shirt and shorts. Next to him, appearing equally casual, is another former MVP: Kevin Durant. With Nash steering the dialogue, they reflect in hushed tones on their roots, motivations and methods. Durant tells Nash that he used to create imaginary basketball games as a boy, using Hot Wheels as players, pennies as balls and tables as courts. They laugh. They connect.The story of Durant\u2019s departure from Oklahoma City and arrival in Golden State, a move that rocked a league and spawned a superpower, features two iconic point guards. The Warriors believe that Durant, loyal to Russell Westbrook on a personal level, was weary of his ball-dominant approach. Curry presented a free-flowing alternative. But several Golden State coaches and executives also acknowledge the everlasting assist of yet another legendary floor general. \"Without Steve Nash,\" one says, \"I\u2019m not sure if we get Kevin Durant.\"Representatives from six teams passed through the gates of the Hamptons mansion where Durant spent the July 4th weekend. The Warriors presentation wasn\u2019t necessarily more memorable than the others. \"We heard the Clippers \u2018blew him away,\u2019\" says Golden State general manager Bob Myers. \"We didn\u2019t blow him away.\" Durant was most struck by the body language of the four players in the room\u2014Curry, Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala\u2014their effortless conversation and easy laughter. He remarked that they looked as if they were holding hands, even though they were not actually touching. Durant had heard all the breathless accounts of the Dubs\u2019 renowned esprit de corps. He wondered whether their kinship was real, and if it was, whether there was space for another in that cocoon. Those were the questions that nagged at him after the gang left.\u2022 Kevin Durant to the Warriors might be NBA's most fascinating move everThe Warriors did not lure Durant at the meeting, but in the 48 hours that followed. They are a collaborative organization\u2014remember Nick U\u2019Ren, the lower-level staffer who suggested the lineup change that helped capture the 2015 championship; and Chris DeMarco, the player development coach who recommended switching sides of the court in Game 6 of this year\u2019s Western Conference finals\u2014so it should come as no surprise that free agency was also a group effort with contributions from unlikely sources. Warriors\u2019 advisor Jerry West made headlines with a phone call, but Durant shared more fundamental concerns about chemistry and fit in conversations with Nash.\"Steve knows us\u2014our culture and our guys\u2014so well,\" says Golden State assistant coach Bruce Fraser, who was with Nash in Phoenix, as were several other Warriors staffers. \"He doesn\u2019t sell anybody on anything. He\u2019s just a great sounding board.\" Fraser was also crucial, because he is close to Nash and spoke with him throughout the process. The Warriors were therefore able to understand Durant\u2019s concerns and address them. Even though Myers did not call or text Durant directly, he deployed others, including head coach Steve Kerr. \"It\u2019s orchestrating from a distance,\" Myers says. \"\u2018Steve, ask if he has any questions. Steph, give him a call so he\u2019s more comfortable. Andre, he might want to hear from you.\u2019 I encouraged all of them. I\u2019m sure other teams did the same thing. But we wanted to feel like, if he said no, it wasn\u2019t because we didn\u2019t show him who we were.\"\u2022\u200b Open Floor Podcast: Debating Kevin Durant's decision to join the WarriorsYour browser does not support iframes.Executives who saw Durant over the weekend, in the mansion off the beach, say he looked drained. He was sitting through as many as six hours of meetings per day, while simultaneously hearing from the Warriors, whose pitch never really ended. Iguodala told Durant he\u2019d have the time of his life in Golden State. Curry insisted he\u2019d be embraced immediately. The Warriors\u2019 incumbent star swore he didn\u2019t care about billboards or shoe sales. He just wanted banners. Durant, already seduced by the Dubs\u2019 rollicking offensive system, was sold. When nine Thunder officials visited Durant on Sunday afternoon, hoping for the last word, they realized they were too late. Durant woke up July 4 at 7 a.m. with his decision made. Informing Oklahoma City general manager Sam Presti, Durant said, was the hardest thing he\u2019s ever done. Calling Myers was even a struggle. \"I just want to say you guys are a great first-class organization,\" he told the Warriors GM. \"It was great getting to know you....but.\"Myers was expecting the qualifier. He had prepared a concession speech, thanking Durant for his consideration, wishing him well in Oklahoma City. \"But I just want to tell you I\u2019m coming to the Warriors,\" Durant continued. He wasn\u2019t purposefully messing with Myers. He was rattled and fried. When word of his announcement reached Kerr, on vacation in Hawaii, the sun wasn\u2019t up yet over the islands. \"We got him! We got him!\" hollered Kerr\u2019s wife, Margot, turning over in bed and waking him with jabs to the leg.There was euphoria in Golden State and agony in Oklahoma City, same as six weeks before, in the wake of the West finals. But the pain was more acute this time and will take longer to subside. Before every game last season, Thunder head coach Billy Donovan slipped into Durant\u2019s locker a hand-written note. Sometimes it was about leadership. Sometimes it was about defense. Sometimes it was just about the upcoming matchup. It was a simple gesture, one of many, underlining OKC\u2019s dedication to Durant. Yes, Westbrook pounds the ball more than Curry, but Westbrook is still one of the three best point guards alive. Yes, Golden State\u2019s attack is more fluid than Oklahoma City\u2019s, but the Thunder still put up the second highest offensive rating of any team in the past five years. If they cannot retain a marquee free agent, after coming up five minutes short of the Finals, what small market can?\u2022 Heartbreak in Oklahoma City: KD says goodbye to city he helped shapeThe NBA will have to answer that question, same as in 2010, when the Heat assembled their Big Three and prompted a lockout the following year. The Thunder, meanwhile, must gauge whether they can realistically re-sign Westbrook next summer or if they have to trade him. They can\u2019t lose another superstar for squat. And the Warriors, the lone winners in all this, get to slide the league\u2019s most dynamic scorer next to the two most feared shooters. In the Hamptons, Kerr called up about 15 Warriors plays on his laptop and projected them onto a big-screen TV, showing Durant how he could contribute. \"I\u2019ve got some bad habits,\" KD said. \"That\u2019s okay,\" Kerr replied. \"I\u2019ll yell at you.\"Westbrook wasn\u2019t the only iso-heavy star in Oklahoma City; Durant also liked to hold the ball. But the Warriors are enamored with the potential of his playmaking ability. They envision running offense through him at the elbow and in the post, where he can kick to shooters and cutters if the defense collapses, or rise and fire if it doesn\u2019t. With Curry and Thompson spreading the court, Durant will enjoy massive swaths of space, and he may never see a double team again. \"It should be seamless,\" Kerr said. The Warriors don\u2019t have a rim-protecting center, or many qualified reserves, having discarded a chunk of their rotation to make room for Durant. But those are Dom Perignon problems. The Big Four, plus a stiff in marketing, could probably win 50.The first day, though, was not easy. At his introductory press conference, Durant sat stiffly atop the dais, bracing for the inevitable queries about shortcuts to titles. When Kerr suggested he might bring his shiny new acquisition off the bench, everybody laughed except Durant, causing the coach to clarify. \"I\u2019m joking,\" he said. Eventually, Durant warmed up. \"We live in this superhero comic book world,\" he said, \"where you\u2019re either a villain or you\u2019re a superhero...I trusted my gut. I trusted my instincts. It\u2019s the unpopular decision. But I can live with it.\" From the Philippines, where Canada participated in an Olympic qualifying tournament, Nash downplayed his friend\u2019s quest for NBA gold. \"I think it was as much a personal move for his happiness and development as it was to win,\" Nash told reporters.Late Thursday, after a week of advice, introspection and upheaval, Durant went looking for a little of the joy the Warriors talk so much about. There was only one place to go. He wrapped up his press conference and walked onto the practice court.

I was ready to set out on my task: Commenting the same comment over and over and over on popular Instagram accounts, many of whom were owned by people I've never heard of (Nina Dobrev? Shay Mitchell? Bethany Noel Mota?) (Canadian actresses and a vlogger, respectfully\u2014now I know), and more than one of which served to showcase photographs of nail art.I asked Kim Kardashian and Ariana Grande for birthday shout-outs, hoping that Kim Kardashian's motherly instincts and Ariana Grande's ponytail and childlike sense of wonder would propel them to tell me what's up happy bday:I asked JUSTTTEEEEEN Bieber and Taylor Swift, who was SO GOOD ON SNL:I asked Nicki Minaj, a #queen, and Vanessa Hudgens, a young woman whom I believe I could pick out of a lineup but am not sure if I can be honest:And so on. It was my birthday, and I was having fun.The BlockThat is, until I received this \"no\" from an incredibly rude Dan Bilzerian fan.Soon after I was blocked from commenting on Instagram.On. My. Birthday.Incredible.This was disrespectful and unreasonable and I have very little doubt but no proof at all that it was the work of that incredibly rude Dan Bilzerian fan, (I imagine he must have reported me, that piece of shit), (who would have thought, a piece of shit Dan Bilzerian fan), (of course that was sarcastic).Dan Bilzerian, if you are unaware, is an Instagram celebrity known for kicking a woman in the face and throwing another woman off of a roof. \"All right, but what is he known for, like, for real?\" you're wondering. I don't know. Instagram? Poker, and then also having a lot of guns, but mostly the thing of where he kicked a woman in the face and threw another off of a roof.Now, did a Dan Bilzerian fan report me, or was I simply banned for posting 54 of the same comment in the span of roughly ten minutes? We'll never know. What I did know was: I had 46 Instagram shout-outs left to request. Instagram provided me with a form to fill out if I felt my blocking was unreasonable, which, of course, I did:The form did nothing. I waited a day and the blocking still held. The Internet told me that it could last anywhere from 24 hours to one month, which seemed, no offense, like a wild guess. I had to think of an alternate plan.A Backup PlanBy this time it was February 17th: Michael Jordan's birthday, as you may know.Thiswas my way back. I set up the account mjbday69 and set out to comment \"Can I get a shoutout for Michael Jordan's bday?\" on the remaining 46 popular Instagram accounts. In order to fool any celebrities who might want to verify the fact that I truly desired a shout-out for Michael Jordan's birthday, I populated the account with seven photos, alternating between photos of Michael Jordan and photos of \"Happy Birthday.\"I asked Lady Gaga, who had just gotten engaged, congratulations, and Jessica Alba, who had just had an Epic #dinner, for a shout-out for Michael Jordan's birthday, for example:I asked Ellie Goulding, a blonde woman, and Adriana Lima, a brunette:In what was perhaps the most exciting moment of the entire experiment, I asked the NBA's Instagram account for a shout-out for Michael Jordan's birthday while they were having their own celebration for Michael Jordan's birthday:Happy birthday, Michael Jordan.Though I was terrified throughout this leg of the experiment that my account would again be blocked (if I were forced to make a third Instagram account it would have gone to Billie Joe Armstrong\u2014happy birthday, Billie Joe), I made it through to the other side unscathed, with all one hundred popular Instagram accounts solicited. Eat my dirt, Dan Bilzerian fan.What I Learned From My JourneyWhen all was said (commented) and done, I have to say\u2014I got it. The thrill of leaving your mark on a celebrity's life, however small, and the anticipation of awaiting their response added up to an experience that\u2014JK again, I don't know why people do this!The ResultsWhat follows is a complete record of my birthday shout-out winnings and failures:Instagram User Shout-Out Received Shout-Out Denied Instagram \u2713 Kim Kardashian \u2713 Beyonce \u2713 Ariana Grande \u2713 Selena Gomez \u2713 Justin Bieber \u2713 Taylor Swift \u2713 Kendall Jenner \u2713 Kylie Jenner \u2713 Khloe Kardashian \u2713 Miley Cyrus \u2713 Nicki Minaj \u2713 Neymar Jr. \u2713 Rihanna \u2713 Katy Perry \u2713 Kourtney Kardashian \u2713 Cristiano Ronaldo \u2713 National Geographic \u2713 Nike \u2713 Kevin Hart \u2713 Demi Lovato \u2713 Jennifer Lopez \u2713 9GAG \u2713 Victoria's Secret \u2713 Harry Styles \u2713 Leo Messi \u2713 Cara Delevingne \u2713 The Ellen Show \u2713 LeBron James \u2713 Niall Horan \u2713 One Direction \u2713 Chris Brown \u2713 Justin Timberlake \u2713 Drake \u2713 Nash Grier \u2713 The Rock \u2713 Scott Disick \u2713 James Rodrguez \u2713 FC Barcelona \u2713 Real Madrid C.F. \u2713 Dan Bilzerian \u2713 Vanessa Hudgens \u2713 Bruna Marquezine \u2713 Iggy Azalea \u2713 Shakira \u2713 David Luiz \u2713 Forever 21 \u2713 Nails Art Vidss \u2713 Cameron Dallas \u2713 Lucy Hale \u2713 Ashley Benson \u2713 Austin Mahone \u2713 Miranda Kerr \u2713 Lady Gaga \u2713 Kris Jenner \u2713 Jen Selter \u2713 Snooki \u2713 H&M \u2713 Shay Mitchell \u2713 Wiz Khalifa \u2713 Zendaya \u2713 Candice Swanepoel \u2713 NBA \u2713 Gareth Bale \u2713 Ciara \u2713 Nails Videos \u2713 Channing Tatum \u2713 Floyd Mayweather \u2713 Nature \u2713 Tyga \u2713 Best Vines \u2713 Jessica Alba \u2713 Pharrell \u2713 Amber Rose \u2713 Bethany Noel Mota \u2713 Ellie Goulding \u2713 Ian Somerhalder \u2713 Ansel Elgort \u2713 Liam Payne \u2713 Adriana Lima \u2713 Nina Dobrev \u2713 Adidas Originals \u2713 GoPro \u2713 Snoop Dogg \u2713 Sarcasm Only \u2713 Rita Ora \u2713 Zac Efron \u2713 Britney Spears \u2713 Kevin Durant \u2713 Euanitta \u2713 Nike Football (Soccer) \u2713 Louis Vuitton \u2713 Gisele Bundchen \u2713 Dani Alves \u2713 Sean Diddy Combs \u2713 Marcelo Vieira Jr. \u2713 Tata Werneck \u2713 50 Cent \u2713 Paris Hilton \u2713 Louis Tomlinson \u2713Not one shout-out.Thank you.[Illustration by Tara Jacoby]", "answers": {"answer_start": [7490], "text": ["Not one shout-out."]}, "id": "568596553675481088"}, {"question": "These guys deserve a standing ovation", "context": "For their work in helping empower the visually-impaired in the IT industry, dedicated brothers Arjun and Abhishek Mishra have been recognised individually \u2014 on either side of the Atlantic.Arjun, 27, finished as one of the runners-up in the UK-based Queen's Young Leaders 2017 program, while Abhishek, 31, has been elected South Asia representative of the Global Good Fund, a Washington, DC-based foundation.The Queen's Young Leaders program \"discovers, celebrates and supports\" extraordinary young talent from across the Commonwealth, in the field of social entrepreneurship.

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)This post has been updated.The FBI's decision to reopen an investigation of emails from Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state did not stop the Democratic presidential nominee from collecting yet another endorsement from a conservative newspaper editorial board. The State of Columbia, S.C., announced its endorsement of Clinton on Saturday night, the paper's first for a Democrat in 40 years.\"The Republican nominee for president could have been an intriguing option,\" the State's editorial board wrote. \"Donald Trump\u2019s resume describes a successful businessman with no ties to the political 'establishment.' \"But like so many other editorial boards, the State's determined that Trump's volatile temperament is impossible to ignore.\"Whatever intrigue his business resume generates is overshadowed by his character and personality,\" the paper concluded. \"He is simply unfit for the presidency, or any public office. That means we must rely on Hillary Clinton for any meaningful change in Washington politics.\"The State joins a growing list of newspapers with right-leaning editorial boards that are breaking with tradition and rejecting Trump. Earlier this month, the San Diego Union-Tribune bestowed on Clinton its first endorsement of a Democrat since 1868. The Arizona Republic, formerly the Arizona Republican, had never (as the name would suggest) endorsed a Democrat for president in its 126-year history. Then Donald Trump came along. The newspaper's conservative editorial board last month threw its support behind Clinton, calling her \"the only choice to move America ahead.\"\"The 2016 Republican candidate is not conservative, and he is not qualified,\" the Phoenix paper wrote. \"That's why, for the first time in our history, the Arizona Republic will support a Democrat for president.\"The Cincinnati Enquirer, noting it \"has supported Republicans for president for almost a century,\" also endorsed Clinton also in September. The Dallas Morning News backed Clinton earlier in the month, even though it \"has not recommended a Democrat for the nation's highest office since before World War II.\" And the Houston Chronicle endorsed Clinton in July, marking just the second time in 13 elections that it has supported a Democrat.Trump picked up his first general-election endorsement from a major newspaper last week \u2014 the Las Vegas Review-Journal, purchased in December by Republican mega donor and Trump supporter Sheldon Adelson. Several other right-leaning papers, including the Chicago Tribune, the Detroit News, the Union Leader of Manchester, N.H., the Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal and the Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch have backed Libertarian Gary Johnson.Trump often revels in negative media coverage, suggesting it validates his outsider status and proves that he is the change-maker the \"establishment\" fears. Indeed, many Trump voters seem drawn to the real estate magnate because of the bad press he receives, not in spite of it.Still, while repudiation by the New York Times editorial board is a badge of honor for a Republican nominee, virtually any GOP standard-bearer ought to be able to win over the State or the Arizona Republic or the Union-Tribune.But these papers just can't go there with Trump.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1232], "text": ["rejecting Trump"]}, "id": "54zrba"}, {"question": "The funny reason why Jets' Calvin Pryor had to turn down bachelor TV show", "context": "New York Jets safety Calvin Pryor sports a unique Star Wars-esque t-shirt, in the locker room following practice.

While it's still unknown just how big the deal will be (most estimates seem to place it in the $22-25 million per year range), what's clear is that the deal is coming (and likely this offseason).Recently, Luck appeared on \"The Ringer\" podcast with Kevin Clark and talked about all sorts of things (like books, Game of Thrones, and even a little bit of football), but one question that he was asked was what the nerdiest thing he will buy upon receiving that contract is. His response: a robot ping-pong returner.\"That's a good question,\" Luck said, laughing. \"Maybe, like, a robot ping-pong thing that can hit balls back at you. My buddy has one and he swears by it.\"Clark then followed it up by asking if Luck really has trouble finding some people to play ping-pong with. \"No, there's some good ping-pong players,\" Luck said, \"but sometimes, no one wants to hang out, you know?\"So there you have it. When Andrew Luck gets his new contract that is expected to be the largest deal in NFL history, he wants to buy a robot ping-pong returner.The interview was a good listen to learn more about Luck, as most of it wasn't even about football.

It's been great. We've got the rookies in the building, which is always fun. It seems like the roster doubles in size [with] a bunch of new guys and you don't know their names. It makes you remember being a rookie and walking in for the first time and seeing guys like Dwight Freeney and Reggie Wayne and Rob Mathis, Adam Vinatieri. I think every rookie thinks Vinatieri's a coach when they walk in the locker room and they're wondering why a coach gets a locker next to Robert Turbin. But no, it's a fun time and [I] feel great.\"Luck also talked about what he learned from last season and how he's working this offseason to address that.\"There's definitely some parts that I feel like I regressed in and maybe didn't improve,\" Luck said, \"and then there's obviously some parts that I feel like I actually did better in.

The advocacy group, which compiles shooting data using news reports, found that 278 such shootings occurred in 2015.An Everytown analysis of publicly reported gun deaths from December 2012 to December 2013 found that \"at least 100 children were killed in unintentional shootings \u2014 almost two each week\" during that time \u2014 the same period during which Brandon Holt was fatally shot in New Jersey.\"These aren\u2019t accidents,\" Everytown says. \"They\u2019re preventable. More than two-thirds of these tragedies could be avoided if gun owners stored their guns responsibly and prevented children from accessing them.\"The boys were playing a \"pretend shooting\" game at the Senatore home when the family\u2019s preschooler fired one shot that struck Brandon Holt in the head from about 15 yards away, according to NJ.com. He was rushed to a hospital, where he died the next day, according to the Asbury Park Press.During this week\u2019s court appearance, Anthony Senatore testified that he was only 10 feet away when his son fired the fatal shot.\"When the gun went off, I turned around and realized what gun it had been,\" Senatore said, according to video published by the Press. \"I immediately removed it from his hands and threw it into my garage up on my work bench. With that, I was going back to discipline him when my daughter had came running around the side of the building and said, \u2018Dad, dad, Brandon was shot.'\"[\u2018My 4-year-old gets jacked up to target shoot,\u2019 mom brags hours before he shoots her]Senatore\u2019s attorney, Robert Ebberup, told the paper last year that his client \u2014 a sportsman who hunts and fishes \u2014 had originally removed the rifle from a gun locker after hearing a noise in the middle of the night. Senatore testified that the weapon was wrapped in a towel and loaded at the time, according to the Press.The gun was under the bed for months.\"He left that gun under his bed for what he thought would be a couple of days, just in case that noise was an intruder trying to come into his house,\" Ebberup said. \"However, he forgot that it was there \u2014 and we know the rest.\"Senatore previously told the Press that he is \"not a monster,\" but acknowledged that he\u2019ll be haunted by what happened for as long as he lives.\"Each and every one of us have hobbies and other recreational activities that we pursue,\" he said. \"I am no different than any other person in that respect, but for one horrible mistake, one terrible lapse in judgment, which will define the remainder of my days.\"And yet, the rifle wasn\u2019t the only weapon that was left unsecured in the Senatore home, according to NJ.com.During a court appearance in 2014, Atlantic County Prosecutor Jim McClain said Senatore also kept multiple shotguns in the house, including a Remington 12-gauge and two Harrington & Richardsons. The weapons were placed near ammunition, the prosecutor said, in a household with three children aged 12, 8 and 4.[\u2018A child who commits first-degree murder cannot be willy-nilly turned loose into society\u2019]Senatore was sentenced in February 2015 to serve three years in prison, according to NJ.com. He was released on parole after serving nine months.Before he was sentenced, Senatore told a judge he accepted his role in Brandon Holt\u2019s death, according to the Press.\"The events of April 8, 2013, have left a permanent mark in the life of two families who could not have imagined that such a horrific event would occur,\" he said. \"Although I will be sentenced this morning to a term of imprisonment, the torment of these thoughts will occupy me throughout my existence on this earth.\"He added: \"Brandon played with my own three children regularly and was a guest in my home on many occasions, including many times for dinner. We considered him part of our family. I cannot begin to fathom the loss of any of my children. Therefore, I cannot imagine the depth of pain and sorrow that Ron and Christine experience on a daily basis.\"Christine Holt attempted to explain her pain in the same hearing last year, according to the Press. Holt said at the time that she was plagued by feelings of guilt.\"I still deal with it every day, that I couldn\u2019t protect him, I couldn\u2019t save him,\" she said. \"I would have done anything to be able to.\"The judge imposing the prison sentence noted that the shooting dealt a crushing blow to two families.\"Both sides are in great pain and are deeply suffering,\" he said, according to the Press.On Monday, in announcing the judgment, Superior Court Judge Robert E. Brenner scolded Anthony Senatore.\"To leave this rifle under the bed for five or six months, in this court\u2019s mind, is an act of willful or wanton disregard of the rights of another,\" the judge said, according to the Press. \"There were children in the house.\"Outside the Ocean City Courthouse, after the Holts were awarded $572,588.26, the slain boy\u2019s grandmother, Donna Elefante, declared: \"The money is not going to bring Brandon back.\"Asked by a reporter after the ruling if she could forgive Anthony Senatore, Christine Holt shook her head.\"I don\u2019t know if I can answer that,\" she said, noting that the ruling was about more than money.\"It\u2019s justice and it\u2019s also awareness,\" Brandon Holt\u2019s mother added. \"I just want everyone to know \u2014 just lock up your guns. Just lock up your guns.\"There appears to be no statistics keeping track of how many U.S. children fire a gun and intentionally or unintentionally harm someone. Yet, for many it feels like a month doesn't go by that we don't hear about a child pulling the trigger and killing someone with a firearm. These incidents have added fuel to the gun control debate.

One topic of discussion was the infamous SpaghettiO's tweet, in which the canned pasta's cartoon mascot asked followers to \"take a moment to remember #PearlHarbor with us.\"\"It sucks that the only survivors of Pearl Harbor are being mocked by the only food they can still chew,\" Leggero quipped.Several people started tweeting offense to Leggero's joke, which they took to be disrespectful to World War II veterans.@CarsonDaly @natashaleggero Making fun of Pearl Harbor Vets?

And she was not about to apologize. (Read her full response here.)I'm not sorry. I don\u2019t think the amazing courage of American veterans and specifically those who survived Pearl Harbor is in any way diminished by a comedian making a joke about dentures on television. Do we really believe that the people who fought and defended our freedom against Nazis and the Axis powers will find a joke about Spaghetti O's too much to bear? Sorry, I have more respect for Veterans than to think their honor can be impugned by a glamorous, charming comedian in a fur hat.She went on to question the motives of those who would express outrage over a joke, but not at the conditions that veterans face when returning from their service.On the other hand you have Veterans who receive inadequate care upon their return from active duty, rampant sexual assault against female soldiers, staggering rates of suicide, traumatic brain injury, PTSD, substance abuse and depression among soldiers and political gridlock that prevents these problems from getting solved quickly.The letter ended with a link to the Disabled American Veterans foundation with a call to donate money.Leggero instantly received accolades from fellow comedians for standing her ground.The episode gained attention largely due to the fact that comedians are increasingly faced with public and outsized reactions for their jokes, public and nonpublic, on social media. But apologies for jokes are rare, and non-apologies are even rarer. Last year, The Onion issued a rare apology for a joke at the expense of actress Quvenzhane Wallis. And in 2012, Dane Cook apologized for a joke about the Aurora mass shooting that he told at a comedy club soon after the tragedy.But Leggero's approach is more in line with that of Joan Rivers, who refused to apologize for a joke about the Holocaust she made on a red carpet last February. \"My husband lost the majority of his family at Auschwitz, and I can assure you that I have always made it a point to remind people of the Holocaust through humor,\" she said at the time.", "answers": {"answer_start": [9], "text": ["Natasha Leggero"]}, "id": "419530744873365504"}, {"question": "Chromecast 4K release date", "context": "We love Google's Chromecast , the minimalistic puck that plugs into the back of your TV and allows you to stream content from your phone or tablet.Smart devices, as it turns out, offer a pretty great interface for searching or browsing content. Plus, they offer easy access to an on-screen keyboard, and their app interfaces are fast and responsive. The same can't always be said for every TV's operating system, if they even have one at all.What Chromecast manages to achieve is combining this easy-to-use interface with a big-screen TV in a reliably quick and convenient way.There's just one problem, and that's resolution.But there's a good chance that's all about to change. Google has a major press event on October 4, and reports have begun to leak out about the ol' Mountain View team bringing Chromecast into the world of 3,840 x 2,160 Ultra HD resolution.So when will we finally get to see a 4K-equipped Chromecast, and when will it be released? Read on to find out.4K Chromecast release dateWe haven't had a firm announcement from Google that the company is even working on a 4K Chromecast, but the fact that the entire industry (including Google's streaming competitors) is moving towards the new resolution means that Google would be crazy to rest on its laurels.Recently, rumors surfaced that the company is planning to unveil a 4K Chromecast on October 4, alongside a new lineup of Pixel phonesNow, this isn't the first time we've heard rumblings about Google embracing UHD, but the recent well-spring of affordable 4K TV sets could be the compelling argument the company's been waiting for to pull the trigger.If that turns out to be the case, we'd expect to see it announced at the firm's upcoming October press event with potentially same-week availability. The last time Google announced a refresh of the Chromecast hardware, it was less than a week before we had one in our own home.4K Chromecast priceGoogle has always prided itself on the low cost of its Chromecast devices, which currently retail for $30 / \u00a330 / AU$59 for the video version and $35 / \u00a320 / AU$59 for the audio version.We wouldn't expect the new Chromecast to much exceed these existing prices, but with no official announcement from Google you should take our prediction with a pinch of salt.But here's our reasoning: video streaming boxes are so expensive because they handle all the processing on-board \u2013 they render the graphics, they take in the information from the online content and they have to output the result to your TV. It's a labor-intensive process. Plus they need an OS just hanging out in the background, waiting for you to press the home button so it can pop up like a waiter at a fine dining restaurant.Chromecast has always beaten its competition by limiting the number of components inside the box. It's not ever really responsible for rendering graphics \u2013 it's just taking a signal from your smart device and passing it on to your TV. It doesn't use an OS, so there's no need for a massive storage cache. What that means is that Google doesn't need to load up Chromecast 4K with tons of hardware \u2013 just a really good Wi-Fi antenna capable of passing more than 15mbps and the right codecs for 4K video.Does that mean it will cost a bit more than the original Chromecast? Probably. But does that also mean it should cast significantly less than the Amazon Fire TV and Roku 4? Absolutely.Conclusion: Is a 4K Chromecast just around the corner?Given Google's competitors have been moving in the direction of 4K for around a year now, it makes sense for the search giant to follow suit, and we wouldn't be surprised if we saw new Chromecast hardware in the first half of next year, if not sooner.The only problem is that enabling 4K functionality would likely require each Chromecast-enabled app developer to update their software to support the new resolution, which will inevitably take some time.But regardless of whether the new hardware gets announced on October 4 or not, we're certain a 4K Chromecast is going to make an appearance at some point.Article continues below", "answers": {"answer_start": [713], "text": ["October 4"]}, "id": "53tyqu"}, {"question": "This is what Chicken McNuggets are made of according to McDonald's", "context": "It's something you've probably wondered far too often when chowing down on McDonald's Chicken Nuggets -- what are these actually made of?

First of all, hangovers aren\u2019t killing anyone, so there\u2019s no sense of dread or looming obligation to fix the issue. Secondly, hangovers (ostensibly) keep people from over-indulging in alcohol, which is a good thing, and create a sort of intrinsic deterrent from overindulging.But in refusing to so much as poke at the issue, the absence of academic discussion of what causes (or prevents) a hangover has led to a jumble of pseudoscience, anecdotal remedies, and outright nonsense. Wanting to hang his hat on some progress on this front, Richard Stephens oat Keel University created the Alcohol Hangover Research Group, which sounds like a nickname for a fraternity, but is actually a collective of scientists and doctors working to figure this thing out.While it\u2019s still not definitively proven, it\u2019s believed that hangovers come as a result of the chemistry of the drinks. Fermentation of alcohol creates congeners that poison us. It\u2019s believed that darker liquors contain more congeners, which actually lend liquors their color, to a degree. So the notion of \"clearer drink, clearer head\" holds up...to a point.Regardless of what you imbibe, the alcohol is broken down to an acetate and the metabolites trigger sickness, sweating, and lethargy. You also suffer inflammation because your body thinks you\u2019re warding off sickness. That inflammation also can lead to those notaries headaches. These are chemical functions of metabolizing alcohol, and very little can be done to circumvent them for a pain-free morning.But if that\u2019s the case, then why do 23% of people, as found in this study, claim to never suffer hangovers? Are one in four people lying?Not likely. It\u2019s probable that those immune to the nasty morning-after effects are genetically predisposed to doing so. Studies have shown that twins have a tendency to share this trait much more than two unrelated people do. So, unfortunately, if you\u2019ve experienced a severe hangover before, you\u2019re likely not among those immune, and barring some serious genetic work, you never will be.You can take a page out of the playbook from many who suffer from lessened hangovers, though, by pacing yourself. It\u2019s been found that those who drink for long periods of time but regulate their consumption to hover around .10% suffer far less in the way of hangovers than those who get a more aggressive with their booze intake.Stephens says that the belief that hangovers get worse as you get older is a fallacy as well, stating, \"It\u2019s a very commonly held perception that we suffer worse hangovers as we get older, but there\u2019s no evidence for it. Hangovers are largely a young person\u2019s problem.\" He attributes this to older folks knowing how much to drink and how to pace, whereas younger people do not or choose not to.As those looking for a surefire cure may have feared, common sense remains the most effective weapon in fighting hangovers. Don\u2019t drink too much, and you won\u2019t get one. But that almost certainly won\u2019t stop people from crafting their own cures and theories in the hopes that hangovers are something that can be beaten.But this suggestion of an edible stinkbug helping your hangover might be an instance of a cure being worse than the disease.

Someone will probably support England if they are a fan of Wayne Rooney or if you fancy Cristiano Ronaldo, you are likely to support Portugal.The reasons vary from person to person. But deep down, we all have our favourite teams. This time around, Euro 2016 featured a total of 24 teams. After lucky wins, heartbreaking losses, thumping defeats and commanding victories, 20 of those teams were eliminated. Leaving only 4.Maybe your favourite team has already been knocked out, maybe it still survives, maybe it is heading towards glory. 5 days from now, the kings of Europe will be crowned.The throne has belonged toSpain for the last 8 years, but they are already out.So who will it be? How about the hosts France? The battling Portuguese? The underdogs Wales? Or world champions Germany?Let's break this down to understand which team stands where. We can start with the first semifinal that will be played between these two:Now, these two teams rely heavily on their superstar galacticos. And let's face it, they are two of the best in the world.Both were transferred for a record breaking fee to the biggest club in the world, Real Madrid. Both have amazing aerial & heading ability. Both have cannons in their feet when it comes to shooting from long ranges. And on their day, they can rip any team apart.But how have they fared in Euro 2016 so far?Based on the comparison, things look pretty equal. But apart from their talismans, the teams have been very different in their approach.While the Portuguese have Cristiano playing as a striker and not on the wing, he does not see much of the ball and it also exempts him from taking on too many defenders.Bale on the other hand is playing in his natural position and with his speed and body strength, he is pretty hard to catch. Also, his free kicks have been fairly accurate which makes him even more dangerous.Portugal have sort of relied of Ronaldo too much or on some moment of individual brilliance which, luckily for them, has come by in every match, through one man or another. But the Portuguese haven't won a single match in 90 minutes.They won one in extra time and one on penalties. But as long as they are winning it by luck, hook or crook, I don't think they will mind.Wales on the other hand has functioned more like a unit, a more balanced team which has seen them through some tough games. They defeated the best ranked team in Europe and the 2nd best team in the world, Belgium, by 3-1 and that too after being a goal down. No doubt their confidence will be soaring.If we go by the last game, both teams have a central defender in fine form. Pepe was surprisingly not hotheaded and spectacular with his tackles & clearances, while the Welsh captain, Ashley Williams, is not only stopping goals, he is scoring them too.So what can actually make the difference?Well, while Portugal's creative midfielder is in excellent form. (Talking about of course the 18-year-old Renato Sanches)Wales' play-maker Aaron Ramsey sadly has been suspended for their game against Portugal, which can really hurt the Welsh.There needs to be a player who can step up for Wales and dictate the game from central midfield. If not, that could actually be the difference between the two teams and give Portugal the edge.However, all of these stats and facts can be rendered useless if these two gentlemen run riot on the field. The other twenty will merely be spectators.The second semifinal features two heavyweights. The hosts and the world champions!These two teams rely more on their team play than individual brilliance, but that doesn't mean there can't be such moments that can leave you in awe. The French have not only been impeccable with their team play, they also have players performing to their potential individually as well.The top 3 scorers in Euro so far are French. Antoine Griezmann (4), Dmitri Payet (3) and Olivier Giroud (3). And not to forget, they have the irreplaceable Paul Pogba commanding the midfield and the man seems to be having a good tournament too.On the other hand, we have the world champions. They just knocked out the Italians, who had knocked out the defending champs. But the problem that the Germans will face is that they don't have a proper striker up front, as Mario Gomez has been ruled out because of injury while Mario Gotze isn't really in great touch at the moment.What's more, their main central defender, their wall - Matts Hummels has been suspended for the clash. And if you think their midfield is sorted, think again! Both Bastian Schweinsteiger & Sami Khedira are carrying injuries. But they do have this guy.And him.They can dictate the game when they are in their element. But a slip in the form can be dangerous. What works for them is that as Germans, they always find a way through. They always have a solution to the problems thrown at them.And well, you also have a manager who can dig his way out of any situation, so that helps.They had a tough time against the Italians, but managed to make it through.While the French made easy work of the Icelanders and thumped their way into the final with a 5-2 victory.The French haven't won in an international competition against the Germans since 1958. On the other hand, the Germans haven't won the Euro championship since 1996.It will probably be a game of good quality. Barring German suspensions and injuries, the hosts may also have an edge because of the support they will get from the public.Now let's talk about the possible finals that can take place.If the final sees these two teams:Cristiano Ronaldo will need to step up and play the game of his life. The Portuguese will again rely on their 18 year old talent to show some magic because CR7 won't be able to handle the likes of an experienced French defence alone.It goes without saying that players like Nani and Quaresma will need to be at their sharpest too. But the most important role I believe will lie with Pepe again. The French attack is cruising along at the moment, and it is imperative that Pepe takes the leading role in the back four.As far as the French are concerned, they have a strong midfield, a good defence, strikers in form and no injuries or suspensions (which can change after the semifinal).If they want, they can make easy work of a Portuguese outfit that isn't at its sharpest, but any slip up and the very same individual moment of Portuguese brilliance we talked about can hurt the hosts.If we witness this final:Well the battle will probably be a little similar to the one mentioned above. Portugal will have to play their heart out. They lack the experience of winning against world class teams, but they can be unstoppable on their day.The last time they met was in the world cup and Germany won 4-0. But that was 2 years ago. There have obviously been changes.For the Germans, they will be coming out after a win against the hosts and one of the tournament favourites. This will obviously be a huge motivating factor. Moreover, they will get players back from suspension and maybe a few healed injuries will also see them get a more balanced side.If they play with the spirit that helped them defeat the hosts (whatever it may be), they could see themselves lifting the trophy after 20 years.But what if we see this final:It is likely to be a very fast paced game. You have two of the best attacking wingers on both teams, who are both great with their delivery and hungry for goals.Ohh, and they are both great with free kicks too. If these two face-off, expect Payet and Bale to light up the field.For Wales, their central midfield will be sorted with Ramsey back in the team. But he is not the only player who will have to play the best game of his life to write the best underdog story of the Euros.They have the willpower to do it. They very well can. But being the underdogs and playing the hosts can be extremely unnerving.The French will have to worry about counter attacks from a fast paced Wales forward line. The one thing that really threatens their shot at the title is that Wales can play with the nothing-to-lose attitude while the French will be burdened with the weight of their country's hopes.This can obviously motivate them to get through too. With Pogba in his prime and Griezmann in fine scoring form, assists converted to goals can be a simple task. But we must never forget, it is never easy to play simple.If the above three don't happen, we will witness this one:A Wales side in their first final and a confident Gareth Bale after winning against his idol can be a very dangerous combination for any team in the world. There will be less pressure on the Welsh, since they will already be heroes in their country for reaching this far.Underdog stories aren't rare in this Euro edition and one last story can easily be written again.For Wales, chances will be rare to come by and conversions even more so. Germany has the best goalkeeper in Europe. Neuer has a knack of saving shots that seem destined for the net. And doing that to Wales can be really disheartening for the Welsh.Plus, it's not only the saves that they have to deal with. Wales will have to put up with a deadly midfield.Keep in mind that people like Gotze and Muller have a habit of turning up at the big stage. They haven't scored yet and will be hungry for some goals. Players who are generally good and are in fluctuating form can cause serious threats. They can do the unexpected.Let's hope, for our sake and for the sake of entertainment, something unexpected does happen.There you have it.

And now, after having personally used Fi for the better part of a year, I'm finding new ways it can make my life easier.Project Fi, if you aren't familiar, is Google's experimental wireless service for its own Nexus devices. It seamlessly switches your phone between a handful of networks -- Sprint, T-Mobile, and as of recently, U.S. Cellular -- to get you the best possible signal at any given time. It also taps into reliable public Wi-Fi networks (with its own layer of encryption in place) and uses those for your calls and data whenever it can.You pay only for the data you use each month -- at the same flat rate, even if you're roaming in a different country. It's an unusual arrangement that won't make sense for everyone, but if you're anything like me and my family, it could end up saving you some serious moolah.But hold the phone: There's more to Fi than just those basic benefits. Late last year, Google added an option for Fi subscribers to get data-only SIM cards that are tied to existing accounts. The idea is that you can pop a card into any SIM-supporting laptop or tablet and then get that device online at your same regular data rate, without any extra fees or complications.When I first heard about it, I thought: \"Hey, that's cool -- but I probably wouldn't use a feature like that very often.\" After all, laptops and tablets with SIM slots are relatively rare. And even if I had such a gadget in front of me, there just aren't a heck of a lot of situations in my day-to-day life where I need a large device with its own dedicated data connection.But then something struck me: Tablets and laptops aren't the only places where an option like this could be utilized. This feature's real value lies in something far broader and more useful -- something for which it isn't overtly advertised.The surrogate smartphoneThe inspiration hit whilst I was in the midst of a two-part experiment: one, spending a few days using my old 2013 phone for perspective, and two, thinking about ways I could use the word \"whilst\" in casual conversation.My old 2013 phone was the first-gen Moto X -- a device that's tiny by today's standards. In a lot of ways, I found returning to a phone of that size to be incredibly refreshing; while I generally enjoy my Nexus 6P, the truth is that it's always been a bit larger than I'd like. Particularly for times when I'm doing something active, it's just more bulk than I want in my pocket.Suddenly, a light bulb appeared over my head. After carefully taking it down (a floating glass bulb -- talk about a safety hazard!), I started thinking about the notion of using a smaller, older phone as a supplement to my 6P -- a surrogate smartphone, so to speak. If my dusty old device could somehow be tied to my regular cell number and service, I could grab it without any effort and stay connected while leaving my regular phone at home.With its excellent camera and always-up-to-date software, the 6P is obviously the superior device for most serious sorts of usage -- but whether I'm going to the gym, going for a bike ride, or going to do some random puttering about in the yard, there are plenty of occasions when I'd rather carry a device that's smaller, junkier, and just good enough to handle the basics without getting in the way. (Bonus: If I bang it against a weight, drop it during a run, or smudge it with a tasty coating of fresh mud, there's no need to worry.)Sure, I could move my main SIM card from one device to another when I want to make such a shift, but let's be honest: That's just enough of a pain in the ash that I wouldn't bother doing it after a while.But alas: I don't have to. And as it turns out, my surrogate smartphone scenario is just the tip of the iceberg. I'd actually stumbled onto something far more significant and versatile than I'd ever imagined.Single account, multiple phonesYou see where this is going, right? Whilst (!) thinking about the possibilities, my rapidly decaying brain somehow remembered Project Fi's data-only SIM option.\"Wait a second,\" I said to myself. \"That option may have been designed for tablets and laptops, but there's no reason it wouldn't work just as well with phones.\"\"Good point, jerkface. Now stop talking to yourself,\" I responded with a swift kick to the fibula.Once my internal quarreling subsided, I signed into the Fi website and placed an order for a data-only SIM card (for a grand total of $0 plus $0 shipping -- a price I can almost afford). And then I got to thinking about all the ways that little piece of plastic could come in handy.There's the casual-use surrogate smartphone situation we were just discussing, of course -- but the possibilities go much further. Think about it:1. You could use the same setup to create a functional phone for a kid -- without having to pay for an extra line.Provided you have an old Android phone sitting around -- or are willing to buy a cheap budget phone to fill that role -- just toss the Fi data SIM in, set the phone up for your youngin, and cackle at your cash-saving cleverness. Whether your offspring is using the phone here and there for \"educational\" game-playing and video-watching or taking it out and about to stay in touch from afar, it's an easy way to keep your kiddo connected on occasion without having to start up a new account and deal with all the accompanying ongoing fees.As long as the phone is compatible with T-Mobile's network (which Fi defaults to using whenever a device isn't designed for its typical network-switching magic), it'll be good to go -- and any mobile data used on it will just factor into your normal pay-as-you-go monthly pool. (You may have to make a few one-time tweaks to the device's network settings before things will work properly, but that's pretty easy to do.)Just be sure to see below for an important asterisk about the phone's call-making capabilities.2. You could use it to have a ready-to-go backup phone in case your primary device (or your significant other's) is ever missing, broken, or low on battery.There's nothing saying your surrogate smartphone has to be destined for any specific people or activities; you could just as easily keep it sitting around and ready to step in whenever the need arises. Think of it like a spare tire, only without any jacks or wrenches required.3. You could use it to create a dedicated hotspot that'll beam out mobile data access without draining your primary phone's power.Pop the SIM into any T-Mo-compatible phone -- or, heck, even a standalone hotspot device, if you want -- and fire it up without having to worry about running down your own phone's battery.The phone call question\"Ah, but wait! A data-only SIM won't let you make and receive calls, will it?\"Technically, no (and thanks for the timely interjection!) -- but fear not, my friend, for all you need is the free Google Hangouts Dialer app to get around that restriction. Hangouts Dialer makes it possible to place and receive calls from your regular Fi number; it just uses data instead of regular cellular minutes.As long as you have a solid connection, be it via mobile data or Wi-Fi, using Hangouts Dialer for phone calls should work flawlessly. I've been using the app to make calls in the car from my \"data-only\" surrogate smartphone, and people have actually remarked that the call quality sounds noticeably better than normal.If you want to get really crazy, you can also use Hangouts Dialer to place and receive calls from an alternate number -- even while you're actively signed into the device. All you have to do is set up the free Google Voice service on a secondary Google account, then add that account onto the phone. Find that account in the settings section of the Hangouts Dialer app and just make sure the option for it to receive incoming calls is checked and active.To place a call from that other number, open up Hangouts Dialer, tap the menu icon in the upper-left corner, and tap the circular avatar corresponding with the account you want. Any calls you place in Hangouts Dialer will now come from that account's associated number.(And yes, that means you could actually use this method to keep multiple phone numbers associated with your phone -- say, a \"work\" number and a \"home\" number -- and be able to place and receive calls from any of them, anytime. Go nuts.)Again, it's worth emphasizing: Regardless of how many SIM cards you get or what you do with your secondary device(s), all you'll pay for is any mobile data used in any given month -- just like you do now on your primary Fi phone. Using mobile data across multiple phones is effectively the same as using that same amount of data on a single device.The only difference is the added convenience and versatility -- and I don't know about you, but that's something I'll happily accept.[SEE ALSO: How to get free home phone service from Google]", "answers": {"answer_start": [3954], "text": ["Single account, multiple phones"]}, "id": "50t54q"}, {"question": "You may be surprised by who's filming amateur porn", "context": "This week we've learned that the people watching porn aren't all single, lonely men -- and neither are the people uploading it.Amateur porn website Homegrown Video (NSFW link) cataloged all video submissions they received over a six-month period.

Norton Point\u2019s solution? Use that plastic junk to make dope sunglasses.This Wednesday, as part of World Oceans Day, Norton Point will launch their first line of sunglasses made from recovered consumer ocean plastics as part of their #SeaPlasticDifferently campaign. With plastic collected from Haiti, the glasses not only look cool, but promote sustainable business practices.Elite Daily had a chance to speak with Ryan Schoenike about the process of developing a product from our plastic waste and growing an eco-friendly company.After linking up with a college buddy in March of last year, Schoenike and his partner came up with the idea to source ocean plastic for a unique line of eyewear. But despite the shocking amount of garbage in our marine ecosystem, he admits gathering it wasn\u2019t as easy as they expected, saying,One of the issues we had found early on was that ocean plastic is this big problem and it\u2019s really prevalent, but it\u2019s really hard to get a hold of some ocean plastic. There just aren\u2019t people that are collecting it. Certainly, there are beach cleanups that happen a lot and stuff like that, but nobody\u2019s collecting the material, sorting through it and then either saving it or processing it in a way that allows you to turn it into a product.After spending a few months figuring out how to overcome that initial hurdle, they discovered a plastic collection company in Haiti called the Plastic Bank. Schoenike says,They work with local communities and local collectors on the ground in Haiti to make sure that they receive a fair wage or a living wage for the plastic they collect.Right away, they began building a partnership and testing samples. From there, they developed a relationship with the Ocean Conservancy, an organization that happened to be looking for an opportunity to unload the plastic they pick up as part of their extensive cleanup operation. As Schoenike explains,Our goal is to create fashionable, high-quality eyewear to prove that people will buy that eyewear and show the value in ocean plastic. Another issue is that we\u2019re not collecting it because there\u2019s no perceived value in it. It\u2019s much more expensive to use and it\u2019s a lot harder to process. But, we\u2019re hoping by showing that people will make the choice to buy... the ocean plastic pair over the other ones.Beyond reusing plastic waste, Norton Point plans to invest in the communities they collect from as well. The company plans to reinvest five percent of the proceeds to education, cleanup and mediation activities. And while this first line of sunglasses isn\u2019t manufactured from 100 percent ocean plastic (as that would be nearly impossible, says Schoenike), the company plans to invest in innovation so each new line will incorporate increasing amounts of plastic waste.Because the Norton Point team has invested so much time and energy into researching plastic waste, we asked how we could be doing better to prevent the problem in the first place. Beyond ditching plastic water bottles in favor of reusable ones, Schoenike says,Consumers have power to demand the companies they buy from be more responsible in thinking about their plastic footprint.And on an everyday level, Schoenike says plastic straws are something we typically forget about but can be easily avoided to lessen our footprint.In keeping with the sustainable approach, Norton Point will offer an end-of-life buy back program so if anything is ever wrong with your glasses, the company will buy them back and offer 10 percent off the next pair. And that\u2019s how it comes full circle.You can pre-order your own pair of Norton Point sunglasses starting June 8 on their website.

According to a study published in the March 2015 issue of Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, nail biters are more likely to be perfectionists.Now, you may expect someone who aims for perfection to have immaculately polished nails, but that's not the case, says Dr. Kieron O'Conner, the study's author. Perfectionists are often so focused on results, that they aren't able to relax, and they overwork themselves. \"They are therefore prone to frustration, impatience, and dissatisfaction when they do not reach their goals,\" she explained. And that can lead to nail biting, apparently.The researchers had a group of 48 people, half of them chronic nail biters, fill out surveys that evaluated their \"experienced emotions.\" They were then exposed to situations designed to provoke specific feelings, such as stress and boredom. In the end, they concluded that perfectionists are more likely to feel restless when there's nothing to do, and biting their nails is an outlet for this impatience.The bottom line? The results suggest that if you want to stop biting your nails, you should work on being less of a perfectionist, and reducing feeling of boredom and frustration. \"We look at all the thoughts and behaviors present in situations at high risk for the habit and change them through cognitive therapy to more resemble the thoughts and behaviors in low risk situations,\" O'Connor explained to the Huffington Post.

George Lucas was still talking about the prequels, but he made it clear that they wouldn\u2019t be released anytime soon. (Lucas, at one point, said that he wanted to take two years off, then start production on \"Episode I,\" with an eventual release date of 1988. \"Episode I\" was finally released in 1999.) Children of that era (ahem) were already so scattershot with their attention spans, that they had moved on to G.I. Joe and Transformers for entertainment. By 1985, \"Power of the Force\"-labeled \"Star Wars\" action figures warmed retail-store pegs. (Which, today, are some of the most valuable because absolutely nobody bought them at the time.)Nineteen Eighty-Four marked what would become the death throes for action-adventure movies set in space. There had been a flood of lesser movies trying to capitalize on the tone set by the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy: there was \"Krull,\" \"The Last Starfighter,\" \"Megaforce,\" and even a little-known gem that tried to capitalize on both \"Star Wars\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" titled, of course, \"Space Raiders.\"And, front and center, waving its space herpes-infected death rattle, was \"The Ice Pirates,\" which turns 30 years old on Sunday.\"The Ice Pirates\" remains a bit of an anomaly today. In an age of unabashed nostalgia for anything, \"The Ice Pirates\" is largely unmentioned and unloved. Which is odd because \"The Ice Pirates\" was extremely popular with the 9 year olds of 1984. (I speak from experience.) Before I re-watched \"The Ice Pirates\" this week, the only thing I really remembered was a machine that would slice off a person\u2019s scrotum with big chomping teeth (in fourth grade, this scene was discussed with an almost unhealthy resolve).Having now re-watched \"The Ice Pirates\" \u2013- and now being the same age that my father was when he took me to see \"The Ice Pirates\" \u2013- a lot of things about my relationship with my father, as it pertains to our personal tastes concerning popular culture, makes a lot more sense now.The first movie my parents ever took me to see in a theater was \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" The next year, in 1981, they took me to see a re-release of the original \"Star Wars.\" I know my father wasn\u2019t a particular fan of \"Star Wars,\" but he tolerated it because they are genuinely entertaining movies. It\u2019s when \"The Last Starfighter\" and \"The Ice Pirates\" came along -- movies that he, like so many others, thought were garbage -- that my father checked out. \"The Ice Pirates\" is a movie that only a 9-year-old could like \u2013- and that\u2019s why these types of movies died. (And, really, 9 year olds didn\u2019t like \"The Ice Pirates\" -\u2013 they just liked that it reminded them of \"Star Wars.\")In 1977, space movies were getting nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. By 1984, \"space movies\" were dumb.Like I said, I re-watched \"The Ice Pirates\" and, hoo boy, what a weird thing. The gist is a band of pirates \u2013- led by Robert Urich as Jason (doing his best Han Solo impression), along with fellow pirates that include Anjelica Huston and Ron Perlman \u2013- comb the galaxy looking for water. Okay! Not a bad premise! But Jason's pirates actually wear pirate costumes. And they have swords. Not laser swords, but just regular swords. In space.This movie is insane. Jason and his team wind up being captured, then they are strapped onto some sort of assembly line that leads them to the dreaded scrotum-chomp machine \u2013- you know, for kids -\u2013 before having to pretend they were castrated (they avoid the scrotum-chomp machine\u2019s wrath) at some sort of elaborate space debutante ball.Love scene dialogue includes gems like Jason saying, \"I should take my saber off.\" The princess (Mary Crosby) responds, \"Let me. You\u2019re so stiff. The belt, I mean.\" (This is such a perfect euphemism because, if belts are known for anything, it\u2019s being stiff?)\"The Ice Pirates\" ends with (I swear I am not making this up) an elaborate fight scene as their spaceship travels through a time warp. The time warp causes all of the characters to age so much that, during this fight, Jason\u2019s son is conceived, born, becomes an adult, and literally swoops in to save a now-elderly Jason. Oh, and Bruce Vilanch shows up.(I should take a moment to point out that the director of \"The Ice Pirates\" is Stewart Raffill, the same man who directed \"Mac and Me\" and has supplied Paul Rudd with a lifetime of talk-show movie clips. So, Raffill can take full credit for restoring the \"cute and nice alien\" movie trend, too.)The thing is, I don\u2019t think anyone involved in \"The Ice Pirates\" really took it that seriously in the first place. It\u2019s just bad timing that it came out when it did \u2013 followed by the slightly more serious, but still fun \"The Last Starfighter -- because there really was a real opportunity to create new action-adventure stories that were set in space. It just so happened that no one quite knew how to pounce on the opening left by \"Star Wars.\" (I am not forgetting the \"Star Trek\" movies, but those already had an established fan base before \"Star Wars\" and, with the exception of \"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,\" kind of lived in their own insular world.)That\u2019s not to say there wasn\u2019t sci-fi, but the space adventures in theaters seemed, for all purposes, dead. Now, television picked up the slack. So much, in fact -\u2013 with shows like \"Firefly\" and \"Battlestar Galactica -- that you may not even realize the dearth (other than the \"Star Wars\" prequels and \"Star Trek\" movies) that was levied upon the space opera.In the last year, things have changed dramatically. It\u2019s easy to point at \"Gravity\" as a turning point for these types of movies. And it certainly helps, but its action still occurs pretty close to Earth and -\u2013 as unbelievable as some scenes may actually be \u2013- it\u2019s still based in at least some sort of hyper-stylized version of reality.The real test is Marvel\u2019s \"Guardians of the Galaxy.\" Sort of. I mean, it is the very definition of the kind of action-adventure movie this entire piece has been about, but it\u2019s also a Marvel movie set in the current \"Iron Man,\" \"Thor,\" Captain America,\" \"Avengers\" timeline. So, even if a person were not normally going to see \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" movie, they\u2019re probably going to think, Well, it\u2019s a sequel to \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier,\" so I need to see it. It\u2019s a test, but the true test comes for whatever, if anything, tries to follow \"Guardians\" (not counting \"Star Wars: Episode VII\").Whatever it is, let\u2019s just hope it\u2019s not a remake of \"The Ice Pirates\" ...

Here are the basics. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)Savage replied that a friend in college had been diagnosed with PCOS. She was surprised when the doctor responded that she suspected Savage might have it, too.An explanation at lastPCOS is a common hormonal imbalance that often begins in puberty and affects as many as 10 percent of women. Its cause is unknown, but heredity appears to play a role: Women whose mothers or sisters have the disorder are at higher risk. Many women with PCOS have enlarged ovaries containing fluid-filled cysts that produce excess androgens \u2014 male sex hormones, which interfere with ovulation. Other signs of PCOS include irregular, absent or prolonged periods, acne and excess facial and body hair, a condition known as hirsutism.Because it also disrupts the regulation of insulin, many women with PCOS are overweight or obese. The disorder, which can be controlled but not cured, also increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart attack.[Doctors dismissed his pain as migraines. Then they said he had 24 hours to live.]The gynecologist told Savage that she also suffered from PCOS. When Savage asked whether it was possible to test for the disorder, she said that the gynecologist told her, erroneously, that there were no tests. The best way to treat the problem was to lose weight, the doctor advised. And, the gynecologist added, she held weight-loss seminars in her office and urged Savage to sign up.Savage declined. Two weeks later, she consulted a third OB/GYN, Neil Horlick, who practices in Montgomery and Frederick counties.Horlick, after taking her history and performing an exam, said he suspected she had PCOS. When Savage told him she had been told there was no test for it, he assured her that testing was available and that he would order it.Because abnormalities of the thyroid or adrenal glands can cause similar symptoms, those must be ruled out first. PCOS is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion, made on the basis of blood tests, a patient\u2019s symptoms and an ultrasound of the ovaries.[At first, this man thought he had food poisoning. It turned out to be something far worse.]\"We generally look for two out of three criteria for PCOS,\" Horlick said. These include a history of irregular or absent periods, elevated levels of male hormones, particularly testosterone, and the presence of ovarian cysts. In Savage\u2019s case, an ultrasound showed no cysts, but she did have an elevated testosterone level.Horlick said he was surprised that Savage\u2019s condition went undiagnosed for so long. \"PCOS is always on our radar\" when a patient with irregular periods complains of weight gain and hirsutism, Horlick said.He told Savage that her best chance of getting pregnant involved losing weight. Horlick prescribed metformin, a diabetes drug that can promote weight loss. Metformin is commonly given to PCOS patients and may help promote ovulation as well.Savage decided to take a new approach to food. She began following a paleo diet, which emphasizes meat, vegetables, nuts and fruit, and drastically reduces the intake of carbohydrates, sugar and processed foods.The first month, she said, she was elated to discover that she had lost 15 pounds; between April and September, she shed 50 pounds and her cholesterol dropped 20 points. Her acne also improved, her level of testosterone dropped, and her menstrual cycle became more regular.Savage said she asked relatives whether anyone else had been diagnosed with PCOS. \"My parents had never heard of it,\" she said.In October 2015, she and her husband were elated to learn that she was pregnant with identical twin boys. Savage spent six weeks hospitalized at Maryland\u2019s Shady Grove Medical Center under close observation, because her twins have a rare condition in which they share a single amniotic sac and placenta, a condition unrelated to PCOS. The babies were born April 22.Savage said she hopes that her experience will spare other women from \"struggling for years the way I did.\"\"This isn\u2019t a bizarre disorder,\" she said. \"It shouldn\u2019t take [this many] doctors to find out, when I have a textbook case.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [4730], "text": ["Polycystic ovarian (or ovary) syndrome"]}, "id": "4jqc7e"}, {"question": "You Probably Won\u2019t Be Able to Guess What Michael Douglas\u2019s Son Has Tattooed on His Abdomen", "context": "Michael Douglas's son Cameron was recently released after spending almost seven years in prison on drug charges, and he's been celebrating his newfound freedom by posting pictures of what Us Weekly appropriately calls his \"buff, post-prison bod\" to Instagram.

Not, say, LeBron James, who signed a big \"content creation\" deal with Warner Bros. Entertainment one month after the studio filed new trademarks on \"Space Jam,\" and who has made no secret of his interest in exploring that world, saying that \"we\u2019re definitely missing Bugs and Daffy and Tasmanian Devil and every last one of them, so hopefully we can do some great things.\"Here\u2019s where we remind you that Blake\u2019s a Jordan Brand athlete, and that MJ\u2019s not exactly shy about getting in plugs for his dudes or his brand wherever he can.That said, the Los Angeles Clippers All-Star\u2019s certainly a reasonable enough choice for the gig. While many other NBA players will surely lobby for a role in a new \"Space Jam\" flick, few would figure to have Griffin\u2019s bona fides.Remember, the former Funny or Die intern and sometimes stand-up has actually stepped into Mike\u2019s Air Jordans before, taking on the M.J. role in a staged table read of the \"Space Jam\" script at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Los Angeles in 2014:On top of that, Griffin also made it clear last summer that he\u2019d love to be involved in any \"Space Jam\" sequel/reboot during an interview with Alex Kennedy of Basketball Insiders:Basketball Insiders: Well, there is one movie everyone can imagine you in and that\u2019s \"Space Jam 2.\" Your recent Marvin the Martian commercial got some \"Space Jam\" fans excited.

I\u2019d love to be involved in any capacity, really. \u2018Space Jam\u2019 was a huge part of my childhood. I actually had a \"Space Jam\"-themed birthday party as a teen. Then, when I turned 21, my friends got me a \u2018Space Jam\u2019 cake again just to re-live the glory days. It has been a big thing for me so being able to be involved in any capacity would be great, even just being one of the guys that\u2019s in there would be cool. I think it would be a lot of fun.

If it advises you to keep it in the fridge, then do so, otherwise keep it in an airtight container.But when co-presenter Matt Tebbut did a taste test, he found that the coffee which had been kept in a container out of the fridge tasted like 'freshly brewed coffee', while the coffee which had been kept in the fridge did not.That's because the aromas of other food in the fridge can muddy the flavours of the coffee.

But for me, and thousands of other women like me, it is the reason we have to work harder to be able to earn, succeed, and claim our power like men can.Two years ago, I was working as the director of operations of a research institute at a major university while finishing my MBA in the evenings. When I got pregnant, I assumed combining motherhood with my professional life would be easy. I also assumed I would have access to paid maternity leave. While I had worked full-time for over two years, I was originally hired as a consultant and had only been an official employee for 23 months \u2014 one month shy of qualifying for six weeks paid leave. In this, I was far from alone: just another one of the 88% of women in the U.S. who don\u2019t have access to paid maternity leave. When I got pregnant, I assumed combining motherhood with my professional life would be easy. I also assumed I would have access to paid maternity leave.I was, however, entitled to 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). I was lucky. Approximately 60% of employees \u2014 those who work full-time for at least one year for a company with at least 50 staff members \u2014 are eligible for unpaid leave. The remaining 40% are not guaranteed any time off, paid or unpaid. Not even one single day to give birth.I worked for a professor who travelled frequently and whom I rarely saw in person. Many of our staff members were located at campuses abroad, and much of our work was done via Skype. I had worked remotely from rural Ghana many times before, and could have easily worked from my apartment. When I first discussed flexible working and telecommuting, my boss was open to the idea. As my due date neared, he changed his mind.I started to visit day care centers in Manhattan, and was shocked to learn that monthly rates were anywhere from $1,900 to $2,900. In fact, in 28 states and the District of Columbia, the average annual cost for an infant in day care is higher than a year\u2019s tuition and fees at a four-year public college. Fees for two children in day care are higher than the average annual rent in every state. I added my name to a number of waitlists, and was eventually offered a part-time place at one center. My boss still would not consider a flexible work schedule, and my daughter, now 2 years old, is still waiting on that full-time list.I worked until my water broke, trying to save the little paid sick and vacation time that I had. After 23 hours of labor, my daughter was born via an emergency c-section. I took my baby home and was grateful that I at least had the time to recover. Giving birth is a physically grueling event, and too many women are forced to go back to work while they\u2019re still bleeding, have stitches, and can barely walk.I worked until my water broke, trying to save the little paid sick and vacation time that I had.Over the next 12 weeks, I had regular panic attacks at the thought of handing my baby over to strangers. At three months, she wasn\u2019t sleeping through the night, had only had one round of vaccines, was nursing every hour, and still very much needed me. As much as I loved my job, I chose to resign. In that, too, I was far from alone. For the first time since the women\u2019s liberation movement of the 1970s, the share of mothers who choose to stay at home rather than return to work after their children are born has been increasing \u2014 it has now reached 29%. While 71 countries provide paid paternity leave, there are only two countries that don\u2019t offer any paid federal maternity leave: the United States and Papua New Guinea. Like many women who find themselves stifled by this country's inflexible work options, I wanted to work. But I couldn\u2019t justify leaving my infant. So, when my daughter was a year old, I finished my MBA, left the city, and moved my family to Long Island, so we could be closer to my mom, who was able to help out.We knew we wanted to have another baby but still wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to spend $5,000 a month on day care. I also still wouldn\u2019t be ready to leave our second baby at just 12 weeks. I was terrified that I was giving up my career that I worked so hard to buildterrified that I wouldn\u2019t be able to find consulting work from home, that there would be a break in my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. I was worried that I would eventually be \"mommy-tracked,\" viewed only as someone\u2019s mommy, rather than as a serious professional.While staying home with our daughter \u2014 and now infant son \u2014 was the best decision I could have made, I still lost out financially. I was lucky enough to find consulting work from home in my field, and I can run down from my office to nurse my babies anytime my mother calls, but I lost retirement contributions, paid sick and vacation leave, as well as the social aspect of grabbing a cup of coffee with a colleague without a demanding, sticky little human hanging off my body.I was terrified that I was giving up my career that I worked so hard to buildthat there would be a break in my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.Our country\u2019s antiquated parental leave policy dates back to when men were the sole breadwinners who could easily support a family while women stayed home to care for the children. It ignores the fact that today two incomes are usually needed to make ends meet, that many women enjoy their careers, and that even when working full-time, women spend twice as much time as men do on child care. Studies have repeatedly shown that paternity leave helps fathers bond with their infants and take more responsibility in child care. It also promotes gender equality and helps keep women connected to the workforce and contributing to the economy. It\u2019s time for the U.S. to catch up to the rest of the world, and provide paid parental leave \u2014 for both mothers and fathers.

The increase in availability of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act is expected to reduce the number of preventable heart attacks and strokes in younger people, Frieden said.To prevent more deaths from heart disease and stroke, health care systems can use electronic health records to identify patients who smoke or have high blood pressure and cholesterol so that doctors can follow their progress toward heart-healthy behaviors, the CDC said.Communities can promote tobacco-free areas and help ensure access to healthy foods, the CDC said.

Typically, this often describes those on the right of the political spectrum, where climate change, women\u2019s reproductive health, and even evolution are routinely dismissed. But a massive and fast growing field in science\u2014behavioral genetics\u2014has a huge body of conclusive evidence that, at first reading, seems at odds with left-wing ideology.This week, Robert Plomin, professor of behavioral genetics at King\u2019s College London, published a paper showing that a child\u2019s educational success can be predicted by their genes. Genetic data from 20,000 DNA variants across several genes collectively account for 10% of the differences in children\u2019s educational achievement age 16. At the most extreme ends of this genetic variation is an entire exam grade difference\u2014from A to B grade for those with the highest polygenic score, to B to C grade for those with the lowest.The notion that success at school could be so influenced by genes is uncomfortable for those who uphold the view that anyone can do or achieve anything they put their mind to. But Plomin\u2019s paper is far from the only publication showing such results. Meta-analysis of 61 twin studies shows that genetic variation accounts for 66% of educational achievement at primary school level.One set of identical twins raised apart shared many similarities\u2014including flushing the toilet before using it, wearing rubber bands on their wrists, reading magazines from back to front, and dipping their toast in coffee. And, disquieting though that may be, twin studies have time and again highlighted other aspects of ourselves that seem to be shaped by genes. Nancy Segal, evolutionary psychologist and behavioral geneticist at California State University who has written And, disquieting though that may be, twin studies have time and again highlighted other aspects of ourselves that seem to be shaped by genes. Nancy Segal, evolutionary psychologist and behavioral geneticist at California State University who has written several books on twin studies , says the research suggests that about 50% of individual differences in personality are affected by genetic variation.Specific examples of twins who were separated at birth and raised apart show that even our personal quirks have a genetic basis. The two-decade long Minnesota Twin Study, which began in 1983, revealed many such cases\u2014including that of identical twins Oskar and Jack. While Oskar grew up in Nazi Germany as a Catholic who took part in Nazi youth, and Jack grew up Jewish in the Caribbean and spent part of his childhood on an Israeli kibbutz, they shared many similarities \u2014including flushing the toilet before using it, wearing rubber bands on their wrists, reading magazines from back to front, and dipping their toast in coffee.Segal also mentions the example of twins Jerry and Mark, raised separately, who both grew up to be firemen, and who both enjoy Budweiser and hold their drink of choice with their pinkie finger underneath the can.\"There\u2019s not a gene for doing that sort of thing, but the twin studies force us to consider other explanations,\" says Segal. \"Could it be that they worry about spilling things, that their hands are made in such a way that they\u2019re more comfortable holding the can that way? Even our quirky habits are not just a matter of random chance but have a real scientific basis in our genetics.\"So we can\u2019t be anything we choose?Though these scientific findings could be alarming for anyone, the seemingly deterministic perspective seems to contradict the left-wing emphasis on the role of privilege in any person\u2019s success.There is, after all, no doubt that the environment plays a massive role in our personal achievement. Wealthy children aged 5 with low cognitive abilities are 35% more likely to be high-earners as adults than highly able children from poor families. In the UK, those who went to private school make up just 7% of the population but almost a third of parliament. Money, which often brings access to a stable home, small class sizes, and excellent education, undeniably buys success.Both Segal and Saskia Selzam, lead researcher on Plomin\u2019s paper, say that they\u2019ve experienced the same. \"Everyone has their own sets of beliefs. Some people ignore data even when other people are persuaded by it,\" says Segal. The evidence is building at such a pace that both say the public seem to have become more accepting over the past couple of years. But though the scientific findings in molecular genetics don\u2019t directly contradict this, many who care deeply about the effects of privilege seem to flinch at the research. I\u2019ve spoken to people with no knowledge of the scientific literature but a strong political perspective who insist that such studies about the role of genes simply cannot be true.Both Segal and Saskia Selzam, lead researcher on Plomin\u2019s paper, say that they\u2019ve experienced the same. \"Everyone has their own sets of beliefs. Some people ignore data even when other people are persuaded by it,\" says Segal. The evidence is building at such a pace that both say the public seem to have become more accepting over the past couple of years.\"The left-wing view is that everyone\u2019s born the same and you can make everyone achieve the same way. From genetics research, we\u2019ve shown that\u2019s not true.\" But the belief that anyone can be anything they choose\u2014that you could take a child and train them towards literally any goal with success is, says Segal, \"such an old-fashioned notion, with absolutely no backing whatsoever.\" But the belief that anyone can be anything they choose\u2014that you could take a child and train them towards literally any goal with success is, says Segal, \"such an old-fashioned notion, with absolutely no backing whatsoever.\"After all, she points out, if she wanted to be a world champion sumo wrestler, the chances are \"pretty unlikely\" given her height and weight. \"Genetics sets some realistic limits,\" she says.But Selzam says it\u2019s important not to bury our heads in the sand and ignore the evidence. \"The left-wing view is that everyone\u2019s born the same and you can make everyone achieve the same way. From genetics research, we\u2019ve shown that\u2019s not true,\" she says. But understanding this can be hugely beneficial for those who are struggling to achieve but don\u2019t know why.For example, she says there\u2019s been a strong educational emphasis on grit and perseverance\u2014but genetics research shows that this personality trait only predicts 5% of why individuals differ. So over-emphasizing it will have moderately little effect and, in making children feel they\u2019re not trying hard enough, might well make many miserable.Also, it\u2019s important to note that just because educational achievement is genetically influenced, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s determined by genetics. Selzam gives a comparable example of someone who\u2019s genetically at risk of dyslexia. If that child is treated like everyone else then, chances are, they will go on to develop the disorder. But if you identify that they\u2019re at genetic risk then, through tutoring and one-on-one support, it\u2019s possible to counter that genetic disposition through \"environmental engineering.\"The evidence is buildingBehavioral genetics is an extremely fast-developing science, the \"fastest developing science in human existence,\" says Selzam. Human DNA was only decoded 16 years ago, and so researchers have been rushing ahead from that starting point, with rapidly developing technological and methodical advances. Meanwhile, projects with huge sample sizes (Selzam\u2019s own paper relied on research from a study of 293,700 people ) allow researchers to find increasingly detailed results.And though the field may be unnerving, the findings have many practical benefits. Segal suggests that understanding our genetics can help someone with depression find the most suitable therapeutic regime, or explain why an overweight person struggles to lose weight. \"You can find explanations for things that help you plan for the future and alter your lifestyle appropriately,\" she says.Selzam says she hopes her work can help create personalized education \"so that we acknowledge and understand individual differences and work towards creating equal opportunities for children based on who they are.\"Decoding our genetics can highlight our individual risks and resilience.

You are University of Michigan running back Drake Johnson. It's April 13, 2016, and you're working out at a school facility. You've suffered two torn knee ligaments in preceding years, and today, you are run over by a forklift.Normally, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) would swarm like a bunch of Midwestern starlings following this sort of workplace accident; after all, five of the state of Michigan's 31 workplace fatalities in 2015 were forklift-related. Only this\u2014ahem\u2014is amateur college sports, which means OSHA doesn't have jurisdiction. Nor do workers' compensation laws require the school to pay your medical bills.Oh, and since the National Labor Relations Board last year declined to rule on a case involving the unionization of Northwestern University football players, you don't have a union rep to look out for your interests, either.In short, you have no power, and fewer protections than someone serving popcorn in the stands at Michigan Stadium. You are wholly at the mercy of Michigan's whims. Maybe the school will do right by you. Maybe it won't.According to Michigan, Johnson is healed and healthy . Still, such is life for a revenue-sport athlete in a Power Five conference: your blood, sweat, and labor helps generate billions in annual television revenue, and hundreds of millions more in shoe and apparel deals, like the recent 11-to-15-year deal between Nike and Michigan that could be worth as much as $173.8 million. Yet only a small portion of that income reaches you, because you are not considered a school employee. Your work is not work, your rights are not valid. Your only real recourse is to wait on a series of complicated, protracted antitrust lawsuits that have been filed against the National Collegiate Athletic Association.Or is it?In the ongoing fight for college athletes' rights, there's a powerful weapon hiding in plain sight\u2014a tool that athletes could start using right now to improve their lot, and force meaningful change. It's something that requires neither lawyers nor money, highlights the hypocrisies of the NCAA system, is far less risky than a playing strike, and turns the overwhelming economic power of schools against them in a nifty bit of protest jujitsu.If players like Johnson want to shake up the status quo, all they need to do is start spatting.What's spatting? Well, it's kind of like when marching bands whiten their shoes and ankles. Or when Nike endorser Michael Jordan used an American flag to cover over the Reebok logo on his Team USA uniform at the 1992 Barcelona Games medal ceremony. Or when Georgetown University athletes reportedly protested labor conditions at Nike's overseas factories last year.For a formal definition, let's consult Nike's 2015 contract with the University of Texas, which reads:\"... the 'polishing-out', 'spatting', or taping or in any way altering NIKE football shoes in any manner so as to cover or obscure any portion of any NIKE Logo is inconsistent with the purpose of this Agreement ... and a consistent pattern of spatting in any Contract Year is a material breach of this Agreement.\"And there you have it. Taping, painting, or otherwise obscuring the corporate logos on your college sports uniform\u2014that's spatting. A simple, highly visible form of protest that's guaranteed to get the immediate, urgent attention of any major athletic department. The media, too. Because spatting will hit the college sports industry where it hurts most: right in the pocketbook.Let's go back to that Nike-Texas contract. It also states that:\"... for each game in which 5 or more shoes [not pairs, but individual shoes] appear on-field (in game action) polished-out, spatted, or taped for any reason [excluding medical reason], Nike shall have the right to reduce annual scheduled Base compensation by $20,000 per shoe (in excess of five shoes) ... up to a maximum of $100,000.\"Read that again. We're taking $20,000 per shoe. If only five Texas players spat a total of ten shoes, the school could lose $100,000 of its annual compensation from Nike. But wait, there's more! According to the same contract, Nike has the right to a $30,000 clawback for each subsequent occurrence, which means that if five players spat for two games, the shoe company could dock Texas a cool $250,000.Lots of logo$. Photo by Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY SportsYou can see where this is going. Players cover logos. Shoe companies get upset, because they're not getting the human billboard advertising they paid for. Coaches and athletic administrators freak out, because those payments help cover their plus-size salaries and comfy perks. Meanwhile, reporters want to know what's behind the biggest college sports story of the year: How come you're masking that Swoosh or that Under Armour logo?Honestly, is there a better visual metaphor for protesting the ongoing economic exploitation of big-time campus athletes?Indeed, the beauty of spatting is that it would lay bare the NCAA's biggest lies: that athletes such as Johnson are simply students who happen to be good at sports, and that major college football and basketball are just noncommercial extracurricular activities, like the campus chess club.In 1978, a NCAA member school questioned whether the wearing of a sports uniform bearing a manufacturer's logo counted as the promotion of a commercial product\u2014something that would cut against the association's self-professed values. The association proclaimed that \"as long as the logo on the [equipment or apparel] was the same logo generally available on that product available to the public, it would not be considered promotion of a commercial product.\"Now, this might be true if and when a school is buying its uniforms off the rack, but it's a huge whopper for any athletic department, such as Texas, that is being paid to outfit its athletes. Nevertheless, current NCAA bylaws still have the audacity to claim that athletes \"should be protected from exploitation by professional and commercial enterprises [and] may not benefit from the use of his or her name, likeness or image used to promote or endorse a commercial product or entity.\"Protected from exploitation? Not considered promotion? Sure. Also, down is up. Read those pesky university-shoe company contracts again, and the legal language tells a different story. For example, Nike's Texas deal states:1) The placement of its logo or marks is \"the essence of the agreement\" and \"a bargained for material benefit\";2) Such \"continued degree of manufacturer logo prominence on competition product is of the essence [the] agreement\";3) Texas \"acknowledges that a material inducement to Nike's entrance into this Agreement is to provide broad and prominent exposure for the Nike brand and particular product, models and styles.\"Similarly, Under Armour's new 15-year, $280 million contract with the University of California, Los Angeles states that \"UCLA will require all Coaches, Staff and Teams to exclusively wear and use [UA] products whenever the Teams practice, perform or play in UCLA's intercollegiate athletic program, participate in Team-related activities (including, without limitation, travel to and from competitions, and participation in media and public relations opportunities, charity events, and photograph/video shoots) or conduct or participate in exhibitions, on-campus summer camps or clinics on behalf of UCLA.\"The Adidas logos will change to Under Armour next year. The amount athletes make will stay the same. Photo by Kelvin Kuo-USA TODAY SportsIf the above doesn't describe promotion\u2014required promotion, no less\u2014I don't know what does. It's right there in writing. College athletes could and should respond in kind. Before spatting, each participating athlete should send a signed Spat Notice letter to their athletic director (and local media), stating that:\u25cf The school's shoe/apparel contract makes plain that the player is required to promote by wearing and displaying a logo;\u25cf NCAA bylaws make plain that amateurism forbids players from commercial promotion;\u25cf Player-school contracts do not require athletes to wear and display logos;\u25cf As such, the undersigned athletes intend to spat their shoes and uniforms with logos for upcoming televised games, until and unless the school meets their demands.How would schools react? In all likelihood, favorably. After all, they would be boxed in: force athletes not to spat, and they would be essentially admitting those athletes are employees with contractual commercial obligations; allow athletes to spat, and they would lose a whole lot of money. Plus, an ongoing spat protest in major college football or men's basketball\u2014at one school or a dozen\u2014could trigger a media frenzy of unflattering coverage highlighting the hypocritical absurdity of NCAA amateurism. A coach could suspend or cut spatters for \"creating a distraction\"\u2014only that would create a much bigger oneAs such, my guess is that athletes wouldn't even need to spat. They would only need to send a threatening letter to gain bargaining leverage. A backlash is always possible, but this would be far less risky than an all-out strike that could potentially anger fans who at the end of the day simply want to watch games. A spat campaign, on the other hand, could produce sympathy. Really, why shouldn't those guys get a cut of the shoe money? They're the ones wearing the shoes!What should athletes demand? Perhaps they actually want to be protected from the upside-down commercial exploitation described by NCAA bylaws, and have corporate logos removed from their uniforms. More likely, they want to protected from the NCAA's commercial exploitation, and granted workplace rights, protections, and a fairer share of the money their labor generates.Personally, I think athletes should focus on a pressing, immediate goal: obtaining top-tier, longer-tail health and disability coverage. Currently, schools typically provide coverage that is either secondary to an athlete's personal health insurance, or a primary policy that only extends one year past the date of injury. (In fact, most schools better insure their buildings and intellectual property than their human player-assets). That's simply not good enough. Asking for a Player Insurance Fund\u2014at the precise amount that could be clawed back during a spatting campaign\u2014would be a step in the right direction, and help athletes such as Johnson sleep more soundly at night. It would also be awfully hard to argue against, even by people who believe Dante should have reserved a tenth circle for college athletes with money in their pockets. Who's against health care?Of course, it ultimately would be up to players to decide what matters most to them. The important thing is that they have a terrific negotiating tool at their disposal, one with the power of a forklift. It's hanging in every college locker room, tucked away in a thousand and one campus closets. They just have to use it. Athletes of the NCAA, unite! And spat.

It was his biggest problem when I first started dealing with him in the 1980s, and it\u2019s his biggest problem now.Plenty of financial and real estate players got carried away in the go-go 1980s. But Trump was in a class by himself.He ended up presiding over six \u2014 count \u2019em, six \u2014 bankruptcies because he kept making business decisions with his gut rather than with his brain.Trump\u2019s less-than-stellar business history has been well documented by The Washington Post and other newspapers, magazines and online publications, as has his lack of self-control in his personal life. But what has not been fully explored is the impulsiveness \u2014 actually, total recklessness \u2014 that was at the root of the pivotal decisions that tanked his businesses.That same impulsiveness is at the root of Trump\u2019s self-inflicted political and business problems today.Impulse control is of only passing public concern when we\u2019re dealing with a business player, unless the player has amassed enough billions of debts or other obligations to threaten the stability of global financial markets. Trump wasn\u2019t remotely that big a hitter in the \u201980s and \u201990s, and certainly isn\u2019t now, his boasts and preening notwithstanding.But public concern about self-control is very relevant for a president of the United States. Whether we\u2019re talking about the Bay of Pigs (when John F. Kennedy resisted the hawkish instincts of his advisers who wanted to escalate) or the bugging of Democratic headquarters (which Richard Nixon could not resist) or the invasion of Iraq (need I say more?), presidents are bombarded with chances to over\u00adreact, and their over\u00adreactions can have catastrophic consequences for our country and the world.Looking back, you can see how out of control Trump was during his early days, as an heir to a family fortune built on low-profile real estate who was determined to become a star.He grabbed two casinos in Atlantic City in the 1980s because he could, using tons of borrowed money. He bought these casinos knowing that a new, bigger and glitzier casino, the Taj Mahal, was underway and would cannibalize the casinos that he was buying.So what did he do? He compounded his problems by grabbing the Taj and financing its over-the-top opulence with $675 million of junk bonds that carried a 14 percent interest rate. The Taj did, in fact, cannibalize the Trump Plaza and Trump Castle casinos, as well as their Atlantic City competitors. But although the Trump Taj Mahal drew good crowds, it couldn\u2019t begin to earn enough profit to cover its bond interest.Ultimately, the Taj and Trump\u2019s two other casinos each filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. That made Trump what bankruptcy types would call a 33. You know, three times 11.The bankruptcy of New York\u2019s Plaza Hotel, a trophy property that Trump bought at an absurdly high price with borrowed money, made him a 44. Trump boasted about the purchase in newspaper ads. But his Plaza preening didn\u2019t help the hotel pay its bills.Trump impulsively grabbed two other high-profile properties: the world\u2019s biggest yacht, which he renamed the Trump Princess; and Eastern Airlines\u2019 Boston-New York-Washington shuttle, which became the Trump Shuttle. These, too, were paid for with borrowed money, some of which Trump personally guaranteed, an act of incredible recklessness. Trump said publicly that he hadn\u2019t personally guaranteed any of his borrowings \u2014 but that was a lie, one of many that he has uttered during his business and political careers.The yacht and the shuttle were taken over by Trump\u2019s creditors and unloaded for vastly less than he paid. That was simpler and better for everyone than two more Trump bankruptcies.Because I specialize in writing about financial excesses and am used to dealing with people who engage in fantasy finance, I realized fairly early in the game that Trump\u2019s real estate and casino empire was doomed.And I figured that because he had idiotically issued personal guarantees on more than $800 million of his $3.3 billion of debt, he was headed for personal bankruptcy. Personally guaranteeing properties\u2019 debts puts everything you own at risk. Savvy, in-control developers don\u2019t do that. Reckless and desperate ones do.So on June 17, 1990, my column, \"The Party\u2019s Over for Trump,\" ran on the front page of my then-employer, the now-defunct New York Newsday newspaper. \"Trump,\" I wrote, \"is on his way down \u2014 and probably out.\"I was right about the \"down\" part but not about the \"out\" part. Much to my surprise, Trump managed to escape the financial wreckage that he created without having to declare personal bankruptcy.That\u2019s partly because he got expert advice from Stephen Bollenbach, a big-time guy whom he had the sense to hire to negotiate with his creditors. Another reason was that some of Trump\u2019s biggest creditors had their own financial problems and didn\u2019t want to engage in messy public disputes with a master media manipulator like Trump.And, to be fair, a major reason Trump didn\u2019t end up in personal bankruptcy was his own negotiating skills \u2014 which are considerable.It was an amazing recovery, and Trump deserves full credit (no pun intended) for pulling it off. He lost major properties and was put on a humiliating (for him) monthly allowance by his creditors. But he walked away from the wreckage rather than having to be carried out.Trump emerged with a majority stake in his three post-bankrupt casinos, which conferred tax advantages on the properties, and allowed them to continue using his name.In 1995, he got a bonus from his casino stake: He persuaded the investing public (talk about suckers!) to fork over $140 million for stock in a publicly traded company, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, whose ticker symbol was DJT. As in Donald John Trump.The company bearing Trump\u2019s initials bought Trump\u2019s casinos at high prices. That helped DJT the person shed financial obligations but saddled DJT the company with debt that it couldn\u2019t pay.The company went bankrupt in 2004, and its successor went broke in 2009. That made Trump one of the few \u2014 if not the only \u2014 Chapter 66 guys in public life. The company went broke for a third time in 2014, but by then, Trump had only a 10 percent stake. So he\u2019s Donald 66 Trump rather than Donald 77. Public investors in DJT stock were wiped out.After his 1990 crash, Trump stopped gambling huge amounts of borrowed money to build properties. I don\u2019t know if it was self-control, fear or an inability to borrow. In any event, it served him well.I was impressed at how Trump transformed himself from a high-wire borrowing act into a licensor: someone who gets businesses to pay him fees for the right to use his name. Getting money rolling in the door without taking risks is a very nice business.I figured Trump would do the sensible and intelligent thing \u2014 be happy as a rehabilitated, very rich person (though nowhere as rich as he claims to be), feel relieved that he had escaped total disaster and not go looking for more trouble. I thought he had learned his lesson.What I didn\u2019t realize \u2014 until The Post asked me to help with its Trump coverage when he launched his presidential campaign a year ago \u2014 is that although Trump managed not to impulsively borrow huge amounts of money to overpay for things, he was still unable, or perhaps unwilling, to rein in his impulses.Lack of impulse control has enormously benefited his presidential campaign. It distinguished him among the17 initial Republican candidates, allowed him to dominate cable TV news and got him massive coverage in other media as well. There\u2019s a lot to be said for being blunt \u2014 but Trump routinely journeys from blunt into ranting, which helped him in the Republican primaries but could pose major political and business dangers for him in the general election.I suspect that one reason he comes up short on impulse control involves his 14 seasons on \"The Apprentice.\" That\u2019s the reality TV show that General Electric\u2019s then-chief executive Jack Welch and one of his top lieutenants, Bob Wright, bestowed on Trump after he did an impressive job converting New York\u2019s financially distressed Gulf and Western Building (on which GE\u2019s pension trust held a mortgage) into the Trump International Hotel and Tower.\"The Apprentice\" was a pivotal event for Trump. It made him into a truly national figure, and he says the show paid him more than $200 million during its run.The crazier Trump acted on \"The Apprentice,\" the more he carried on and humiliated people and declared \"you\u2019re fired,\" the better TV it was. So whatever instincts he might have had to develop self-control were vitiated by \"The Apprentice.\"But there\u2019s a downside \u2014 a huge one \u2014 to his behavior, and it\u2019s starting to become apparent now. He\u2019s incredibly reckless. He seems to sometimes license his name to questionable enterprises, without doing much (if any) research into them. He makes enemies he doesn\u2019t have to make because he baits people and institutions that don\u2019t bow down to him, and he reacts badly when organizations such as The Post (which he has banned from his campaign events) challenge him by asking perfectly reasonable questions.He put his name on Trump University, which systematically victimized middle-class and lower-middle-class people, according to an investigation by the New York attorney general and an ongoing class-action suit in California.Those are the kind of people who are perceived to be his core constituency. I wonder how many middle and lower-middle types had no idea about what Trump U was up to until recently and didn\u2019t know how Trump has stiffed all sorts of contractors over the years, resulting in lots of blue-collar workers losing their jobs. I wonder whether this knowledge will erode the faith of some Trump fans.Do you think the public would be paying much attention to Trump U\u2019s travails if it weren\u2019t for Trump\u2019s political profile? Trump, of course, compounded the problem by gratuitously attacking the ethnic background of the judge who dared to rule against him.Do you think people would be clamoring to see Trump\u2019s tax returns, which presidential candidates for 40 years have disclosed, if he weren\u2019t about to become the Republican nominee? A return that Trump, in a typical switcheroo, first said he would be willing to disclose but now says he won\u2019t produce because no one cares.Well, I care, and so should you. There are at least two obvious reasons and a third reason that\u2019s not obvious to anyone but real estate types and tax techies.First, we ought to see whether Trump\u2019s income, holdings and taxes incurred (if any) are consistent with his claim of having a net worth in excess of $10 billion.Second, we ought to see his charitable contributions, which he claims are \"generous.\"The third \u2014 and not obvious \u2014 reason involves something called Section 469 of the U.S. tax code. Rental real estate, a Trump specialty, typically throws off tax losses\u00ad for its owners.But Section 469 forbids taxpayers from using these losses to offset other income unless more than half their business activities (at least 750 hours a year) involve developing or managing real estate. Not licensing their name to golf courses or making speeches\u00ad or being on TV reality shows.We ought to see if Trump has used Section 469 to shelter income in past years. And especially last year, when he was running for president.Trump could clear all of this up in a heartbeat by voluntarily releasing his tax returns. Doing so would minimize what is likely to be considerable damage if his tax returns somehow get leaked. But that would require Trump to control his impulses and reverse his position, something he rarely does.Trump had been presenting himself as a really generous guy. But his self-proclaimed image as a generous donor to worthy causes has been shredded by groundbreaking articles that my Post colleagues have written.None of this would be happening to Trump if he had just kept his mouth largely shut and his head down instead of trying to become president by spewing falsehoods and insults, exposing himself to all sorts of risks he didn\u2019t have to take.One needless risk that he\u2019s taken involves praising the late, unlamented Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein for supposedly keeping terrorism in check. But now that Trump has brought Hussein into the campaign, I\u2019m struck by similarities between them: Both made remarkable comebacks, and both have (or in Hussein\u2019s case, had) impulse control problems.Hussein amazingly managed to remain in power despite losing the 1991 Gulf War to the United States and its allies, who threw him out of Kuwait and inflicted immense losses on his military. It looked like Hussein was absolutely finished. But he emerged from the Gulf War in control of Iraq, managed to slaughter his internal opponents and ended up presiding over a country that had the world\u2019s fourth-largest army.But instead of being satisfied with that, Hussein couldn\u2019t resisting trying to be a major player on the world scene. So he led people to believe that he was developing weapons of mass destruction.The WMDs didn\u2019t exist, as we now know \u2014 but lots of people thought they did. That led to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and the destruction of Hussein.No, I\u2019m not accusing Trump of being a dictator wannabe. Just pointing out the striking similarities.Trump is going to pay a serious price in image and money if he doesn\u2019t win the presidency \u2014 and maybe even if he does.His various rants have cost him sponsorships, led some organizations to shun his enterprises and have focused attention on things such as the Trump University litigation that hadn\u2019t previously attracted mass attention.In addition, his campaign has prompted numerous organizations and people to tell the true story of Trump as a businessman, and how he\u2019s made up numbers and spewed exaggerations, lies and nonsense. That\u2019s totally at odds with the way Trump has portrayed himself for decades.Until a year ago, Trump\u2019s lack of impulse control was amusing (except to some of his targets) but didn\u2019t really matter to the country at large. Now, with him having a significant chance to become the leader of the world\u2019s foremost country, it matters a lot.Maybe Trump can learn to control his impulses \u2014 but there\u2019s no sign that he has. And, unfortunately, there\u2019s no sign that he will.End of story.", "answers": {"answer_start": [104], "text": ["lack of impulse control"]}, "id": "4tf0s2"}, {"question": "This is the age of the average midlife crisis, according to big data", "context": "A still from the 1984 music video \"Forever Young.\" RIP 1984. (YouTube)Midlife crises are tricky things to measure. I mean, you can\u2019t exactly vacuum up all the data on 50-year-old men buying Camaros or middle-aged moms dropping in for Botox.But Spotify, the streaming music juggernaut, can track the music that people listen to at every age \u2014 a pretty solid indicator of their cultural tastes. And in a new analysis of that data, Spotify found that there\u2019s a specific point when middle-aged listeners drop their sophisticated singer-songwriters, their \"best of the 80s, 90s and today,\" and spontaneously start listening to teeny-bopper pop again.That age is \u2014 drumroll, please \u2014 42.(Forty-somethings in the audience: This one goes out to you.)Admittedly, the exact age of the average midlife crisis isn\u2019t exactly mind-blowing research. But there\u2019s more where that came from: By analyzing user data, Spotify has also nailed down the listening patterns people adopt over their lifetimes.Listeners become less interested in popular music over time \u2014 until that little dip, circa age 42. (Spotify)Young adults and 20-somethings, for instance, tend to stick to what\u2019s on the top charts: your T Swifts, your Wiz Khalifas. During their 20s, however, most people \u2014 particularly men \u2014 start listening to less and less mainstream music as they explore artists and genres outside FM radio and as they return to the artists they liked growing up. By 35, most adults have stopped keeping up with whatever the hot new thing on MTV is.But at 42, there\u2019s a sharp regression: a return to pop music that doesn\u2019t quite dissipate until the mid-40s. And it can\u2019t be blamed on parents listening to their kids\u2019 music, either \u2014 parents actually never have that little backwards-looking interest in pop music.This is all a very good reminder not only that the Cool Dad archetype has some basis in reality, but also that Spotify is less a music company than a data one: Like all of the other major music-streaming platforms, its future lies in its ability to measure and predict your tastes better than anyone else.To that end, Spotify acquired the \"music intelligence\" service Echo Nest in March of last year \u2014 this latest research was actually conducted by a former Echo Nest-er. Spotify can now pinpoint, among many, many other things, the exact sections of songs that listeners like most, the differing schedules of fans in New York and Laredo, and the exact songs a 55-year-old will want on his running playlist, versus a 25-year-old.Spotify is far from the only company vying for data dominance here: Pandora employs a team of more than 80 curators, analysts and scientists solely for the purpose of perfecting personalization; Songza, which Google acquired last year, mines everything from the user\u2019s location to the current weather when recommending playlists. (Wrote the Guardian\u2019s Stuart Dredge last July: \"Never underestimate the importance of data in a Google acquisition.\")With all this research and data, perhaps the big question is: Why isn\u2019t music personalization, well \u2014 any more accurate? You\u2019d think that, if Spotify can predict what jazz tracks a 13-year-old girl will like most, they could also figure out that I never, under any circumstance, want to hear Jason Derulo.It turns out that, for now, at least, algorithms can\u2019t perfectly replicate the whims and weirdnesses of human taste.

After all, they want to prove that they are smart and talented enough to handle your business.But in fact warmth, or trustworthiness, is the most important factor in how people evaluate you. \"From an evolutionary perspective,\" Cuddy says, \"it is more crucial to our survival to know whether a person deserves our trust.\" It makes sense when you consider that in cavemen days it was more important to figure out if your fellow man was going to murder you and steal all your possessions than if he was competent enough to build a good fire.Amazon Cuddy\u2019s new book explores how to feel more confident.While competence is highly valued, Cuddy says it is evaluated only after trust is established.

The complaint alleges that the Baltimore university failed to keep students safe, and specifically that it knew police were investigating a reported gang rape at a fraternity that continued to throw parties, but did not inform the campus community.JHU spokesman Dennis O'Shea confirmed to HuffPost the university had received notice of the investigation in a letter dated Friday, Aug. 8. JHU President Ronald J. Daniels disclosed the investigation in a campus-wide message Tuesday.\"Nothing remains more important to Johns Hopkins than the welfare of our students, and although the OCR notification does not contain any specific details about the underlying allegations, we will continue to take strong action to improve and to lead in this evolving area of the law and practice,\" Daniels said.The opening of an investigation does not imply the department believes the university has, in fact, violated the law.According to the Title IX complaint, a student identified as Jane Doe accused a university dean of dissuading her from formally reporting her rape by telling her that no student had ever been expelled over sexual assault.JHU is officially being investigated on whether it \"discriminates on the basis of sex by failing to promptly and equitably respond to complaints of sexual assault and violence,\" an Education Department official said on background.News of the complaint this spring sparked student protests on campus and a review of the university's policies in such cases. However, sexual violence on campus has been a long-standing source of discontent among students, even as the White House has praised the school for being among those that would, according to some headlines, \"lead the way\" in addressing the issue.Daniels noted in his email to the university that an ongoing Sexual Violence Advisory Committee of students, faculty and administrators is working on ways the university can improve its response, and the university this summer launched a new website on sexual assault.The Education Department has yet to open an investigation in response to a separate but related Clery complaint, also filed this year in February. Violations of the Clery Act can lead to a maximum $35,000 fine per violation.

Photo credit: Bloomberg.Lego, the maker of the plastic toys you probably played with as a kid, has been named the most powerful brand in the world. Every year consulting firm Brand Finance releases a list of the strongest brands, and Lego took the top spot for 2017.Brand Finance's most powerful brands ranking is calculated based on three criteria. The first is equity through surveys, consumers answer questions like which brands they prefer and intend to purchase. Brand Finance rolls these responses up into an equity metric and assigns it 50% of the brand power score. The second dimension, brand input, measures how much money brands spend on marketing. The more you spend, the higher you rank. The last piece, output, looks at a company's profit margins and prices. A brand with a high margin that commands a premium price in its category scores well in this third area. Each of these last two dimensions make up 25% of the brand power score. To view the 10 most powerful brands in 2017, open the gallery below. Lego has long had the foundation of a strong brand. According to the report Brand Finance released this month,  appeal spans generations; as well as the creative freedom it gives children, the brand appeals to the nostalgia of adults. Lego has also avoided gendered marketing, giving it a broad customer base. In 2015, after The Lego Movie had achieved commercial and critical success, Lego topped Brand Finance's powerful brands list. It was displaced for a year by Disney, but has since regained the number-one spot. Last week Lego released a sequel to The Lego Movie, and its box-office sales beat every other movie showing in America. Brand Finance expects this film to further boost Lego's brand. Google was named the second most powerful brand. It remains the far-and-away category leader in its core search business. This year Google also became the world's most valuable brand, bumping Apple to second place. Brand Finance estimates Google's total brand value at $109 billion. Visa ranked fifth.

I'm calling BULLSHIT on \"secret\" and \"surprise\" weddings. I don't mean you can't have elements of surprise for your future spouse (today's groom surprised the birthday bride with cheesecake cupcakes at their pig roast), but I'm saying that deciding to plan an entire, secretive destination wedding with a huge group of people and then planning to pop the question en route or when your bride-to-be is already trapped down here is NOT A GOOD IDEA. I am telling you this from experience. I have now officially planned more than one \"secret wedding\" and I'm still suffering PTSD from the experience. So is my staff.Oh sure, it started out innocently enough. I got a call from a guy who wanted to \"surprise\" his girlfriend with a wedding in Vieques. Not an elopement, mind you -- a full-blown wedding with caterers, tents, lights, first dances, photographers, etc. And he wanted me to plan all of it -- with very little direction from him -- so that it was all ready to go when everybody arrived. The first few months went fairly smoothly as he approved the venues I found him and made those arrangements. Enter the \"helpful\" friend.A \"good friend\" of the bride's (not the MoH, mind you) had volunteered to help with the planning. Oh dear. Suddenly the whole picture changed. I had to do twice as much work because I had to get her to approve everything and then she had to have him approve everything and then she had to come back to me with changes. Extensive changes every time. If you're not giving me much to go on, you can't expect me to get it right on the first try. But try I did.Despite the challenges, we were ready to go when the group began arriving. The bride accepted the groom's proposal on another tropical island the night before he flew her to Vieques for her wedding. At that point, I felt better meeting the actual bride and talking through the little details with her. Still, the \"helpful friend\" was aggressive and didn't want me to tell the bride her colors or other pertinent information. The groom wouldn't let her have a say in their processional song (about the only thing left to choose). They hadn't even brought her appropriate dress options to wear and she ended up shopping in my boutique for a sundress last minute. Even after seeing that, I thought we were really good to go at that point.Turns out, not everybody who travelled to be there for \"secret wedding\" was actually a fan of the nuptials occurring. And when we (the wedding planning staff that the disgruntled family members always latch onto for venting purposes) found out that half of the guests weren't real excited about the wedding, things just got weird. The \"happy\" side partied harder, and the unhappy side got quieter and quieter. I'm not sure we've ever done a teardown so fast. Don't get me wrong -- they all had fun (the happy ones, including the bride and groom) at the wedding and I hope that the lucky couple is together and happy for years to come. But I had no idea what we were walking into that weekend. I've had family members and guests to contend with who weren't happy about the union before, but never in such an incredibly weird situation. I kept wondering if I had unwittingly forced this woman into matrimony by being a part of the groom's team? Seriously a conundrum, but we did our jobs. I won't be in the situation again.We got a call from a groom the other day who wants to surprise his bride with their entire family at the elopement she has so meticulously planned in a coming month. I'd never heard his voice before his secret call to me. He's had nothing to do with any of the planning -- she's coordinated it all. And everything is going to be all screwed up with six new surprise guests (minimum) descending on her wedding and honeymoon. I'm not saying she might not be thrilled. I don't know her that well. But I got the definite impression in planning with her that they were coming all the way to Vieques because she wanted it to be just about the two of them. I CAN'T tell her. If it's a happy surprise, I'll ruin it. If she's pissed, let's just hope she gets mad at her fiance\u0301 and not the innocent wedding planner.I like surprises. Sometimes. I think everybody is a little different. But this is something that I do know -- most women have some vision of their wedding day in their heads... and if you arbitrarily take it away from them -- even with the best of intentions -- I'm not sure that's the best foot to start out a marriage on. Also, most women want some say in what they wear to get married. Again, there are exceptions... but you take a heck of a risk when you drag somebody to a remote tropical island to get married without a wedding gown.So I did yet another \"secret wedding\" consult with yet another groom this week -- he wants to do much the same as the other guy did except he wants to actually plan it with me, not pass me off to a friend of a friend to deal with. It's not that I don't believe him when he says she's going to be thrilled, and it's not that I don't think we can pull off the surprise -- we've done it before! I just wonder if, as a woman and fellow human being, maybe I'm not supposed to help \"surprise\" any bride with a pop-up wedding.

The hooks are plastic and have a small hole in the base where the camera is located.

And with the devastating toll associated with an increase in storms, heat and drought that have only intensified, much of the talk nowadays has shifted to interventions that can lessen the impact.In Scandinavia, the situation has already moved way beyond being a topic of serious discussion. Since 2012, officials and planners in Copenhagen have been knee-deep in an effort to turn the neighborhood of St. Kjeld into one of the most well-equipped places on earth.The inspiration came from a hard-learned lesson from a few years back. Wedged between the North and Baltic Sea, Copenhagen\u2019s coastal location has made it at times susceptible to cloudbursts, a kind of heavy rainfall that moves in suddenly. When this happens, it can occur in just a matter of hours. One such occurrence in 2011 left some parts of the city submerged in as much as 20 inches of rain and forced widespread evacuations. In all, it cost the city over $1 billion in damages.\"Whereas a place like New York has to worry about rising sea levels, our flood risk comes from major rainstorms,\" says Flemming Rafn Thomsen, a partner at Tredje Natur who\u2019s tasked with preparing parts of the city for what\u2019s expected to be tougher times ahead.Previously, the city had looked at funding a series of proposed upgrades to the sewage system and concluded that an urban renewal style makeover would not only be just as effective, but also cost less. On Dec. 6, St. Kjeld was officially inaugurated as Klimakvarteret, Danish for the Climate Quarter. Below is a glimpse of the kinds of transformation currently taking place.Copenhagen\u2019s St. Kjeld neighborhood (top) is in the midst of being adapted to better cope with the consequences of global warming (bottom).The core principle behind climate-adapted urban renewal is to counter nature\u2019s onslaught by reintroducing more nature \u2014 fighting fire with fire, if you will. Pavement, for instance, stores a lot of heat so swapping out asphalt with trees helps to offset what\u2019s known as the heat island effect. Trees also provide shade, humidify the air and lower the surrounding temperature to create what Thomsen describes as a protective micro-climate.Besides trees, walkways are being populated with pockets of soil, grass and other kinds of lawn vegetation. While a sudden downpour can easily overwhelm sewers, computer simulations showed that dirt and ground plants are able to filter pollutants and absorb significant amounts of water to minimize the runoff and assist in the sanitation process.Along the main square, sidewalks and other pedestrian spaces will be raised to form slopes and winding walkways as a way of diverting rainwater onto the streets and toward the harbor. Roadways will also run lower while entrances to basements are positioned higher to prevent water from seeping into homes and buildings. The trick, Thomsen says, is to integrate all these safeguards in a manner that\u2019s so aesthetically pleasing, nobody would notice their primary function.During periods of sweltering heat, residents and visitors can find some relief underneath a large \"artificial cloud\" ring that gently sprays a continuous cooling mist throughout the day.Looking ahead, city officials and planners have mapped out the areas of St. Kjeld where similar landscaping techniques can be applied to form a cohesive self-sustaining system. The project is slated for completion by 2017 with total costs estimated to be in the ballpark of $7 million.Thomsen says his firm has proposed to apply the principle of \"greening\" urban spaces to adjoining buildings as well. Besides possibly having a pivotal role in neutralizing climate-induced threats, the approach comes with other notable benefits, such as cleaner, more breathable air and lower levels of stress.Another project Thomsen\u2019s group has in the works is the redevelopment of Enghaveparken, a park located a little bit south of St. Kjeld. The plan, he says, is to erect barriers that double as seats around the central recreation area. In the rare instance where a monster storm passes through, the park would function as a temporary reservoir, collecting as much as eight million gallons that would later drain out safely at a more gradual rate.", "answers": {"answer_start": [493], "text": ["Copenhagen"]}, "id": "565031386000945152"}, {"question": "This kind of sugar triggers unhealthy cravings", "context": "A new study shows a type of sugar found naturally in fruit may increase cravings for high-calorie foods.In a small study of 24 people published in the journal PNAS , researchers found that fructose \u2014 which we primarily consume as an added sweetener in processed foods \u2014 was associated with activity in some areas of the brain that process rewards.MORE: This Is the No. 1 Driver of Diabetes and ObesityThe researchers gave the volunteers cherry-flavored drinks that were sweetened with fructose on one day and drinks sweetened with glucose on another day, and asked them to report their hunger levels.Neuroimaging scans of the participants showed more activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and visual cortex of their brains, which are involved in reward processing, when they looked at images of food after they ingested fructose compared to glucose.The researchers also showed the men and women images of high calorie foods and asked if they would like to have food now, or if they would like a monetary bonus later on. When drinking fructose, the individuals were more likely to say they wanted the food reward right away rather than money later on.\"These findings suggest that ingestion of fructose relative to glucose results in greater activation of brain regions involved in attention and reward processing and may promote feeding behavior,\" the study authors write. It's possible, they suggest, that fructose has less appetite suppressing effects compared to glucose. As TIME has previously reported , the two types of sugar are metabolized differently in the body.The findings are still preliminary and the study sample was small, but this isn't the first time that fructose has been linked to possibly unhealthy effects.

Then she entrusted her career to USA Swimming", "context": "PHOENIX \u2014 This was supposed to be the year Dagny Knutson became a household name by thrashing the competition in the pool in Rio de Janeiro.In 2010, Knutson was widely considered the next breakout American swimming star. At the urging of USA Swimming officials, she said, Knutson turned down a college scholarship and entrusted her career to the Olympic national governing body for the sport.And then it all went awry.In six years, Knutson has gone from odds-on Olympic star to cautionary tale through a series of twists and turns including a fired coach, an eating disorder and an unresolved fraud lawsuit against an Olympic sports insider who Knutson claims betrayed her to maintain friendships with USA Swimming officials.Knutson\u2019s story, according to her and her lawyers, evinces the massive power imbalance in Olympic sports, where management enjoys monopoly control and athletes have little leverage.\"As athletes, we have to trust USA Swimming has our best interests at heart. And when they take advantage of that, we can\u2019t do anything about it . . . Because they have all the power,\" Knutson said. \"I can\u2019t think of any other explanation for why they did what they did, other than they don\u2019t care.\"USA Swimming declined to comment for this story. In a deposition, USA Swimming Executive Director Chuck Wielgus blamed Knutson\u2019s situation on a former coach who made promises he wasn\u2019t authorized to make.\"USA Swimming likes to do the right thing. We hang our hat on that,\" Wielgus said.Today, Knutson is a 24-year-old counselor for college students in Phoenix, living in a one-bedroom apartment with no trace of her former life as a world-class swimmer. The medals and Team USA garb are packed in boxes in her mother\u2019s North Dakota home.\"She was just a thoroughbred that they wanted to put out to pasture, or get rid of,\" said her mother, Ronda Knutson. \"I\u2019m just sickened by it.\"Born in 1992, Knutson grew up in Minot, N.D., a town of about 35,000 where neighbors leave garage doors open and front doors unlocked. Inspired by watching the 2000 Sydney Olympics with her father, Knutson started swimming competitively at age 9.When she was 12, Knutson set four state records, earning a mention in Sports Illustrated. When she was 16, Knutson broke the American record in the 400-yard individual medley and won six gold medals at a junior international swimming event, posting times that would have made her competitive at the Beijing Olympics the previous year.Her performances brought visits from USA Swimming officials to northern North Dakota, a region not known for producing elite swimmers. The only Olympic-size pool in the area was outdoors and lacked lights. Jim Knutson, an Army veteran and nurse, struck a deal for Dagny to swim there at night in the summer. Jim provided the lights by parking his Jeep near the pool.\"It\u2019s just so different than the typical path,\" Mark Schubert, the venerated, longtime Olympic swimming coach, told The Washington Post in 2009 about Knutson. \"It kind of gives everybody hope.\"In early 2010, Schubert flew to Minot with a proposition for Knutson and her parents. Knutson had accepted a full athletic scholarship from Auburn University, but had just learned the coach who recruited her was leaving. Dozens of other colleges were interested in her, but Schubert recommended another option, according to Knutson: She could turn professional and train at one of USA Swimming\u2019s \"Centers of Excellence,\" training facilities Schubert developed.Knutson would get more individualized attention, Schubert told her, and USA Swimming would offer the equivalent of a full scholarship, covering her tuition, room and living costs through the 2016 Olympics.Her parents had doubts, but after Dagny visited the Center for Excellence in Fullerton, Calif., she was convinced. She moved there in the summer of 2010 and enrolled in community college. The Knutsons never asked Schubert to put the offer in writing, a decision they would later regret.\"I don\u2019t know if you want to call us naive or what, but we just had no reason to believe they wouldn\u2019t do this,\" Ronda Knutson said.In November 2010, USA Swimming abruptly fired Schubert. No reason was given publicly, but Schubert and Wielgus\u2019s relationship reportedly had soured.With Schubert gone, Knutson reached out to USA Swimming officials about her rent and tuition. It quickly became apparent they had no idea what Schubert had promised her.Headquartered in Colorado Springs, USA Swimming oversees nearly every level of the sport domestically and manages Team USA at the Olympics and other international events. In 2010, USA Swimming reported $26.4 million in revenue and paid Wielgus $781,000 and Schubert $368,000.Team USA swimmers, though, made stipends of $1,750 per month. Almost immediately, court records show, Wielgus expressed concern about the cost of the deal Knutson said she\u2019d been promised.On Nov. 11, 2010, Wielgus emailed several other USA Swimming officials. \"Mark apparently made promises . . . to Dagny that: (a) he did not make me or others aware of; and (b) he did not have the authority to make,\" he wrote.Schubert denied guaranteeing Knutson tuition support after the 2012 Olympics, but both Knutson\u2019s parents and two other witnesses to the meeting supported Dagny\u2019s claims.Knutson\u2019s agent connected her with Richard Foster, a lawyer well-known in Olympic circles. Foster has never won a medal or made an Olympic team, but he\u2019s one of many members of the \"Olympic movement\" who has parlayed his relationships into income over the years.A collegiate water polo player, Foster has served in various capacities for USA Water Polo, the United States Olympic Committee, and FINA, the global organization that oversees international swimming. He wrote a book for Olympic legend Mark Spitz, secured a consulting position with a pool manufacturer and gained clients including several Olympic swimmers and Schubert, the famed coach.From the beginning of his negotiations on Knutson\u2019s behalf, records show, Foster made clear to USA Swimming officials they did not need to worry about a lawsuit from Knutson.\"Chuck: As you know, I represent a lot of athletes, including a fairly large group of swimmers,\" Foster wrote Wielgus on Nov. 16, 2010. \"If an issue comes up, I will discuss it with you in hopes of resolving the issue. I won\u2019t however get involved with litigation against USA Swimming. I have too many friends in the organization, including you.\"The next day, Foster emailed Wielgus to let him know an Associated Press reporter had contacted him. Word of Knutson\u2019s situation had started to circulate. \"I told the reporter I couldn\u2019t comment,\" Foster wrote.After months of negotiations, Foster emailed Knutson what he termed the \"final offer\": USA Swimming would cover Knutson\u2019s college costs through 2016, but only if she maintained a spot in either the top 25 of the world or top three in the United States in one Olympic event.Before signing, Knutson balked at the performance requirement. She didn\u2019t like the idea that if she had a bad year, or got hurt, she\u2019d lose her college money.As her lawyer, Foster replied, \"A performance marker is not unreasonable.\" A few days later, he sent over the contract. \"Dagny: We wanted to get a little more up front, but this is a good deal,\" he wrote. She signed it.At first, things went well. Knutson moved to Gainesville, Fla., attended community college and trained under University of Florida Coach Gregg Troy. In 2011, she won a gold medal at the FINA World Championships as part of the 800-meter freestyle relay team that included Missy Franklin.In 2012, a private struggle Knutson had been dealing with burst into public view. She had an eating disorder \u2014 bulimia \u2014 marked by periods of binging followed by purging, or making herself throw up. Studies have shown eating disorder rates are higher among athletes, particularly women, than the general population.While Franklin won four gold medals at the London Olympics, Knutson cycled through inpatient and outpatient therapy. By the fall of 2012, her condition stabilized, Knutson asked USA Swimming to start her tuition assistance at a college in North Dakota, closer to home.Lindsay Mintenko, USA Swimming\u2019s national team director, told Knutson her tuition support was over, because she\u2019d fallen from the world rankings while in treatment.Without financial assistance, Knutson\u2019s parents struggled to pay tuition and her travel and training costs as she tried to regain a national team spot . Knutson petitioned the NCAA to restore her amateur status, so she could get another scholarship, but her appeal was denied. She eventually retired from competitive swimming.In 2014, a friend connected Knutson with Bob Allard, a San Jose attorney well-known in Olympic circles for his outspoken criticism of USA Swimming for how it\u2019s handled sex-abuse prevention.Allard felt that Knutson had viable fraud lawsuits against USA Swimming and Schubert, but as part of the deal Foster negotiated, Knutson had agreed not to sue either.There was one person she could still sue, though: Foster.\"Until I hired Bob, I knew I had gotten screwed over, but I didn\u2019t know how,\" Knutson said. \"I thought it was all my fault.\"Last June, as Knutson\u2019s former teammates and other Olympic hopefuls prepared for U.S. trials, Knutson sat in a California courtroom, looking on as Allard made his opening argument.\"This is a case about a well-connected lawyer in the aquatics industry who takes on, as a client, a young and vulnerable potential Olympic champion, but places her interests well behind those of his friends, his political allies and his business associates,\" Allard told the jury. \"That\u2019s what this case is all about: a lawyer selling out his client.\"Foster pointed out the deal he got Knutson was the most lucrative USA Swimming had ever given a swimmer. When asked about his email assuring Wielgus he would never sue, Foster said his friendships help him and his clients.\"I can achieve good results negotiating with USA Swimming or any sport because of my involvement in the Olympic movement . . . They will take my calls,\" Foster testified. \"My personal relationship with them allows me access and to negotiate those deals. So if I file a lawsuit against them, I think that access is going to be gone.\"When asked why he didn\u2019t comment to the AP reporter or ask the Knutsons if they wanted to take their story public, Foster explained that \"throwing Mr. Wielgus under the bus with the press . . . could have resulted in a very dangerous outcome for Dagny.\"Allard hired a malpractice law expert, Alison Buchanan, who concluded Foster violated ethical guidelines by not listing to Knutson all his conflicts of interest in writing. Foster also violated his duty to be a \"zealous advocate\" for Knutson, Buchanan testified.\"He wasn\u2019t really working within her best interest,\" Buchanan said. \"I didn\u2019t see any communications between Mr. Foster and USA Swimming where he took a hard stance or threatened litigation. Instead he said, \u2018I would never sue you\u2019 . . . That, to me, is the opposite of zealous advocacy.\"The jurors found Foster committed a breach of fiduciary duty and fraud, and they awarded Knutson $617,800. In October, however, the judge threw out the verdict and ordered a new trial. The judge ruled that Knutson failed to prove a different lawyer could have gotten her a better deal. Allard is appealing.In a recent phone interview, Foster said Knutson\u2019s anger at him is misguided.\"I worked for her, for free, out of the goodness of my heart,\" Foster said. \"She\u2019d been treated badly by USA Swimming. And I got her a good deal.\"In Olympic sports, Foster pointed out, national governing bodies rarely pay athletes much, and multiyear contracts are almost nonexistent.\"USA Swimming would not back down. They said, \u2018We\u2019re putting up a lot of money for an athlete that hasn\u2019t even medaled yet,\u2019 \" Foster said. \"Those performance markers for her were not unreasonable . . . She was one of the best swimmers in the world.\"In April, Knutson graduated from Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, with a degree in sports management. She works at the school as a counselor, helping students apply for financial aid and pick majors.On weekends, she volunteers as a coach for the new swim team at a small Christian college nearby. It\u2019s a small team of mostly novice swimmers, and Knutson thinks they don\u2019t know her background. She doesn\u2019t swim anymore; she prefers running.\"It feels like another human swam. It doesn\u2019t feel like it was me. I used to have this self-confidence and this pride . . . I felt unstoppable,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t feel that way anymore.\"During the Olympics this summer, Knutson was busy at work, so she missed most of it. She kept track online, to see how her former teammates fared.One night, she watched highlights on her phone as she walked to her car after a long day at the office. In Rio that day, 23-year-old Maya DiRado won an upset gold medal in the 200 backstroke. DiRado also silvered in two of Knutson\u2019s old events, the 200 and 400 individual medley. Knutson was thrilled for DiRado, her former teammate from the junior national team.As Knutson drove home that night, she wept.", "answers": {"answer_start": [43], "text": ["Dagny Knutson"]}, "id": "814854515342114816"}, {"question": "Cop Who Shot Young Minority Male Sends Kaepernick Item He\u2019ll Never Forget", "context": "Retired police officer Chris Amos, a father of three, had the spotlight shone on him while he was still in uniform.

See the full letter below:An Open Letter to Colin Kaepernick,Dear Colin guess you have been pretty busy these last few days. For the record I don\u2019t think any more or less of you for not standing for the national anthem. Honestly, I never thought that much about you, or any professional athlete for that matter, to begin with. I\u2019ve read your statement a few times and want you to know I am one of the reasons you are protesting. You see I am a retired police officer that had the misfortune of having to shoot and kill a 19-year-old African-American male. And just like you said, I was the recipient of about $3,000 a month while on leave, which was a good thing because I had to support a wife and three children under 7 years old for about 2 months with that money. Things were pretty tight because I couldn\u2019t work part-time. Every police officer I\u2019ve ever known has worked part-time to help make ends meet.You know, Colin, the more I think about it, the more we seem to have in common. I really pushed myself in rehab to get back on the street, kind of like you do to get back on the field. You probably have had a broken bone or two and some muscle strains and deep bruising that needed a lot of work. I just had to bounce back from a gunshot wound to the chest and thigh. Good thing we both get paid when we are too banged up to \"play,\" huh? We both also know what it\u2019s like to get blindsided. You by a 280-pound defensive end, ouch! Me, by a couple of rounds fired from a gun about 2 feet away into my chest and thigh. We also both make our living wearing uniforms, right? You have probably ruined a jersey or two on the field of play. I still have my blood-stained shirt that my partner and paramedics literally ripped off my back that cold night in January. Fortunately, like you I was given a new one. Speaking of paramedics aren\u2019t you glad the second we get hurt trainers and doctors are standing by waiting to rush onto the field to scoop us up. I\u2019m thankful they get to you in seconds. It only took them about 10 minutes to get to me. By the grace of God, the artery in my thigh didn\u2019t rupture or else 10 minutes would have been about 9 minutes too late. We also have both experienced the hate and disgust others have just because of those uniforms we wear. I sure am glad for your sake that the folks who wear my uniform are on hand to escort you and those folks that wear your uniform into stadiums in places like Seattle!I guess that\u2019s where the similarities end, Colin. You entertain for a living, I and almost 800,000 others across this country serve and protect. Are there some bad apples within my profession? Absolutely, and they need to be identified and fired or arrested! But you know what, the vast majority do the right thing, the right way, for the right reason. Did I mention that seconds before I was shot, an elderly African-American gentleman walking down the sidewalk, turned to my partner and I as we rode past and said, \"Get them.\" Get who, you ask? The thugs terrorizing an otherwise good and decent neighborhood, home to dozens of good, decent African-American families trying to raise those families in communities not protected by gates and security guards. No these folks and families depend on America\u2019s law enforcement officers.Colin, I have buried 7 friends killed in the line of duty and three others who have committed suicide. I have attended more funerals than I care to remember of neighboring departments who have lost officers in the line of duty, during my career. Law enforcement officers with different backgrounds, upbringings and experiences united by their willingness to answer the call to protect and serve their fellow citizens.Colin, I am sorry for the endorsement deals you may lose and the dip in jersey sales, but please know you will NEVER lose what these men and women and their families have lost. And so whether you stand or sit during the national anthem means very little to me. As for me and the men and women on whose team I was privileged to serve, we will put on our ballistic vests, badge and gun, kiss our loved ones goodbye, for some tragically for the last time, and out into a shift of uncertainty we will go.

But according to new research, the calming scent can also make us more trusting of others.\"Our results might have various serious implications for a broad range of situations in which interpersonal trust is an essential element,\" Leiden psychologist Roberta Sellaro said in a statement. \"Smelling the aroma of lavender may help a seller to establish more easily a trusting negotiation to sell a car, or in a grocery store it may induce consumers to spend more money buying products. The smell of lavender may also be helpful in sport psychology to enhance trust and build team spirit, for example in the case of team games such as soccer and volleyball.\"To investigate the flower's effect on trust, Leiden University researchers exposed one group of study participants to the scent of lavender and another group to peppermint. Then, the participants were asked to play a game that is commonly used in experimental settings to measure how much one subject trusts another. In the game, a \"trustor\" was given 5 Euros and instructed to decide how much of that money to give a \"trustee\" in each round. The trustee, in return, could decide to split the money with the trustor. If the trustee gave the trustor enough money in return, he or she would receive additional money.After being exposed to lavender, participants gave significantly more money to the trustee (3.9 Euro) than those who had been exposed to peppermint (3.23 Euro). The findings \"reinforce the idea that interpersonal trust is sensitive to situational and environmental factors,\" the researchers note.Previous research on aromatherapy has found that lavender can affect mood and well-being. Lavender essential oil produces a mild calming and sedative affect, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center, and has been used to ease anxiety, depression, insomnia and fatigue.

But for one particularly tenacious pet tortoise, that hardy sense of survival allowed it to endure for decades in the most unnatural of places.Back in 1982, the Almeida Family was saddened to learn that their beloved pet, Manuela, a young red-footed tortoise, had gone missing. Their house was under renovation at the time, so the family just assumed that the slow-moving animal had slipped out through a gate left open by the construction crew -- disappearing into the forest near their home in Realengo, Brazil. But they couldn't have been more wrong.The true fate of their lost pet remained a mystery for the next 30 years, that is, until recently.Earlier last month, after their father Leonel passed away, the Almeida children returned to help clean out his cluttered storage room upstairs. As it turns out, Leonel was somewhat of a hoarder, so the room was jam-packed with things that he had found on the street, like broken televisions and furniture. Deciding it was mostly junk, the family set about moving it to the trash out front.But while son Leandro Almeida was making a trip to the dumpster with a box of broken records, a neighbor asked him if he was intending to throw out the tortoise that was holed up inside.\"At that moment I was white and did not believe,\" Leandro told Globo TV.Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0That's when the Almeidas learned that, amazingly, the hardy turtle had managed to survive three decades in storage.The family suspects she had been able to sustain herself grubbing on termites which, thanks to all that unwanted furniture, were likely in abundance. And although she seemed to be surviving just fine in the dank confines of the storage room, Manuela is no doubt pleased (in her own tortoisey way) to be reunited with the family that had so long thought her gone forever.But in the end, it's hard not to be impressed with the resiliency of life and the slow-and-steady approach to survival taken by tortoises -- both in living with us, and perhaps sometimes in spite of it.Please note, the photos show a red-footed tortoise, though not the actual one from the story, as that image was not available to us.Via Globo", "answers": {"answer_start": [1605], "text": ["in storage"]}, "id": "53u1d0"}, {"question": "@OfficialAdele is rumored for a MAJOR movie role", "context": "Adele may be on her way to the big screen.The Grammy award-winning singer, who has yet to appear in a feature film, is rumored for the starring role in an upcoming biopic about late singer Dusty Springfield.

Over the years we have interviewed thousands of successfully married couples, and most report a reasonable degree of satisfaction with their sex life. But here is our most important research finding concerning this issue: no marriage was ever made successful because the couple had a great sex life!And more importantly, when we asked successfully married couples how important sex is to the success of their marriage \u2014 to rank on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the highest \u2014 the average rank was only 6! This finding has held true over the more than 30 years of our research. The results are hardly a resounding endorsement for the importance of sex in a successful marriage.You see, marriage is a multi-faceted and highly complex relationship, and in the best marriages, no one aspect stands out as the \"make or break\" part of it. The truth is, there are seven pervasive characteristics present in all successful marriages. And guess what: sex isn't one of them! Sex is only one part of the seven characteristics of a successful marriage.As we say so often in our many interviews and writings, all of the married couples, representing the best marriages we've interviewed, have shared with us the importance of touching in their relationship. One gentleman we interviewed told us that if he passed his wife in the house a hundred times a day, he touched her. To touch someone you love is to acknowledge their presence and to communicate your desire for them. That's why the most successfully married couples amongst us do it so often.We believe that the overemphasis of sex on television, in the media, and in books about marriage cause people to believe that if they don't have stupendous sex everyday, there is something wrong with their marriage. But marriages that fail do so for a variety of reasons, not for a single reason. Simply put, our research findings hold true that no marriage was ever saved, or made successful because the couple had a great sex life.We've reported many first-hand accounts from successfully married couples who tell us how important the human touch is to a loving marriage. They hug each other often, they kiss, they touch each other while talking, they sit cheek to cheek on the couch while having a conversation, they curl around each other when they sleep or just gaze at the stars, and yes, they have sex from time to time \u2014 when it's right for them.You see, people touch each other in many, many different ways, and no single form of touching wins the day. It's what we like to call \"the accumulation of touching\" that matters. Touch the one you love often and in whatever way your heart desires. It's that human connection that wins the day \u2014 and wins the marriage! The simple truth is, the best marriages engage in a lot of touching, and sex is only one form of touching.Creating a successful marriage is not always the easiest thing to do. And truthfully, we've learned in over 30 years of marriage research that there are proven, effective ways to ensure a happy and healthy marriage. In fact, as love and marriage experts, we took hundreds of tips from the thousands of happy couples we interviewed throughout the world and put them into our award-winning and bestselling book, \"Building a Love that Lasts.\"You can see how you stack up to the best marriages around the world.

It's Sooner Than You Think", "context": "A commuter train crashed into Hoboken Terminal on Thursday, killing at least one person and injuring more than 100 others. The accident occurred at 8:45am during the height of rush hour commuter traffic. The train was traveling at a high speed when it crashed through barriers at the end of the track and lifted onto the busy platform. An extreme amount of damage was done to the building's infrastructure, and the near 30,000 people who depend on the busy train station to get to work were left wondering when Hoboken Terminal would reopen. Thankfully, it's sooner than you might think, but it won't be fully functional again for a while.Despite being stopped by the wall of the terminal, at the time of the crash, the train had already left a vast amount of destruction in its wake. Hoboken Terminal is one of the busiest train stations in the New York City area; New Jersey Transit (NJT) cites it as one of its most used stations with 15,000 people boarding trains there each weekday. It's also a popular stop for the PATH Train, which sees more than 28,000 riders use the Hoboken stop on weekdays. People who frequent Hoboken Terminal are obviously shaken by the incident, but anybody living in the New York Metropolitan area will tell you that even in the wake of tragedy, life must go on.In the wake of the crash on Thursday morning, all New Jersey Transit and PATH trains traveling in and out of Hoboken Terminal were indefinitely suspended. The 7 NJT train lines effected by the crash \u2014 New Jersey Coast Line, Morris and Essex County Lines, Main and Bergen Lines, Montclair-Boonton Line, and Pascack Valley Line \u2014 will have their tickets and passes cross honored by NJT buses and many private carriers while Hoboken Terminal remains closed. The Hoboken stop on the PATH train suspended all activity following and the New York Waterway ferry will cross honor rail tickets and passes as well.The PATH train will reopen service going from 33rd street and World Trade Center in Manhattan to Hoboken Terminal around 3 p.m. on Thursday. All activity leaving Hoboken Terminal will still be suspended until further notice. While service in and out of Hoboken Terminal makes commuting difficult for many, there are still ways to get home. If you need to get to Hoboken from Manhattan, the PATH instructs riders to take the train to the Journal Square stop in Jersey City and then transfer to NJT bus 87. NJT buses will accept riders PATH tickets.New Jersey Transit has also released a detailed plan on its website describing how riders will be accommodated on their commute home. NJT will be temporarily expanding its bus service, as well as adjusting its regular train schedules to ensure commuters get where they need to go. If your daily commute has been affected by this horrible crash, keep your eye on NJT's website and Twitter account. Officials will regularly update each to keep NJT riders in the loop of any new adjustments made.It's still unknown when Hoboken Terminal will be fully operational again. The investigation into the incident is ongoing and the damage done to the building is substantial. It's certainly inconvenient to have one of the busiest transportation hubs in the NYC area out of service, but NJT and PATH are doing everything they can to accommodate commuters.", "answers": {"answer_start": [2019], "text": ["3 p.m. on Thursday"]}, "id": "557y8t"}, {"question": "OMG: You Seriously Won't Believe How Much Money Tyga Owes Kylie Jenner", "context": "Kylie Jenner and Tyga are officially no more, and now, according to sources, the reality star is screaming \"b***h better have my money\" at her ex.According to Radar Online, the 18-year-old has been taking care of her 26-year-old ex boo for a while, to the sum of two million dollars \u2014 and now that they're no longer together, she wants him to start paying her back.

Only one of the other teams, Israeli-based SpaceIL, also has a launch contract at the moment. The remaining 14 teams have until December 31 this year to come up with a launch contract to be eligible to take part.The last mission to the Moon's surface was China's Jade Rabbit rover in December 2013 (launch pictured), which recently was pronounced dead.

They're about giant robots who turn into cars and planes, so it's not like incorporating Arthurian legend into the mix really makes the premise that much more bizarre, does it? How the human characters, played by Mark Wahlberg, and a returning Josh Duhamel, will fit into all this is unclear. The fact that those details appear to be missing from this plot would appear to indicate that the rumors that the franchise would be moving toward focusing more on the robots and less on the people may be true. A number of previously appearing Transformers have also been announced for Transformers: The Last Knight, though, if you're actually capable of telling them all apart, you're a better man than I. The film is currently filming in Cuba. While seeing a new Transformers movie is probably not something on your bucket list, the fifth entry in the franchise is on the way, so we'd better all just get used to the idea. Production is underway on Transformers: The Last Knight and we know something about which characters will be returning and a few of the robots in disguise who will be in play. Now, some details about the plot appear to have been revealed, and in true Michael Bay fashion, they are batshit insane. Apparently The Last Knight subtitle is some sort of reference to the King Arthur myth. No, seriously. The Transformers films aren't exactly known for their cogent storytelling, but if the word on Transformers: The Last Knight is accurate, the series is about to achieve a new level of bonkers. According to JoBlo, the new film will open with Optimus Prime discovering the Transformers' home planet of Cybertron, but what he finds is a dead husk of a planet, which he, somehow, is responsible for destroying. The good news is that returning Cybertron to life is possible if Optimus can just obtain a MacGuffin, er artifact. If you just guessed that the artifact is located on earth, you win the grand prize. There's a bit more to it, however, as the artifact is related to Merlin the magician, who, it turns out, received his magic from an early Transformer, because of course he did. CUBA!

There is no \"Crime Statistics Bureau\" in San Francisco; the San Francisco Police Department does release statistics, which instead come from its crime analysis unit; and the police department only tracks crimes in San Francisco.The most widely used source of national crime statistics is the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Report, which compiles data from local police departments every year. It\u2019s an intensive process, and the most recent statistics available are for 2014.Within its homicide data for 2014, the FBI outlines murders based on race, ethnicity, sex of the victim and by race, ethnicity, and sex of the offender when a murder has a single victim and a single offender.Out of 5,703 victims, here\u2019s what the FBI\u2019s statistics say:Black victim/white offender \u2014 8% White victim/white offender \u2014 82% White victim/black offender \u2014 15% Black victim/black offender \u2014 90%Year to year, variations arise, but the numbers are starkly different from Trump\u2019s claim: that the vast majority of whites killed in the U.S. are killed by blacks.

Systrom said in 2011 that he changed the logo because it \"had nothing to do with Instagram,\" and enlisted the help of one of the app's users, designer and photographer Cole Rise, to design a new one back in the fall of 2010.The original Instagram icon Image: InstagramBut that's not the whole story. Mashable caught up with Rise in the wake of Instagram's big change. Far from being bitter over seeing his work cast aside, Rise thinks the new icon is great, which probably isn't surprising since he's a friend and former colleague of both of Instagram's founders.SEE ALSO: Instagram just changed its logo in a big way\"I'm super psyched on the new one,\" Rise says. \"I love the minimalism. Regardless of the colors behind it, the white shape \u2014 the actual bones of the new symbol itself \u2014 is beautiful, and I think that can persist over time.\"Rise says he's also a friend of Robert Padbury, one of the architects of the new icon and one of the designers behind other big tech design changes, including Uber's revamp from earlier this year and Apple's huge shift to flat design in iOS 7.\"If anyone is going to update it, I trust that guy,\" Rise says. \"He's done so many great icons. I'm glad to see him riff on it.\"Genesis of an iconRise's old design came about when the app was virtually brand-new. Systrom and his co-founder, Mike Krieger, had just formally launched Instagram in the App Store after a months-long beta. Rise was an active beta user (in fact, the app's Rise filter is named after him) and had become friends the the pair.Instagram's old app icons (above) vs. the new ones. Image: Instagram\"I was just helping out a couple of buddies of mine who were launching a new photo app,\" recounts Rise. \"I think they're the smartest people in the world. I was really excited about [Instagram] as a photographer.\"When the app was about to launch in October 2010, Apple wanted to put Instagram in the store's \"featured\" section. But there was a problem: The original logo \u2014 which Systrom designed himself and was basically a stylized rendering of a real Polaroid OneStep instant camera \u2014 was using a trademarked design, and it had to go. So Systrom called Rise since he had recently created a camera-like app icon he liked.\"He said, 'We can't use our current icon because of trademark stuff, so I was wondering if we could buy an old icon you had done.' He was referring to an icon I had designed that was inspired by a Bell & Howell camera, an 8mm camera from the '50s.\"Rise's \"Uooo\" icon that served as inspiration for the Instagram icon. Image: Cole RiseRise went to work, and in about 45 minutes, the Instagram logo was born.That icon was spoken for, however. Rise, who has created his own apps over the years, had designed the icon for his startup, but he told Systrom he might be able to rework the design into something for Instagram. Systrom gave him an hour.Rise went to work, and in about 45 minutes, the Instagram logo was born.\"I made this brand-new imaginary camera that was Bell & Howell-inspired, with elements of the old icon so it was an easier transition,\" he says.The logo Rise submitted that day was a less-polished version of the logo we've been tapping on for years. He continued to iterate with Systrom's guidance, adding details like adding an overhead lighting effect, and detailing the room reflected in the camera lens (you can see a window if you look closely). The final version of Rise's icon shipped with Instagram 2.0 in 2011.Instagram 1.0 vs. 2.0 Image: Instagram\"We got really nerdy on it,\" Rise says. \"As a joke, we designed the back of the icon.

He chalks the reaction up to the standard hand-wringing whenever a major product or service changes.\"It's kind of like the Uber redesign \u2014 people freaked out, and now it's totally fine.

Since Inauguration Day, he issued seven executive orders and 11 presidential memorandums.A number of those actions roll back former President Barack Obama's policies and agenda -- another promise that Trump made during the campaign.On Friday, Jan. 27, Trump signed an executive order -- \"Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States\" -- suspending the refugee program for 120 days and halting immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days.The Constitution states that \"executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America.\" However, there's nothing in the Constitution or any federal statute that gives the president the power to issue the directives in any particular way, according to professor Aziz Huq, who teaches law at the University of Chicago.Orders are subject to repeal or modification by Congress in certain cases and review by the Supreme Court.Executive orders and presidential memorandums fall under the umbrella of executive action (as do proclamations). The two types of presidential actions are not quite the same thing, but their effective differences are slight, if any.\"The distinction between these instruments -- executive orders, presidential memoranda and proclamations -- seems to be more a matter of form than of substance, given that all three may be employed to direct and govern the actions of government officials and agencies,\" the Congressional Research Service says in a report.Pew Research recently looked at the history of executive orders and found that Obama issued 277 during his tenure. That pales compared with the number issued by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in his more than 12 years in office \u2014 3,721, according to Pew.According to Huq, an \"executive order is an instruction in writing issued from the White House by the president that is usually directed at an agency or department within the government that ... when it jumps through certain procedural hoops, has the force of law,\" he told ABC News in an interview.One difference between memorandums and orders is that the language may differ, experts say.\"You'll see that in any of the executive orders that Trump issues, there's going to be some phrase right in the beginning that cites either constitutional or statutory authority delegated from Congress,\" said Daniel Gitterman, a public policy professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the author of \"Calling the Shots: The President, Executive Orders and Public Policy.\"Two of Trump's executive orders start with \"By the authority vested in me as president by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows ...\"Executive orders are numbered. After a president signs an executive order, the White House sends the order to the Office of the Federal Register, which keeps a log of all executive orders. The OFR numbers each executive order sequentially.According to Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley of the American Presidency Project, the State Department began numbering executive orders in 1907.Presidents may revoke, modify or replace their own orders and their predecessors', according to the Congressional Research Service.Past executive orders include a controversial one from Roosevelt authorizing the relocation of Japanese-Americans to internment camps during World War II and one from Lyndon Johnson prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, religion, color or national origin in employment by the federal government and its contractors.More recently, Obama used executive orders to impose sanctions on Iran and to establish the Economic Recovery Board after the Great Recession.On Inauguration Day, Trump put his signature on his first presidential memorandum. On Monday he signed three presidential memorandums, including one that withdraws the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and four more memorandums on Tuesday.There is no formal procedure that defines what a presidential memorandum is, what it may do or how it may be issued, according to Huq.\"[Presidential memorandums] are used in the last 20 years much in the same way as an executive order gets used but without the level of formality and process and input from different officials in the administration that executive order requires,\" Huq said.Gitterman believes that the Trump administration will likely use a mix of executive orders and memorandums.Unlike executive orders, memorandums aren't thoroughly recorded by the government.View gallery\"Memorandums go below the radar much more and are harder for, I think, the news media and the public to track,\" Gitterman said.\"It's kind of a problem that we don't have any stable framework for this,\" Huq said of keeping track of presidential directives. \"The way it's done seems to change over time along with the stout necessities of the moment, and that seems very ad hoc.\"Trump's White House appears to be tracking and publishing executive orders, memorandums and proclamations on its website (although it may not be up to date).\"As a matter or historical practice, however, it seems that presidents are more apt to utilize executive orders on matters that may benefit from public awareness or be subject to heightened scrutiny,\" the Congressional Research Service report says. \"Memoranda, on the other hand, are often used to carry out routine executive decisions and determinations or to direct agencies to perform duties consistent with the law or implement laws that are presidential priorities.\"According to the Congressional Research Service, executive orders \"if they are based on appropriate authority ... have the force and effect of law.\"\"While the president's ability to use executive orders as a means of implementing presidential power has been established as a matter of law and practice, it is equally well established that the substance of an executive order, including any requirements or prohibitions, may have the force and effect of law only if the presidential action is based on power vested in the president by the U.S. Constitution or delegated to the president by Congress,\" the CRS says. \"The president's authority to issue executive orders does not include a grant of power to implement policy decisions that are not otherwise authorized by law.\"The report cites a widely accepted 1957 interpretation from the House Government Operations Committee that says executive orders \"usually affect private individuals only indirectly\" while proclamations \"in most instances affect primarily the activities of private individuals.\"The Supreme Court has ruled on the validity of executive orders, and the standard appears to be a 1952 case involving President Harry Truman, the CRS report says. The majority in that case ruled that the president, as executor of the laws, may not make law, deeming an action by Truman unconstitutional.A concurring opinion in that case by Justice Robert Jackson appears to have held the most weight, describing three cases for presidential action: the strongest when the chief executive is expressly authorized by Congress or the Constitution to do something, the next tier for situations in which Congress and the Constitution are silent and the lowest tier for going directly against the will of Congress, the CRS says in its report.In addition to successive presidents, Congress may modify or nullify orders that are based on authority granted to the president by Congress, according to the CRS report, but the legislature has rarely done so in modern times.One die hard New England Patriots' fan proved his love for the Super Bowl champions by naming his newborn son after Tom Brady, the team's star quarterback.

However, Friedman invited them to instead challenge the gay marriage ban itself.Wojcik will be paying close attention to see if couples statewide will have a chance to make their relationships official. Jess plans to go wait at the county clerk's office just in case there's a chance she can go ahead and apply for a license as soon as the ban is overturned.The pair's relationship began three years ago, when Wojcik met Jess on Match.com. On their first date, they talked for hours.\"I knew she would be someone who would have a big impact on my life,\" she said.Though they intended to take it slowly at first, Jess proposed less than a year after they met.\"We like to joke, there was a moment [on our second or third date] when she knew that she could spend her life with me. ... Instead of watching some musical I asked if we could watch a Red Wings game,\" Wojcik said.But their \"happily ever after\" story is marred by the reality of living as a gay couple in Michigan. Wojcik asked that Jess not be identified by her last name because their relationship is a secret from her employer -- in Michigan, you can be fired for being gay.\"We don't consider ourselves that abnormal. We have a dog, we have a house, we pay our taxes, we go to work, we volunteer in our community,\" Wojcik said. \"The only thing that's different about us is there's two women in a relationship.\"The gay marriage ban was approved in 2004 with 59 percent of the vote. Wojcik, who was in high school at the time, said she's seen a shift in how LGBT individuals are treated in Michigan in the last nine years.When the Defense of Marriage Act was overturned, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette issued a statement.\"Michigan\u2019s Constitution stands and the will of the people to define marriage as between one man and one woman endures in the Great Lakes State,\" he said.In September, he filed a brief in the case stating the state's definition of marriage was needed to \"regulate sexual relationships\" and their \"unique procreative capacity.\"If given the chance, Wojcik said, she'd like to invite Schuette to her house for dinner, so he could see \"how normal\" she and Jess are.\"I would hope he understands there is a human element to this, it's not all policy,\" she said.", "answers": {"answer_start": [448], "text": ["Michigan"]}, "id": "390498478360518656"}, {"question": "You'll never guess which iconic movie villain Ramsay Bolton's performance is based on", "context": "HBOGame of Thrones\u2019 Ramsay Bolton is the WORST. He makes Joffrey Baratheon (rest in turmoil, ya jerk!) look like a puppy. In fact, The New York Times gave him the \"Most Hated Man on TV\" title \u2014 which I\u2019m assuming is kinda hard to get, especially when you\u2019re up against Chad from The Bachelor and House of Card\u2018s Frank Underwood.HBOWhat has Ramsay done in order to earn such collective disdain? Well, let\u2019s see. He castrated and mind-destroyed Theon Greyjoy. He tortured and raped Sansa, his bride, on their wedding night (and then some). He killed his dad. He let his dogs EAT his mother-in-law and half-brother. Basically, he\u2019s Satan in human form \u2014 and the actor who plays him (Iwan Rheon) agrees.But while Rheon isn\u2019t a fan either, he still has to play him every day for work. Which is probably hard, since he\u2019s probably a sweet dude at heart who\u2019s also in a folk band. But he has his methods \u2014 one in particular is channeling a very iconic DC villain: Heath Ledger\u2019s The Joker, who was in Batman: The Dark Knight.Warner Bros.In an interview with The Independent, Rheon states that he first used The Joker as inspiration, and then...Dennis the Menace. \"Initially Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker,\" Rheon tells The Independent. \"And then I kind of thought Dennis the Menace... it\u2019s great to have that childlike glee in doing all these horrible things, and then Liam Gallagher\u2019s attitude and walk. But you forget all that stuff after a while.\"Warner Bros.Rheon doesn\u2019t elaborate on his inspirations, but we can see it. The Joker is also a psychopath who gets off on seeing people panic and freak out \u2014 he also likes playing games, which we know Ramsay is very, very fond of. Dennis the Menace, although a pretty dark choice, considering he\u2019s a KID, is also an iconic trickster in film history.Regardless of who Rheon channels when he ruins people\u2019s lives, we can all collectively agree that the episode in which he dies will be a super triumphant one.", "answers": {"answer_start": [971], "text": ["The Joker"]}, "id": "4m7fjp"}, {"question": "When will Hoboken Station Reopen? It's sooner than you think.", "context": "A commuter train crashed into Hoboken Terminal on Thursday, killing at least one person and injuring more than 100 others. The accident occurred at 8:45am during the height of rush hour commuter traffic. The train was traveling at a high speed when it crashed through barriers at the end of the track and lifted onto the busy platform. An extreme amount of damage was done to the building's infrastructure, and the near 30,000 people who depend on the busy train station to get to work were left wondering when Hoboken Terminal would reopen. Thankfully, it's sooner than you might think, but it won't be fully functional again for a while.Despite being stopped by the wall of the terminal, at the time of the crash, the train had already left a vast amount of destruction in its wake. Hoboken Terminal is one of the busiest train stations in the New York City area; New Jersey Transit (NJT) cites it as one of its most used stations with 15,000 people boarding trains there each weekday. It's also a popular stop for the PATH Train, which sees more than 28,000 riders use the Hoboken stop on weekdays. People who frequent Hoboken Terminal are obviously shaken by the incident, but anybody living in the New York Metropolitan area will tell you that even in the wake of tragedy, life must go on.In the wake of the crash on Thursday morning, all New Jersey Transit and PATH trains traveling in and out of Hoboken Terminal were indefinitely suspended. The 7 NJT train lines effected by the crash \u2014 New Jersey Coast Line, Morris and Essex County Lines, Main and Bergen Lines, Montclair-Boonton Line, and Pascack Valley Line \u2014 will have their tickets and passes cross honored by NJT buses and many private carriers while Hoboken Terminal remains closed. The Hoboken stop on the PATH train suspended all activity following and the New York Waterway ferry will cross honor rail tickets and passes as well.NJT bus, private carriers and NY Waterway are honoring NJT rail tickets and passes. PATH service in/out of Hoboken is also suspended. (2/2) \u2014 NJ TRANSIT (@NJTRANSIT) September 29, 2016The PATH train will reopen service going from 33rd street and World Trade Center in Manhattan to Hoboken Terminal around 3 p.m. on Thursday. All activity leaving Hoboken Terminal will still be suspended until further notice. While service in and out of Hoboken Terminal makes commuting difficult for many, there are still ways to get home. If you need to get to Hoboken from Manhattan, the PATH instructs riders to take the train to the Journal Square stop in Jersey City and then transfer to NJT bus 87. NJT buses will accept riders PATH tickets.New Jersey Transit has also released a detailed plan on its website describing how riders will be accommodated on their commute home. NJT will be temporarily expanding its bus service, as well as adjusting its regular train schedules to ensure commuters get where they need to go. If your daily commute has been affected by this horrible crash, keep your eye on NJT's website and Twitter account. Officials will regularly update each to keep NJT riders in the loop of any new adjustments made.USE THE LINK BELOW TO SEE THE MODIFIED SCHEDULE FOR TODAY 9/29. https://t.co/lnDiKkpkYI \u2014 NJ TRANSIT (@NJTRANSIT) September 29, 2016It's still unknown when Hoboken Terminal will be fully operational again.

Helen Williams explains.'Use with caution'The British Heart Foundation (BHF) said patients should be on the lowest dose possible of NSAIDs for the shortest possible time.Prof Peter Weissberg, medical director at the BHF, said: \"This large observational study reinforces previous research showing that some NSAIDs, a group of drugs commonly taken by patients with joint problems, increase the risk of developing heart failure.\"It has been known for some years now that such drugs need to be used with caution in patients with, or at high risk of, heart disease.\"This applies mostly to those who take them on a daily basis rather than only occasionally.\"Since heart and joint problems often coexist, particularly in the elderly, this study serves as a reminder to doctors to consider carefully how they prescribe NSAIDs, and to patients that they should only take the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time.\"They should discuss their treatment with their GP if they have any concerns.\"Younger patientsHelen Williams, consultant pharmacist for cardiovascular disease at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the focus needed to be on older patients with conditions or diseases that might put them at increased risk of heart failure anyway.\"Hypertension, diabetes, maybe kidney problems - it's in those patients when we add these drugs on top that there might be a small increase in their risk,\" she said.Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \"The consequence is that it is of very little relevance to most people below age 65 taking painkillers, but in the very elderly, say, above 80, that the effects are of more relevance.\"Ms Williams said that younger patients who took short courses of ibuprofen, for example, should not be worried. However, she did warn against young people taking the drugs regularly.\"If you take a very occasional course - it's like most people will do for aches and pains, sports injuries etcetera - then there's no need to worry.\"But she added: \"I think I would say if you're a young person who is regularly going to buy these drugs, and effectively taking them all the time, you probably should be supervised by a clinician because there are other issues with these drugs and we might want to keep an eye, for example, on your kidneys.\"Ms Williams also said it was important to use over-the-counter painkillers for the right reasons.She said: \"Ibuprofen are anti-inflammatory drugs so if you've damaged your muscles where there's likely to be inflammation, then ibuprofen might be appropriate.\"If you've got a headache, it's unlikely that there's going to be an inflammation issue and paracetamol is fine.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [177], "text": ["NSAIDs"]}, "id": "5510f1"}, {"question": "Lisbon Mom Makes \u20ac5,460/Month From Home And You Won't Believe How She Does It!", "context": "As Seen On: As Seen On:Maria puts her computer to work and makes money while working from home.

Comoros, where women hold 20 percent of ministerial positions and where wives generally keep land or the home after divorce, came out on top, followed by Oman, Kuwait, Jordan and Qatar.The poll by Thomson Reuters' philanthropic arm surveyed 336 gender experts in August and September in 21 Arab League states and Syria, which was a founding member of the Arab League but was suspended in 2011.Questions were based on provisions of the U.N. Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which 19 Arab states have signed or ratified.The poll assessed violence against women, reproductive rights, treatment of women within the family, their integration into society and attitudes towards a woman's role in politics and the economy.Experts were asked to respond to statements and rate the importance of factors affecting women's rights across the six categories. Their responses were converted into scores, which were averaged to create a ranking.(Visit http://poll2012.trust.org) for a detailed methodology and full results.)SEXUAL HARASSMENTEgypt scored badly in almost all categories.Women played a central role in the country's revolution but activists say the rising influence of Islamists, culminating in the election of Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Morsi as president, was a major setback for women's rights.Morsi was toppled in a military takeover in July after mass protests against his rule, but hopes for greater freedoms have been tempered by the daily dangers facing women on the street, experts said.A U.N. report on women in April said 99.3 percent of women and girls are subjected to sexual harassment in Egypt, which some analysts say reflects a general rise in violence in Egyptian society over the past half-decade.Human Rights Watch reported that 91 women were raped or sexually assaulted in public in Tahrir Square in June as anti-Morsi protests heated up.\"The social acceptability of everyday sexual harassment affects every woman in Egypt regardless of age, professional or socio-economic background, marriage status, dress or behavior,\" said Noora Flinkman, communications manager at HarassMap, a Cairo-based rights group that campaigns against harassment.\"It limits women's participation in public life. It affects their safety and security, their sense of worth, self-confidence and health.\"Respondents also cited high rates of forced marriage and trafficking.\"There are whole villages on the outskirts of Cairo and elsewhere where the bulk of economic activity is based on trafficking in women and forced marriages,\" said Zahra Radwan, Middle East and North Africa program officer for the Global Fund for Women, a U.S.-based rights group.Female genital mutilation is endemic in Egypt, where 91 percent of women and girls - 27.2 million in all - are subjected to cutting, according to UNICEF. Only Djibouti has a higher rate, with 93 percent of women and girls cut.In Iraq, women's freedoms have regressed since the U.S.-led 2003 invasion and overthrow of Saddam Hussein, the poll showed.A decade of instability and conflict has affected women disproportionately. Domestic abuse and prostitution have increased, illiteracy has soared and up to 10 percent of women - or 1.6 million - have been left widowed and vulnerable, according to Refugees International.Hundreds of thousands of women displaced internally and across borders are vulnerable to trafficking, kidnapping and rape, the U.N. refugee agency says.In Saudi Arabia, ranked third worst, experts noted some advances. The kingdom remains the only country that bans female drivers but cautious reforms pushed by King Abdullah have given women more employment opportunities and a greater public voice.Since January, 30 women have been appointed to the 150-member Shoura Council, the nearest thing Saudi Arabia has to a parliament - but the council has no legislative or budgetary powers.Saudi Arabia's guardianship system forbids women from working, travelling abroad, opening a bank account or enrolling in higher education without permission from a male relative.\"Saudi society is a patriarchal society and all its laws pertain to the rights of men,\" said a Saudi legal advisor who defends victims of domestic abuse. \"The woman is considered second class.\"WOMEN AS WEAPONS OF WARSyria's civil war has had a devastating impact on women at home and in refugee camps across borders, where they are vulnerable to trafficking, forced and child marriage and sexual violence, experts said.Rights groups say forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have targeted women with rape and torture, while hardline Islamists have stripped them of rights in rebel-held territory.\"The Syrian woman is a weapon of war, subjected to abductions and rape by the regime and other groups,\" a Syrian women's rights campaigner said.The poll highlighted a mixed picture for women's rights in other Arab Spring countries.In Yemen, ranked fifth worst, women protested side-by-side with men during the 2011 revolution and there is a 30 percent quota for women in a national dialogue conference convened to discuss constitutional reforms.But they face an uphill struggle for rights in a largely conservative country where child marriage is common - there isno minimum marriage age - and the U.S. State Department says 98.9 percent of women have faced harassment on the streets.In Libya, ranked 14th for women's rights, experts voiced concern over the spread of armed militias and a rise in kidnapping, extortion, random arrests and physical abuse of women. They said the uprising that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi two years ago had failed to enshrine women's rights in law.Women in 12th-ranked Bahrain are more active in political life than in many Gulf states, but experts said sectarianism was a barrier to rights following the Sunni regime's crushing of a pro-democracy uprising by majority Shi'ites in 2011.In Tunisia, ranked best among Arab Spring nations, women hold 27 percent of seats in national parliament and contraception is legal, but polygamy is spreading and inheritance laws are biased towards males.Along with Syria, all Arab League member states except Somalia and Sudan have signed or ratified CEDAW.

That's right, vodka can be used as a way to clean your mattress, which is often an overlooked task, even though you sleep -- i.e., sweat -- on it every night. The alcohol kills odor-causing bacteria while it also disinfects the mattress\u2014unlike cleaning sprays that often only mask smells with a scent. Not to mention a cheap 750-ml bottle (25.36 fluid ounces) of vodka costs less than $10, while a 16.9-fluid-ounce cleaning spray costs around $5 and won't last nearly as long. This is why Jolie Kerr, cleaning expert and author of My Boyfriend Barfed in My Handbag and Other Things You Can't Ask Martha, suggests vodka as an easy cleaning solution. Simply pour vodka into a spray bottle, distribute it evenly across your mattress by spritzing and leave it to air-dry before remaking your bed. \"The key is to spritz the mattress lightly -- you don't want to saturate it, or else it will never dry,\" says Kerr.The Spray That Gets Rid of Those Unmentionable Bedroom InvadersResearchers at Alexandria University in Egypt found certain essential oils to be effective at killing dust mites\u2014the invisible-unless-under-a-microscope creatures that tend to live in bedding, carpets, furniture and drapes. If you want to keep your allergies at bay, eucalyptus and clove were proven to be the most effective oils for eliminating household dust mites. Add around 10 drops of an oil in with your laundry detergent when you wash your sheets in hot water; fill a spray bottle with 1 quart of water and 20 drops of an oil to spray on upholstery; or, put baking soda in a sifter and add in 10 drops of an essential oil to shake across carpeting. Then leave the mixture on the floor for 30 minutes and vacuum it up.The Fruit That Cleans Your Microwave in a ZapIt's bad enough that you completely blackened your bag of popcorn, but even worse when that distinct smell makes its way into every food you put in the microwave for weeks afterward -- even after you have cleaned the microwave with soap and water. Tricky smells, such as from burnt foods, are easily absorbed into the microwave and take more than a good scouring to get rid of. Kerr says the easiest way to deodorize a microwave and clean it is to cut a lemon in half, sprinkle it with some kosher salt and then to scrub the microwave interior with it. \"The scent of the lemon, combined with the citric acid will help to neutralize any lingering odors.\" And for those of us who just wish the smell would go away on its own, this trick comes pretty close: Put a bowl of white vinegar in the microwave and shut the door. \"You don't even need to turn it on,\" says Kerr. \"Just let the vinegar work its magic for an hour, or so, and the smells will be gone.\"The Salon Staple That'll Keep Your Bathroom SparklingSure, you've heard of Bar Keepers Friend as a way to remove rust rings from your bathtub, but there's an easier solution to prevent those stubborn marks before they even start. Coat the undersides of your shaving-cream can, metal soap dish or any other rust-causing culprits with clear nail polish, which puts a protective layer between the item and your pearly white tub.The DIY Cleaning Solution That Works in Any RoomIf your household is prone to drink and/or food spills, don't waste money going through containers upon containers of cleaning wipes. Instead, make your own for a fraction of the cost with Fabulessly Frugal's easy recipe, which includes items that are probably already lying around your kitchen: paper towels, vinegar, water, a few drops of dish soap and of an essential oil (although not necessary, the latter helps to mask the smell of vinegar).

While scientists have previously recommended engaging in mentally challenging activities, a new study suggests that keeping a packed schedule may offer similar benefits.In a survey of over 300 people participating in the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study, study authors found that among adults over the age of 50, having a busy schedule was associated with better brain processing, improved memory, sharper reasoning and better vocabulary.People in the study ranged from 50 to 89 years old, and the positive effect of busyness on the brain was consistent across age. This, the study authors conclude, suggests that keeping a busy lifestyle is important in middle age as well as old age.It\u2019s possible that staying busy increases people\u2019s ability to learn new things, as they may be exposed to different situations, people, and information on a daily basis, the researchers suggest. But it\u2019s also possible that people with higher cognitive abilities are also more likely to be busier. The study cannot definitively determine that busyness alone causes better brain health.And what about the stress that can come from maintaining a tight schedule? \"We certainly considered that being very busy could hurt cognition,\" says study author Denise Park, director of research at the Center for Vital Longevity at The University of Texas at Dallas. \"Basically, the data suggest that the benefits of busyness outweigh the downside.\"Park says her team plans to further study the effects of busyness on the brain to hopefully further untangle the factors that improve or hamper cognition later in life.", "answers": {"answer_start": [170], "text": ["stay busy"]}, "id": "1100188040002123_1111249302229330"}, {"question": "Formula One legend fights for his life after skiing accident", "context": "GRENOBLE, France, Dec 30 - Former Formula One champion Michael Schumacher was battling for his life in hospital on Monday after a ski injury, doctors said, adding it was too early to say whether he would pull through.\"We can say that his condition is life-threatening,\" Jean-Francois Payen, head anaesthetician at the CHU hospital in the eastern French city of Grenoble told a news conference.\"For the moment we cannot say what Schumacher's future is,\" he added.Seven-times Formula One world champion Schumacher was admitted to hospital on Sunday suffering head injuries in an off-piste skiing accident in the French Alps resort of Meribel.Neurosurgeon Stephan Chabardes said an emergency brain scan carried out on Schumacher, 44, had revealed internal bleeding, and injuries including contusions and lesions.

If it does, the second-largest U.S. city would become the country's largest GMO-free zone.Two LA city councilmen on Friday introduced a motion that would ban the growth, sale and distribution of genetically engineered seeds and plants. The councilmen, Paul Koretz and Mitch O\u2019Farrell, said the measure is meant to protect local gardens and homegrown food from contamination by genetically modified seeds. The motion would not affect the sale of food containing genetically modified ingredients.\"We don't want to consume mystery food,\" O'Farrell told The Huffington Post. \"Since there's currently no requirement, anyone could unwittingly purchase a genetically modified product and not know it. I think that's irresponsible.\"Genetically modified organisms have had their DNA altered by genetic engineering -- for example, a gene from another plant species, bacterium or virus may have been introduced into the organism's DNA. Genetically modified seeds are used mostly by large farmers, of which there are none in LA. \"But if they become marketed to home gardeners, we're going to have this ban in place,\" David King, head of Learning Garden and Seed Library of LA, told HuffPost.\"The pending ordinance would be symbolic more than anything else, but we do feel it's an important step to have the second-largest city in the nation declare itself as against genetically modified seeds,\" said King, who helped craft the motion.Joanne Poyourow, executive director of Environmental Changemakers of LA, said targeting city gardeners is easier than large farmers.\"Right now, it is very challenging to save that diversity in the farmlands, but we think we can provide significant help in saving that diversity by saving seeds within the cities,\" said Poyourow, who also worked on the motion.Poyourow is part of a community of heirloom seed-savers in LA. \"Our objective is to preserve a large area where heirloom seeds can safely be saved,\" she said.O'Farrell said he thinks the worldwide decline of honeybees is the \"canary in the coal mine\" for GMOs. U.S. World commercial beehives declined 40 to 50 percent in 2012, with the suspicions of some beekeepers and researchers falling on powerful new pesticides incorporated into plants themselves. In California, almond agriculture, which depends on bees, has been hit especially hard. About 80 percent of the nation's almonds are produced in central California.\"A growing number of problems are being traced to GMOs,\" Koretz said in a statement. In addition to loss of bees, he cited \"the evolution of 'superbug' insects which are growing immune to the pesticides engineered within GMO crops\" and \"'seed drift' (for example the recent finding of GMO-pollinated wheat growing in an Oregon farmer\u2019s field).\"Proponents of GMOs -- including food, biotech and chemical companies -- say there is no research proving that genetically modified food has less nutritional value than non-modified food. They also point out that genetic modification allows for insect- and weather-resistant crops that can help meet a rising global food demand.The LA motion comes weeks before Washington state will vote on ballot initiative 522, which calls for labeling food products that contain genetically modified ingredients.Last November, Californians narrowly defeated Proposition 37, which would have made California the first state to require that genetically modified food be labeled. Monsanto, Kraft and Coca-Cola were among companies contributing to what became a $46-million \"No on Prop 37\" radio and television campaign. Proponents raised $9.2 million.The U.S. has no requirement to label genetically modified food. In the last several years, a few U.S. localities, including San Juan County, Wash., and Mendocino County, Marin County and Arcata, Calif., have banned the cultivation of genetically modified organisms.\"If we aren\u2019t going to be able to rely on our state or federal leaders to do something about GMOs, we can act locally,\" O'Farrell said. \"This statement goes beyond LA to the big food companies.

Daenerys? Tyrion? Jon Snow? Hodor? Every time a character seems to be developing into a protagonist, he or she is brutally killed (video). Such is the perilous existence of the major players in the world of the wildly popular HBO series\u2014when you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.But several main characters remain. And in order to determine the one true hero of them all\u2014the one most vital to the story, with the most important connections to other characters\u2014we must turn to math.Andrew J. Beveridge, an associate professor of mathematics at Macalester College, and Jie Shan, an intrepid undergraduate, decided to turn the world of the Game of Thrones books into a social network using network science, a branch of applied graph theory that draws from several disciplines, including economics, sociology, and, computer science, to examine how information flows from one thing to another.The books and HBO fantasy series, with their massive cast of characters, various shifting allegiances, and intricate relationship dynamics, were a perfect fit to be studied mathematically.\"This is a fanciful application of network science,\" Beveridge told Quartz. \"But it\u2019s the kind of accessible application that shows what mathematics is all about, which is finding and explaining patterns.\" Their research, entitled \"Network of Thrones,\" is published in the Mathematical Association of America\u2019s publication, Math Horizons (pdf).The pair started by connecting characters every time they \"interacted\" in the third book of the series, A Storm of Swords. Whenever two characters appeared within 15 words of one another, a link (or \"edge\") was added between them. The links are weighted based on how often the two characters appeared in close proximity. Characters don\u2019t necessarily have to be friends to be linked\u2014which is a good thing because there are few true friendships in the series.The resulting network structure (above) broke the characters into extremely accurate communities that show the geographical, familial, and even adversarial ties between them.\"We didn\u2019t tell it what the communities were, the network actually tells you what the communities are,\" Beveridge said.Then the mathematicians ranked the characters by several different measures. One, called degree centrality, simply ranks the characters by how many others they\u2019re connected with. Other measures, like PageRank (the same algorithm that Google uses for its search engine), actually puts the characters into a feedback loop, rewarding them based on how important the people that they\u2019re associated with are in the network.Ranked first in every measure, save for one, was the same character: Tyrion, the sharp-witted, marginalized member of powerful house Lannister. In spite of his small size, Tyrion is mathematically the most important character in Game of Thrones.Tyrion is followed by Jon Snow, the (former) head of the Night\u2019s Watch and bastard son of Eddard Stark, and then Sansa Stark, one of Eddard\u2019s daughters, who finds herself in several precarious situations throughout the story.The results aren\u2019t too surprising, given that Tyrion has the most point-of-view chapters in the book series, with 49. That said, the network experiment didn\u2019t reflect the number of POV chapters per character exactly. For example, Arya Stark, Sansa\u2019s younger sister, has the third most chapters with 34, but ranks behind Sansa in terms of network importance. To the chagrin of younger siblings everywhere, in this case, at least, big sister is just a little more valuable.Daenerys Targaryen, the \"Mother of Dragons\" and true heir to the Iron Throne, is also very important. But her ranking is hindered a bit by being isolated on the continent Essos, away from most of the main action on Westeros. She\u2019s still vital to the network, though, because the characters on Westeros she is connected to are very important, and all characters essentially must go through her in order to interact with others on Essos.Beveridge argued that the network science can actually predict where the story is headed, citing Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s connections as an example. (Indeed, her story really picks up two books later.)\"Daenerys really represents the future\u2014you can see whats about to happen based on the people she\u2019s linked with,\" Beveridge said.", "answers": {"answer_start": [118], "text": ["Tyrion"]}, "id": "832305003567652_920833148048170"}, {"question": "The Crew Of A Disney Cruise Ship Saw Something In The Water That SHOULD NOT Have Been There...", "context": "The crew pulled the 22-year-old man out of the ocean and brought him on board.Then the captain ordered the ship to dock at Punta Langsota, the nearest landfall with medical facilities, to transport the man to a clinic for care.

This person, whose true identity has still not been disclosed, released a white paper amid the 2008 credit crisis explaining the digital currency. He and subsequent bitcoin \"miners\" created the early units of the currency shortly thereafter.Each unit has an encrypted key which fits uniquely into a spot in the so-called blockchain. Every piece of bitcoin created has a unique spot on this blockchain. This special construction ensures security during transactions as well as prevents counterfeiting.Because of these security features, bitcoin removes an essential element that was thought to be necessary for every financial transaction: trust.If trust isn't needed, one doesn't need that middleman when making a wire transfer (credit card companies), states the author.The middleman needed to ensure both parties meet their commitments for a home, car or business loan (banks) isn't needed either.Kelly writes:\"The Bitcoin protocol replaces the banker with the miner and by doing so removes the cost of a middleman. The traditional role of the banker was to be a trusted third party, watching every transaction and verifying validity. Satoshi Nakamoto designed a way for a computer to replace a banker. Bitcoin can accomplish this task securely through the use of cryptography.\"Even the Federal Reserve is expendable, as bitcoin doesn't need a large governing body to tell everyone it is sound. The computer code ensures that, notes Kelly.And because there is a natural process of creating bitcoins through its encrypted mining process as well as an already-determined maximum amount that can be created, it doesn't need the Fed's money supply function either.What may not be known to many, but is essential to Kelly's financial takeover thesis, is that each bitcoin has the ability to be programmed with smart instructions. For example, it can be programmed to release a certain amount of money over a designated period of time.This \"smart contract\" can be embedded into the bitcoin security encryption; therefore, the parties can't flake on their commitment once it is digitally signed.\"The smart money features of Bitcoin can even be used to eliminate trust banks when transferring generational wealth,\" writes Kelly.Read MoreThe big problem with bitcoin regulationsBitcoin can even streamline the once-thought-to-be-difficult securitization process\u2014the purview of investment banks\u2014through this programmable interface.\"Traditional bankers stand at the center of the financial system and ensure that money moves from one rightful owner to another,\" Kelly writes. \"The Bitcoin miners do the same thing but without the need to employ thousands or erect skyscrapers.\"Credit card companies, threatened by bitcoin's ability to transfer money around the world at virtually no cost, apparently already hear the footsteps. MasterCard filed a patent in June of this year to integrate bitcoins into the company's global shopping cart, according to the book.To be sure, bitcoin has a long road ahead before taking over the whole financial system, which Kellly acknowledges. Before bitcoin and bitcoin digital wallets are widely adopted and accepted, one must still use U.S. dollars and a credit card company to buy bitcoin through an exchange.And while bitcoin is trustless and secure in a vacuum, these exchanges are not. They are only as secure as their firewalls.The failure of of Japan's Mt.Gox exchange last year after a hacking was proof of that. Millions of dollars in bitcoins are still missing.And until Fidelity and JPMorgan Chase close down due to competition from bitcoin-backed upstarts, grandma and grandpa are nowhere close to moving their checking and retirement accounts over to a bitcoin-based system.Bitcoin may be a trustless transaction system, but a majority of people must understand and trust it can function as such before it starts replacing currencies and related financial middleman on a large scale.But Kelly, who got his start in the business ironically as an intern for Lehman Brothers, was admittedly a skeptic at first, too.It was the collapse of his former employer and the disappearance of trust in the financial system in its wake that led Kelly and many others to find bitcoin and ultimately believe in it.Hopefully, another crisis of that magnitude isn't what's necessary for bitcoin's mass adoption.\"The financial crisis of 2008 fertilized the ground for economic change,\" the author writes. \"Bitcoin and the blockchain will play a starring role in the new economy.\"\"The Bitcoin Big Bang\" by Brian Kelly is published by John Wiley & Sons.", "answers": {"answer_start": [148], "text": ["Bitcoin"]}, "id": "539993699548409857"}, {"question": "Meet the most important person in education you've never heard of", "context": "NEW YORK -- Growing up in downtown Manhattan as the son of a psychiatrist and a college president, David Coleman never wanted for stimulation. At the dinner table, his parents repeatedly told him that it wasn't his exam scores that mattered, but rather the quality of his ideas and inquiry.\"They cared more about the quality of what I did and the engagement with ideas than they did about other measures of success,\" he said, speaking in his brightly-lit Columbus Circle office, where a black-and-white Martin Luther King Jr. photograph hangs on the wall.When Coleman heard stories of other parents who paid their kids to get high exam scores, he said, \"I just thought how lucky I was.\"Now, Coleman is in charge of the most important test score a student can receive. As president of the College Board, a national education company, he is redesigning the SAT, the standardized test taken by many high school seniors as a part of the college application process. He is also expanding the Advanced Placement program, which offers college-level classes and tests for high school students.Coleman, a playful 43-year-old man who speaks at an urgent clip, is the most influential education figure you've never heard of.He is perhaps best known as the architect of the Common Core State Standards Initiative, meant to bring divergent state learning goals into alignment. Public schools in 47 states will begin teaching the Common Core in English language fields this fall. But as standardized testing comes increasingly under attack, and as teachers and politicians from both the left and right try to roll back the Common Core, Coleman's legacy is a bit up in the air.The controversy over Common Core has become particularly fraught as states adopt its learning goals. In Alabama, for instance, a Republican political activist recently compared adoption of the core to Adolf Hitler's indoctrination of German citizens. Although few states have dropped the Core entirely, several have distanced themselves from the program by withdrawing from the consortia charged with developing assessments to measure student achievement under its rubric.Coleman said he hopes the standards can succeed without full national participation in the consortia, but many Core proponents disagree. \"You're going to end up with a bunch of states doing different things,\" said Andy Rotherham, a friend of Coleman's who worked in the Clinton administration and now leads Bellwether Education Partners, a Washington, D.C.-based consulting firm. \"Some of the same issues will persist, which undermines the premise of Common Core.\"How did Coleman wind up in the middle of the 21st century's curriculum wars?His path started at his parents' dinner table and wended through selective New York public school Stuyvesant High, making an important pit stop at his bar mitzvah. After being asked to perform a deep exegesis of his Torah portion, Coleman extracted a lesson that would guide his career: \"The idea that kids can do more than we think they can,\" he said. Asking 13-year-olds to give a speech is a bold charge, not unlike recommending AP courses to disadvantaged kids who don't see academic aptitude in themselves. \"I wish kids could encounter more stretched opportunities like that in school -- all kids,\" Coleman said.After graduating from Stuyvesant, Coleman attended Yale and was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford, where he studied English literature. He also met Jason Zimba, a Common Core co-writer and lifelong friend who later taught mathematics at Bennington College, where Coleman's mother, Elizabeth, served as president. Zimba remembers hanging out in pubs and playing Risk with Coleman, who spent the rest of his time studying for exams. Coleman had a competitive streak and often won at Risk. \"He's an astute observer of characters, so if he thinks you can handle it, he might celebrate [his victory over you],\" he said.Upon returning to New York, Coleman applied for a high school teaching position and was turned down. Instead, he worked for consulting firm McKinsey & Company, where he advised public schools and became a fixture at New York City Department of Education meetings. That's where he met David Sherman, then a vice president at the United Federation of Teachers.After one meeting, Coleman, then in his 20s, approached Sherman. \"'I don't know you, but I want to introduce myself, because you seem to be the only person who knew what he was talking about,'\" Sherman remembers Coleman saying. They stayed in touch. In 1999, when Zimba and Coleman developed their education startup, the Grow Network, Coleman turned to Sherman to tap into the grassroots involvement of teachers.Sherman became a mentor to Coleman. \"I always told him he was too nice, that you need to stand up for what you believe in,\" Sherman said. And when Coleman began speaking to national audiences, Sherman chided Coleman for treating Washington crowds as if they were New Yorkers. \"I said, 'David, you can't curse in front of a national audience, they get offended.'\"While working on the Grow Network, Coleman tried to \"fill the promise that assessment results could actually improve kids' lives,\" he said. But he found that educational problems ran deeper: The standards being measured by the tests \"were so vast and vague, it's hard to make high-quality assessments.\" Coleman sold the Grow Network to McGraw-Hill and formed Student Achievement Partners, a not-for-profit that now helps states implement the Common Core. In 2008, he and Zimba co-wrote a seminal paper calling for \"math and science standards that are fewer, clearer, higher.\"Before Coleman and Zimba published their paper, in 2008, the National Governors Association convened a group to create a set of unified national education standards. Because states write their own standards and exams, students who move across state lines might find themselves passing math in one state and failing in another. The governors sought to address this problem by creating common standards. Attracted to Coleman's idea of \"fewer, clearer, higher,\" they tapped Student Achievement Partners to write those standards.\"While sometimes I've been called an architect of their standards, I think their true architecture is evidence,\" Coleman said. \"That's the binding secret of the standards.\" Coleman, Zimba and Sue Pimentel, an education consultant, made sure the standards reflect the skills students need to succeed after high school.While the standards were developed by state representatives, with help from the Gates Foundation, they received a new, powerful -- but in retrospect, potentially detrimental -- boost in 2009. That year, the Obama administration incentivized higher learning standards with billions of dollars in its Race to the Top competition, and recession-stunned states signed on to the Core. \"The states were so desperate for money they were willing to just do it,\" said Andy Smarick, a Republican education policy expert who previously worked for the U.S. Department of Education. \"So many states signed on so fast with a push from the federal government and there wasn't a fuss -- until now.\"As schools begin to implement the Core, far-right and far-left advocates are trying to roll it back. People like Ron Paul, the former libertarian-leaning Republican U.S. congressman from Texas, are waging campaigns against the Core, making the fight a tea party priority. Reached by phone, Paul said that he sees the Core as an \"encroachment\" that increases the federal government's control. \"This is just another step, putting pressure on states to have a one-system, universal curriculum,\" he said. \"This is the kind of thing that should not be permitted.\" Paul said he had not read \"all of the standards, but that's in some ways irrelevant, because the principle is so bad.\"On the left, advocates such as Diane Ravitch, a former George H.W. Bush education official who is now a leading figure in opposition to the so-called education reform movement, say that the Core could lead to more assessments when students are already overburdened by excessive testing.\"The conservative right is using it as an example of government control, a break with states' rights -- but it's voluntary,\" said Sherman, who now works as a special assistant to Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. \"People like Ravitch are saying it has all of the testing and blah blah blah. I don't go along with that, either.\"Ravitch and other critics, though, also worry about the Core's contents. \"There is no evidence that those who study these standards will be prepared for careers, because there is nothing in them that bears any relationship to careers,\" Ravitch recently wrote on The Huffington Post's blog.A major component of that evidence, according to the Common Core appendix, relies on the ACT's benchmark reports on college and career readiness. To define college and career readiness, the ACT surveyed U.S. colleges and determined how much a student has to know in a given subject to have a 50 percent or higher likelihood of earning a B, or a 75 percent or higher chance of earning a C. The reports follow students who take the ACT's through college. But even the ACT's education director has conceded that the reports are limited because they don't tie the students being studied to data about their life outcomes or careers.\"It's like pointing a shotgun at a football field,\" said Anthony Carnevale, a Georgetown University professor who oversees the school's Center on Education and the Workforce, in an earlier interview. \"The things mentioned in the ACT subject exams don't show up in tasks and activities of jobs -- any jobs.\" That limitation leads Carnevale to believe that the Core's academic focus could ultimately deepen rifts between students who are already on a path to college and those who plan to pursue a career straight out of high school. Those students, he says, could lose interest in more abstract subjects, like higher algebra, and drop out. \"[Core proponents] can argue much more persuasively that the standards make you college ready, but not career ready,\" he said.To rebut arguments such as Carnevale's, Coleman has said that the Core will teach students how to think critically, a crucial skill in an ever-changing economy.Coleman said he thinks that when people like Paul do read the standards, they will support them. It's the substance, he said, that's brought Republicans such as Mike Huckabee and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on board. \"Whatever missteps were made in the past with the administration and Race to the Top, the secretary has made very clear, this is and remains state led,\" Coleman said. \"And any state can withdraw at any time, which is being demonstrated.\"But if more states drop out, the effort could lose momentum. \"If it's adopted by a tiny number of states, it ceases to have the meaning it once had,\" said Tim Daly, president of the teacher placement firm TNTP.As the fight over the Core plays out, Coleman has taken a broader view on education. Last summer, the College Board announced that it would hire him to lead the organization. Since then, he has engaged the organization's members in redesigning the SAT, whose newest iteration will be unveiled in 2015.He's heard from organization members, who have said they want the SAT to test things that are relevant to college success. They've told him that students should be able to read and write clearly, and also have mastered a core set of mathematical concepts. \"The core aspiration is to build an exam that much more clearly focuses on the skills that matter most,\" he said. Instead of obscure vocabulary words, students should be expected to show deep understanding of academic terms such as \"synthesis\" and \"transform.\" Overall, Coleman hopes the exam will be more relevant to high school learning. \"It has to engage teachers more deeply,\" he said.As students go back to school and stress over college applications this year, they probably don't know about the man with the funny socks in the Columbus Circle office who, in a sense, influences their future. \"He's in this position to tie what kids are learning to what colleges are expecting,\" Smarick said. \"Very few people in America today are having a bigger influence on what kids are learning than David Coleman.\"This story was written in partnership with the Jewish Daily Forward.", "answers": {"answer_start": [99], "text": ["David Coleman"]}, "id": "373589246046507008"}, {"question": "She removes the bristles from a toothbrush and turns it into THIS", "context": "The first thing you need to do is put the toothbrush in boiling water.

DGLimages/ThinkstockM any American colleges and universities convened classes this week, and as students take tours of all the any American colleges and universities convened classes this week, and as students take tours of all the safe spaces and water parks (or, if they\u2019re in Texas, as they burnish their firearm collections ), they are likely feeling more pressure than ever to maintain high GPAs. Whether due to financial aid requirements, sports scholarships, naked ambition, or just plain fear of their parents, many students care deeply about their gradesThis leads thousands of them, every semester, at every postsecondary institution in this great land, to utter one fateful plea to the person on the other side of the lectern. They make this plea to help them achieve their goals, yet it is one of the most ill-advised things any student can do. It usually arrives via email at a strange hour of the night. It goes like this:\"Professor, I NEED an A in this class.\"All right, I admit: I\u2019m indulging in the time-honored rhetorical device of hyperbole. Not all professors get this all the time. Sometimes the grade students \"need\" is a B or a C; on rare occasions, they\u2019ll send a plaintive appeal for a D-minus. But seriously, anyone who has taught a college class has probably come across a version of the \"need-a-grade.\"Alas, no peer-reviewed article exists in the Journal of Transcript-Based Pedagogical Outcomes and Definitive Assessment Precis Rankings on this demand\u2019s exact frequency, so you will have to make do with this veritable shitstorm of anecdotal evidence that occurred on my extremely scientific Twitter feed within a single hour of this meek inquiry: \"Professors and professor-adjacent, show of hands: Has a student ever told you they \"need\" a certain grade? What did you do?\" (Responses ran the entire spectrum from extreme compassion to \" out of office reply .\")Yes, there\u2019s a lot of need in the college classroom these days. And it needs to stop. Not only because it\u2019s disrespectful, grating, and woefully ignorant of the way college assessment works, but, more importantly, because the deluge of \"need\" obscures some actual needs.When a student claims to need a certain grade, she is operating under the assumption that grades are doled out arbitrarily\u2014the result of a professor\u2019s whim and mood. This stands in stark contrast to reality, which is that in an ever-more-tortured aim at transparency and fairness \u2014even in so-called \"subjective\" disciplines like the humanities\u2014a professor\u2019s grading system often comes courtesy of multiple tortured rubrics. Those rubrics are themselves tied to ever-more-intransigent \" learning outcomes ,\" resulting in an intricate web of math and check marks, all of which are explained in detail on pages 450-499 of the 900-page syllabusWait, are those kegstands recreational, or a cry for help?Assessment metrics are meticulously thought-out these days. They\u2019re specifically designed to eliminate extraneous subjectivity. The assumption that they can be chucked on the basis of a particularly forceful series of emails is enough to make an overworked professor scream, Oh, you NEED an A, do you? I didn\u2019t REALIZE! I was just giving you a B-minus for fun! MY MISTAKE!!!!! and then break down in sobs and then retrench and outright refuse to budge on the grade. This would defeat the initial purpose of the plea.Claiming to need a certain grade conveniently ignores the fact that the grade is already likely the highest it can possibly be whilst still maintaining even the hint of professorial integrity, to keep up with the inflationary Joneses and stave off complaints. This sort of \"need\" language also moves the onus for meeting that need from the person earning the grade to the person assessing it. This transfer of power takes away the very agency and self-sufficiency students are allegedly attending college to gain. ( For now .)Most importantly, claiming to need a grade often gets in the way of legitimate professorial help. The pressure students are under to keep their grades up is real, and students deserve the benefit of the doubt, because so many are legitimately struggling . And so, any professor who gets a \"need-an-A\" message must immediately add to their substantial workload the job of crisis detective:Is Johnny\u2019s grade bad because he\u2019s trying his best and still underperforming?Or because he blew off a bunch of assignments and stopped coming to class?Wait, did he stop coming to class because of a crisis at home\u2014or because he\u2019s too busy doing kegstands with his bros at Sigma Kappa Douche?Wait, are those kegstands recreational, or a cry for help?working long hours; There are innumerable real problems that get in the way of student success: mental health struggles ; relatives with health issues; children PTSD due to military service or other causes. Students dealing with these problems deserve compassion. But it\u2019s difficult for professors to make these kinds of calls when every other Johnny \"needs\" a certain grade and acts like it\u2019s a matter of life and death.Believe it or not, if a student wants to get a higher grade, there are things she can do that work better than saying But I NEED a C-minus or I\u2019ll lose my sportsball eligibility!

The report, compiled by University of Indiana professor Brea Perry and University of Kentucky professor Edward Morris, concludes that high rates of suspensions can have a negative impact on the test scores of students who have not been suspended, and that schools may be better served by only suspending students in moderation.Evidence shows that high incarceration rates can have a devastating impact on offenders, as well as on surrounding families and communities. The researchers set out to see if a similar tactic would yield the same results in schools -\u2013 if high rates of suspension could negatively impact other students' academic achievement.To glean their results, researchers followed about 16,000 middle school and high school students in a Kentucky district over the course of six semesters. They tracked the students\u2019 scores on a statewide test administered three times a year, and compared it to their schools\u2019 suspension rates during the time of test taking. Researchers controlled for factors that are correlated with a school\u2019s suspension rate, like poverty. They also adjusted for factors like the annual number of drug infractions in a school, violent infractions and incidents of disruptive behavior, so that a school\u2019s normal level of crime would not confound \"the association between suspension and achievement,\" says the report.Perry told The Huffington Post the researchers adjusted for these factors so that \"any effect suspension has is over and above those events occurring. We wanted to find if something about the punishment itself ... is harmful to students above and beyond the disruption of being in a high violent context.\"Researchers found that high rates of school suspensions had a substantial negative impact on individual students' test scores \u2013- especially in schools with typically low levels of violence.\"Low and moderate levels of suspension are benign ... there is no benefit or harm,\" said Perry. But when the suspension levels become \"excessive,\" it starts to affect \"the achievement of non-suspended students.\"She continued, \"[Excessive suspension caused] negative consequences in all schools, but it was especially harmful when the level of violence in school is low. ... Suspension is most detrimental when it is probably perceived by students as illegitimate, overused or used inappropriate. Kids are looking around saying, \u2018This is happening way too often, things in school are great, and you\u2019re using suspension.\u2019\"According to the report, when a school with typically low levels of violence experiences high rates of suspension, \"the predicted percentile score in reading achievement decreases from about 54th at the mean level of suspension to 28th at very high levels of suspension.\" Overall, researchers conclude that high suspension rates \"can create a heightened sense of anxiety\" for students and that \"turnover of suspended students in and out of classrooms creates unstable, socially fragmented environments.\"Suspension rate disparities in the studied district mirrored national suspension disparities \u2013- meaning that African-American students were disproportionately suspended at the same rates reflected in national data.The research demonstrates that suspension should be used as a last resort, limited to situations where the safety of students is threatened, said Perry. She noted that a school used in the study recently implemented its own suspension diversion program, in which misbehaving students were asked to sit and do homework rather than being sent away. She says the school saw an increase in test scores.\"There\u2019s nothing good about [suspension] for suspended kids, but also nothing good about it for non-suspended kids,\" said Perry.", "answers": {"answer_start": [2002], "text": ["high rates of school suspensions"]}, "id": "555471041888534528"}, {"question": "She does the ice bucket challenge in a sheer white top, and look what\u2019s popping through", "context": "Las Vegas violinist Lydia Ansel does us all a favor here by deciding to take the ALS ice bucket challenge wearing a low-cut white tee.She apparently knows (and doesn\u2019t care) that this is the most transparent thing you could wear for the challenge, aside from nothing at all.We\u2019d prefer the latter, but a nice, thin white tee is almost as good.", "answers": {"answer_start": [10], "text": ["violinist Lydia Ansel"]}, "id": "4j21gp"}, {"question": "Britain won't be the first to leave a united Europe.

Greenlanders didn't want to join the European Economic Community, as the EU's forerunner was called.But Greenland was part of Denmark, and the Danes outvoted them in 1973 and joined the EEC. Six years later, Greenland won autonomy from Copenhagen.Greenland then held its own referendum on European membership in 1982. More than 12,000 Greenlanders voted to leave, versus just over 11,000 who voted to remain.So Greenland began exiting the EEC, though the process wasn't instantaneous.\"I remember that we did in the Legal Affairs Committee a report on the exit conditions of Greenland,\" Elting recalled.How long did it take?\"At least two years,\" he said.Greenland officially divorced from the EEC in 1985.There are actually a couple of other cases, including French Algeria. The Mediterranean coast of Algeria was considered an integral part of France and became part of the EEC along with France in 1957. However, after Algeria received independence from France in 1962, it left the EEC.Greenland, with a current population of around 56,000, does stand out by leaving the European grouping while remaining part of a country \u2014 Denmark \u2014 that has stayed in.Greenland's leaders have said consistently that they are satisfied with the decision to leave.In a 2013 interview with the BBC, then-Prime Minister Kuupik Kleist said, \"We have regular meetings with the [European] Parliament, and the European Union is one of our international partners \u2014 an important partner, and important for trade.\"\"But,\" he added, \"at the moment, there's no serious consideration for rejoining the European Union.\"To be fair to all those who say Britain would be the first country to leave the EU, that is technically true.Greenland was not, and is not, fully independent.

Here, he shows you the trick to getting the best dealOn Wednesday, I woke up in December 1973.Slade were singing \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" on the radio, Britain\u2019s role in Europe was being fiercely debated and industrial strife prevailed: Post Office workers were planning a walkout, and the Southern rail network was at a standstill due to a demarcation dispute about whether drivers or guards should operate the doors.While the Southern strike has elements that hark back to a year when the \"Beeching cuts\" were still ripping up the network, this week has also witnessed an important railway resurgence.On Monday, the first new rail link from a major city to London in a century opened. Chiltern Railways has paid \u00a3130m, and Network Rail \u00a3190m, to connect Oxford with Marylebone station in the capital. Passengers boarding in the university city may be perplexed to find themselves initially travelling north-east to Bicester, before a sharp right turn puts the train on the south-east trajectory to London. Partly because of this meander, Chilterns\u2019 services are not quite as quick as their Great Western Railway rivals that run from Oxford to Reading and Paddington. But they provide welcome competition to the existing trains \u2013 as well as the high-frequency buses that zip up and down the M40 between London and Oxford. The new link also provided the chance for Chiltern to make the fare structure on Britain\u2019s railways more sensible. An obvious consequence of the irrationality of rail fares is the practice of \"split ticketing\": when travellers like me who probably have too much time on our hands will seek to save money by buying two separate tickets for one journey. The best example is this: the Anytime Virgin Trains fare from Rugby to London is \u00a366. But choose a Virgin Train that stops en route in Milton Keynes, and buy one ticket for the first stage of the journey (\u00a313.90), a second for the remaining part (\u00a319.60), and you better than halve the cost of a peak-time trip to the capital.There is nothing illegal or underhand about this trick, so long as the train you catch is scheduled to pause at the Buckinghamshire new town. But it reveals one of many glaring absurdities built into the fares system.Five years ago, Sir Roy McNulty\u2019s report, Realising the Potential of GB Rail, complained about a fare structure \"which is complex, and often appears illogical\".Chiltern had a chance to apply logic and simplicity to its shiny new route, but chose not to. From London Marylebone to Oxford, an Anytime ticket costs \u00a330.60, an Off-Peak \u00a324.90. But buying split tickets with another Buckinghamshire town, High Wycombe, as the waypoint costs a maximum of \u00a322.60. That saves 10 per cent off-peak, and more than a quarter in rush hour.This week the rail minister, Paul Maynard, led an industry forum vowing \"to improve ticketing information for passengers and make it easier for people to choose the best-value fare for their journey\". There are some welcome improvements promised; for example, if you forget your railcard and end up having to pay full price (or, even worse, a penalty fare), your first offence will be forgiven and you will be able to claim back any additional expenses. But I fear the initiative will mainly involve tinkering at the edges of a fares system that is fundamentally flawed. Laudably, Mr Maynard says: \"Rail passengers must be able to trust that they are getting the best possible deal every time they travel.\" But the uncomfortable consequence of that promise is that Oxford-bound passengers at Marylebone must be told about the savings from split tickets \u2013 to the undoubted dismay of train operators, not to mention people stuck in the queue behind timewasters like me.In 1973, British Rail was just starting to experiment with off-peak train fares, beginning with \"Big City Savers\" between London and Scotland. By the time of privatisation, an elaborate pricing structure was in place. It was set in stone to dampen public anger against the sell-off.A generation on, this archaic system hobbles the market. Passengers, and the taxpayers who prop up the railways, deserve government and rail industry to end the timidity about tampering with fares.

Federal Election Commission that nonprofit groups could spend corporate funds on advertising close to an election that mentions a candidate, but does not call for their election or defeat. The ruling was a precursor to the 2010 Citizens United decision that openly freed corporations to spend money on elections.The 2007 ruling spurred the creation of nonprofits that accept corporate money and play a role in federal and state politics. In Montana, Western Tradition Partnership, a Colorado-based anti-environmental group, took center stage.Western Tradition Partnership (which would change its name to American Tradition Partnership in 2010) began spending money in Montana elections, largely in Republican primaries, in 2008 and continued to spend into the 2010 and 2012 campaigns.After complaints and investigations by public officials, a box of the group\u2019s stolen documents turned up in a meth house in Colorado. The documents, as reported by ProPublica and PBS\u2019s Frontline, revealed an extensive effort to illegally coordinate with candidates in Montana and Colorado elections.The revelation sparked an investigation in Montana, where the group was found to have violated election laws, and an outcry from politicians. The state legislature debated a bipartisan bill introduced by Republican state Sen. Jim Peterson to end dark money in state elections in 2013. That bill failed.After winning the 2012 gubernatorial election, Bullock made disclosure legislation a priority. He had fought with Western Tradition Partnership in his previous post as attorney general. The group had challenged the state\u2019s centuries-old ban on corporate money in elections after Citizens United opened the door to corporate electoral spending, and Bullock fought back.The state ban on corporate election spending was enacted after the mining magnates known as the \"Copper Kings\" spent freely from their corporate coffers to buy and sell political offices. Bullock argued that the state\u2019s unique history of corporate corruption should override the Supreme Court\u2019s determination in Citizens United. The top court in Montana agreed, but the Supreme Court sided with Western Tradition Partnership, ending the state\u2019s century-old ban on corporate political spending.In early 2015, Bullock teamed up with Republican state Sen. Duane Ankney to introduce Montana Disclose Act. The bill passed the Senate on the first try and went to the House, where a bipartisan majority of 41 Democrats and 10 Republicans passed it 51-48. The bill was sent to the governor\u2019s desk on Wednesday.The bill overcame opposition from the National Rifle Association and Americans for Prosperity, the main political vehicle of the billionaire Koch brothers.Montana is the second state, after California, to enact dark money disclosure laws.

Now couch potatoes can rejoice because a new study has found that just an hour of moderate activity a day wipes out all the negative impacts of sedentary behavior\u2014contrary to some prior studies claiming exercise didn\u2019t help much at all.\"Our message is a positive one,\" lead author Ulf Ekelund, of the Norwegian School of Sports Science and the University of Cambridge, said in a statement. \"It is possible to reduce, or even eliminate, these risks if we are active enough, even without having to take up sports or go to the gym.\"The study is part of a new four-paper series published today in The Lancet, along with several commentaries, timed to appear just before the start of the Olympic games. That\u2019s not a coincidence. It\u2019s a follow-up to a 2012 series in The Lancet declaring physical inactivity a \"global pandemic,\" and estimating that 5.3 million people die each year due to inactivity. The 2016 series examines how much progress has been made over the last four years to counter this. [You can listen to a full Lancet podcast about the whole series here.]Sitting for long periods\u2014as many of us do for work\u2014and binge-watching TV is the new smoking when it comes to human health risks. Over the last few years, there have been countless studies claiming links between our sedentary lifestyles and heart attacks, kidney diseases, chronic diseases, and colorectal cancer. Others warned that this behavior shortens our life expectancy and gives us mental health issues. And even for those who exercise regularly, a 2014 Mayo Clinic study found that every hour you sit reduces the gains of your daily workout by eight percent.If Silicon Valley\u2019s Richard Hendricks exercises a bit more, he might not die prematurely from so much sitting.Now for the good news: that last bit might not be true after all. Earlier this year, yet another study, this time by researchers from the University of Leicester, found that people who exercise regularly really do offset the unhealthy side effects of sitting all day. And the latest meta-analysis published today in The Lancet supports that conclusion.SponsoredGranted, an hour a day of moderate exercise is twice the amount of exercise recommended by the current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Even 30 minutes a day can be beneficial, but if you really want to offset all that sitting and binge-watching, the researchers agreed that you\u2019ll need to double that. This doesn\u2019t mean intense gym workouts or hardcore training for marathons. Anything that boosts your heart rate qualifies, including a nice brisk walk to work or leisurely bike ride.Bear in mind that this is a meta-analysis of prior research. According to Ekelund, he and his colleagues first combed through the existing scientific literature and picked out 13 studies relating to how much time people spend sitting and mortality (defined as premature death). Then they contacted the original authors and asked them all to reanalyze their data using the same parameters. This gave them a huge sample size: over 1 million subjects in all.Ekelund and his colleagues divided the subjects into four equal groups, based on their level of physical activity\u2014anywhere from less than 5 minutes a day, to an hour or more per day (60-70 minutes, on average). They found that those who were sedentary for eight hours a day, yet countered this with an hour of physical activity, had a much lower risk than those who maybe didn\u2019t sit for as long a period, but were not as physically active. That suggests it\u2019s not the sitting, it\u2019s the exercise that is the most relevant factor. (Needless to say, people who sat the most and exercised the least had the highest risk.)So what about binge-watching our favorite TV shows, which can be an even more passive activity than sitting at a computer typing? There have been a lot of hysterical headlines in recent years about how watching too much TV is totally going to kill you.GIF Is your TV binge-watching going to kill you? (Image: The Ring, 2002)There\u2019s some grounds for the concerns. A 2014 Spanish study found that if you\u2019re watching three or more hours per day, you\u2019re twice as likely to die in the next few years. Sitting in front of the TV has also been linked to higher risk of colon and lung cancers. Just this week, yet another study appeared warning about the dangers of excessive binge-watching\u2014this time showing an increased risk of dying from a blood clot in the lungs among the Japanese subjects.More good news: An hour of exercise a day also helps reduce this risk, according to Ekelund, although the beneficial impact is not quite as strong. He attributes the difference to what he calls \"residual confounding\"\u2014that is, other factors are likely influencing the outcome of the analysis. Some people might have a more unhealthy lifestyle overall, or perhaps we snack or drink more while watching TV, all of which could adversely impact our health.As for those who might protest that an hour a day of moderate exercise just isn\u2019t reasonable for very busy people, Ekelund pointed out in a London press conference earlier today that the average amount of time adults in the United Kingdom spend watching TV is 3 hours and 6 minutes. \"I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s too much to ask that maybe a little of those three hours be devoted to physical activity,\" he said.

This hearty stew is made of local veggies, salted meat and aromatic spices. It's a dish prepared cookout-style at social gatherings, where everyone brings something to put into the pot. Scott Neuman for NPRWhen describing the cultural history of the Caribbean island of Grenada, it's the cooking pot rather than the melting pot that springs to mind. And there's no better culinary metaphor than \"oil down,\" the peculiarly named national dish of Grenada, a mix of meats and vegetables.Nearly every ingredient in this hearty stew has a unique origin and story to tell: For instance, callaloo, a leafy vegetable somewhat similar in taste to spinach, and the same plant's root, known as dasheen, are indigenous to the Caribbean and were cultivated by Grenada's earliest Amerindian inhabitants.Beginning in the 16th century, bananas came from Asia via European explorers and settlers. A few centuries later, slaves from West Africa were brought here to work in the sugarcane fields, and with them came their tradition of one-pot meals.Pig snout and tails were scraps from the plantation master's house. Salted fish (originally cod) imported from Canada was meant as a cheap source of food for the slaves. So was breadfruit, that starchy, nutrient-packed fruit famously associated with the 1789 \"Mutiny on the Bounty.\" This South Pacific staple arrived in the Caribbean on a subsequent expedition led by the hapless Capt. William Bligh. Decades later, turmeric \u2014 known locally (and confusingly) as \"saffron\" \u2014 was introduced by South Asian immigrants, who themselves were meant to fill the labor vacuum left by emancipation in the 1830s.Although the island nation has been independent from Britain for barely four decades, most Grenadians are quick to note (with a hint of patriotism) that the me\u0301lange of colors in oil down are reflected in the country's flag \u2013 green for callaloo, red for carrots and gold for the curry-like hue of the turmeric.Enlarge this image Turmeric \u2014 known locally as saffron \u2014 is mixed into coconut milk and poured over meat in the oil down pot.

Scott Neuman for NPRToday, oil down \u2013 which gets its name from the layer of coconut oil and meat juices that settle to the bottom of the cooking pot \u2014 is a staple at the family table and at special gatherings, during the annual Carnival bacchanal or simply as a weekend feast.\"Oil down is a social thing,\" says Simeon Cornwall, a television producer who has researched the history of the dish for Grenada's National Museum. \"If you're cooking oil down, it's because you have a group of people gathering to eat.\"At such gatherings, everyone brings something to put in the pot, says Karen Hall, the owner of Patrick's Local Home Style Restaurant near the capital, St. George's. At home, it's usually a woman making oil down; however, much like a backyard barbecue in the United States, \"at a block party or a beach party, really whenever there's a bit of excitement, the men like to take over the cooking,\" Hall says with a grin.Even so, the matriarchal line is where the oil down meme gets transmitted. Esther Benoit, a chef at the Dodgy Dock restaurant on Grenada's south side, says for her, it's about the way her mother used to make it. \"Even today, as a professional cook, I am still influenced by how she made it,\" Benoit says. Some of her oldest memories of oil down the dish are about the sibling rivalry with her sister \"over which of us got the most dumplings,\" she says, referring to the dense balls of spindle-shaped dough that are a staple of many Caribbean soups and stews.The actual recipe for oil down, which can vary considerably from household to household, has \"evolved over time,\" notes Shirma Wells of the Grenada Tourism Authority. For example, today some Grenadians prefer to leave out the lesser parts of the pig, she says. \"Conch and crab are thrown in the pot in some families, and there's also a vegetarian version.\"Preparation, though, is not for the faint-of-heart. It takes a village, as demonstrated by a neighborhood gathering I recently attended in the Grenadian town of Belmont.It all begins with identifying ripe breadfruit and knocking it off the tree with a long stick, followed by lots of peeling, chopping and kneading of dumpling dough, culminating in the minimum one-hour of cooking time. It can take up most of a morning or afternoon. However, time isn't the only thing consumed: At the feast I witnessed, the whole process was fueled by liberal doses of high-octane white rum.Enlarge this image This steaming pot of oil down, with callaloo leaves on top, is ready to eat. Scott Neuman for NPR hide caption toggle caption Scott Neuman for NPR This steaming pot of oil down, with callaloo leaves on top, is ready to eat. Scott Neuman for NPRUnlike most stews, in which the ingredients get a thorough mixing during the cooking process, a pot of oil down is \"packed.\" Exactly how to \"pack the pot\" is a matter of taste and tradition, as well as a subject of occasional controversy. Everyone has a different order and method, but usually the breadfruit and meat goes on the bottom, most of the vegetables in the middle, and the callaloo leaves and dumplings on top. The ingredients simmer in situ.A few caveats about this dish: An American palate might be put off by the amount of starch. Oil down could also strike some as a bit salty, but eliminating the sodium-rich fish (or pre-soaking it) will likely rectify that.And unless you live in a town that has a well-stocked international grocery, you will probably have some difficulty finding callaloo and dasheen. For callaloo, you can substitute spinach and the dasheen can simply be left out \u2013 alterations that even many Grenadians will grudgingly approve. For breadfruit, yams or potatoes are a decent substitution. The bananas should be green.But still, what about that name that sounds more like a sports massage than a comfort food?\"When tourists see it on the menu, they always ask if it's something that has a lot of oil,\" restaurant owner Hall says with a laugh. \"I admit, it's a tough name.\"Oil DownThis recipe is a fairly simple version of oil down, This recipe is a fairly simple version of oil down, courtesy of the official website of the Government of Grenada.Ingredients8-10 young dasheen1 sprig celery, chive and thyme2 medium carrots chopped2 green peppers chopped1 lb. dumplings2 tsp. turmeric (saffron)1/2 lb.

Still, I\u2019ve never been able to recommend a Chromebook to somebody in the market for a full-fledged laptop.Chromebooks were designed primarily for use while connected to the internet. And, despite notable improvements over the years, Chromebooks are still highly dependent on a strong internet connection. What\u2019s more, the Chrome Web Store is a confusing mess, and any apps you do download only work in the Chrome browser.But I might start changing my tune about Chromebooks after Google\u2019s announcement that it\u2019s bringing Android apps and the Google Play Store to its laptops. That means Google's Chromebooks could now serve as a viable alternative to standard laptops.With Android apps like Microsoft\u2019s Office, you\u2019ll be able to create and edit Word documents, edit photos and listen to music you saved to your Spotify account without constantly needing to be connected to the web. And thanks to Google\u2019s new Android N operating system, apps will work in their own resizable windows rather than in Chrome browser tabs.That might not seem like a huge upgrade, but it will go a long way toward making your Chromebook feel like a true laptop.It also won\u2019t hurt that Google\u2019s Play Store will bring more than a million apps to Chrome OS. Sure, Chrome OS has its own apps store, but it's nowhere near as large as the Google Play Store. What's more, developers prioritize building apps for Android over Chrome OS, since there are more Android devices in the world. The Play Store is also simply more organized and easier to navigate than the Chrome store.But before you toss your MacBook or Windows laptop in the trash and rush to the store for a Chromebook, it\u2019s still worth pointing out that Google\u2019s notebooks have limitations.View photos Google is bringing Android apps to its Chrome OS. MoreFirst off, Chromebooks simply aren\u2019t meant to be as powerful as competing PCs and MacBooks. So, if you\u2019re going to be doing things like using high-end video and photo-editing software, you\u2019ll want to opt for a MacBook or PC. Ditto if you\u2019re into PC gaming.There's also the fact that certain Android apps might not offer the same kind of functionality as their OS X or Windows-based counterparts. On top of all of that, not all Chromebooks will run Android apps or the Google Play Store. (Still, Google says Chromebooks that can\u2019t run Android or the Play Store will still receive updates to the Chrome OS.)Those issues aside, Android\u2019s introduction to Chromebooks will likely put the fear of God in Microsoft and Apple \u2014 especially since Chromebook sales already outpaced MacBook sales for the first time even before the addition of Android.So should you buy a Chromebook now?Well, if the addition of Android apps and the Google Play Store go as planned, then absolutely. You'll get an incredible number of apps and offline capabilities that will make Chromebooks more useful than ever.If, however, you want a laptop with a lot of processing power, then you\u2019re still better off going with a Windows PC or MacBook.

But unlike drugs (which must get approval before they can be sold), cosmetics do not. As a result, companies that use or sell unsafe ingredients usually only get in trouble if they get caught.According to the FDA's website, it's up to individual companies, rather than the FDA, to ensure their products are safe. Compared to Canada and the European Union, both of whom have pretty strict oversight over cosmetics, the FDA has very few hard-and-fast rules.Here's what is still lurking in our cosmetics:LipstickThe makeup brand Lime Crime came under fire from the FDA in July for having color additives, the single ingredient the FDA does require approval for in cosmetics, in some of its products.\"Color is something that the FDA takes very seriously,\" said Robert Lochhead, a polymer science professor at the University of Southern Mississippi.Lochhead told Business Insider the reason the FDA is so concerned with color additives relative to other chemicals is part of the agency's history: In the 1950s, some of the color additives in food and other materials caused some serious health complications, namely FD&C Orange No. 1, which made many children sick after it was used in Halloween candy.There have also been problems with leads found in lipstick, which is troubling considering how easily ingestible lipstick is.Nail polishIn recent years, one of the most controversial chemicals in the cosmetic industry has been a chemical called phthalates. They're found in nail polish \u2014 that's what gives them that stretchy, plastic-y feeling \u2014 and perfumes.According to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, phthalates are a known environmental contaminant that could have an impact on human health, though they don't yet have enough conclusive evidence to say exactly how.Face washSome harmful substances in cosmetics aren't so much causing bodily harm as hurting the environment.Such is the case with plastic microbeads, which are found in a number of face washes and toothpastes. Microbeads were originally used because they're are a good way to exfoliate that don't generally cause rashes. Substituting the microbeads for nut shells, for example, would put a large portion of the population at risk for an allergic reaction.Eye makeupSome eye shadows may contain certain heavy metals, which can pose a problem if the metals are water soluble, meaning they could absorbed into the body through sweat.In a good spot, but still a ways to goAlthough they only \"prohibit or restrict,\"the use of 11 chemicals, the FDA still faces a lot of pressure to get things right, Karl Bygrave, the Director of Regulatory Affairs for cosmetics company Lush told Business Insider.\"It doesn't feel unregulated,\" he said.Bygrave said for its part, his company does its best to cater to consumer concerns about any potentially harmful chemicals in its products. While he says they only use compounds in their cosmetics that have been proven safe for people in tests, they will sometimes change the ingredients in their products based on consumer preference. In light of a study which suggested a link between preservatives called parabens and cancer (though ultimately no link was actually found), for example, the company opted to swap them out for different ingredients.That's just one company though \u2014 and others may not be as careful. As a way to combat the problems in the beauty industry, there seems to be an increased interest in organic beauty products over the last several years, especially in Europe and the US.

Surprisingly enough, it\u2019s one of his former competitors for the GOP nomination. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who recently stepped down from seeking the Republican presidential nomination, has had his share of verbal wars with Donald Trump. Now, however, it seems Christie is giving Trump his blessing and endorsing The Donald for president in 2016.Though the move seems surprising, it actually makes sense when taking into consideration that Trump is currently the GOP frontrunner. Despite concerns that Trump does not have any relevant political experience (or any experience at all), he has managed to keep the public and the media\u2019s attention long enough to make his voice heard. Word on the street is that if Donald does secure the GOP nomination (which seems likely), he will likely have a good chance of becoming President Trump.Trump has appealed to conservative audiences (and possibly even shocked some of them) with his ideas, the most prominent of which are a repeal of Obamacare and stricter immigration policies. An America with Trump for president would also have stricter foreign policies towards ISIS, as shown by the Vice.com article in which Trump promises to \"cut the head off of ISIS and steal their oil.\"The move is definitely surprising given that Christie and Trump were having a battle of wits not that long ago. As Mediaite noted, Christie had previously labelled Trump as a \"childish whiner.\" During the first GOP debate, Christie also slung mud at Trump and the other Republican candidates for not having a tangible plan to defeat or deal with ISIS.It seems some candidates are more content than others to acknowledge that Trump has a good chance at winning the GOP presidential nod. Marco Rubio and Trump continue to trade mocking words about one another\u2019s campaign, and their debating each other doesn\u2019t seem to be stopping.Trump has previously been attacked by his fellow conservative candidates for shading former GOP nominee John McCain and mocking the fact that McCain spent time in captivity during his service in the Korean War, stating \"I like people who don\u2019t get captured.\" It is indeed strange to see such a sudden reversal from Christie and several other important Republican candidates in their endorsement of Trump for president.\"The one person that Hillary and Bill Clinton do not want to see on that stage is...#DonaldTrump.\" \u2013 @ChrisChristiehttps://t.co/Tc7uSMuqRN \u2014 Fox News (@FoxNews) February 26, 2016Some on Twitter have pointed out their concerns about Christie\u2019s backing of Trump for president in 2016, with one tweet accusing Christie of having sold out every principle he had to support Trump.

That\u2019s what makes this partnership especially interesting, and also slightly unexpected.Trump and Christie do have some platitudes in common, though. Neither Christie, nor Trump, view abortion as a woman\u2019s right, for instance, and both want to loosen restrictions set in place by the EPA. Christie is okay with the current laws allowing same-sex marriage, however, whereas Trump is not and would likely change them if elected.Contrary to what is being said in the media, Christie does not necessarily need to change his viewpoints to support Trump for president.

Here are the scams you need to know aboutLast year the number of identity fraud cases rose to a record high. There were more than 172,900 recorded identity frauds in 2016 alone, according to new data from the fraud prevention service Cifas. That means that identity fraud is now well over half of all the fraud recorded by the organisation.Perhaps you assume that you won\u2019t fall victim because you can spot a dodgy email from a Nigerian prince who calls you \"beloved\" and wishes to transfer \u00a312.3m into your account as soon as you pay him a fee. However, it\u2019s the web-savvy digital natives who are increasingly falling for newer, more sophisticated scams. Almost 25,000 recorded victims of fraud were under the age of 30 and the number under the age of 21 rose by a third. Priya Sahib, spokesperson for the credit check company Experian, says the idea that you have to be foolish or careless to be caught out by fraudsters is wrong.\"That\u2019s certainly not the case, but by living our lives online we are making ourselves more vulnerable to fraud, especially younger people who are quicker to adopt new technologies rather than traditional methods of storing and tracking personal information,\" she explains. \"Experian\u2019s research has found that digitally-savvy users, older and retired households and elderly and transient renters are more susceptible to online fraud. However that doesn\u2019t mean other groups are not at risk.\"So no group can assume they are immune, no matter what their age or computing ability. Here are some of the smartest scams and how to spot and avoid them.Dead ringersOrganised crime groups who ring people in an attempt to steal sensitive data such as PINs are very good at what they do. The City of London\u2019s National Fraud Intelligence Bureau recently warned that fraudsters are now even using hold music similar to that used by the bank to make the call that little bit more convincing.Stephen Proffitt, deputy head of Action Fraud, says: \"If you receive a cold call purporting to be from your bank, always end the call as soon as possible and call your bank back using the number on the back of your bank card or statement and ask to be put through to the fraud team. Tell them exactly what has just occurred.\"Dodgy discountsMany of us are hooked on vouchers and discount codes, rely on them to bring down the cost of our shopping. But fraudsters understand that desperation makes us more easily fooled and they exploit that to steal sensitive data. Just this week Aldi was forced to warn customers that a hoax \u00a365 voucher was being circulated online. Customers had to hand over data to claim it but it was not accepted within the shop and clicking on the download infected their computers with malware and spyware.Just because your friends have shared it on social media it does not mean you can trust it.Fake protectionKeeping your computer protected by antivirus software is a sensible measure in the face of a rising tide of fraudsters. However, Action Fraud has recently warned that criminals are exploiting people who try to do just that.After buying new computers, victims who have struggled to launch their antivirus software have found themselves on fake antivirus websites. They enter contact information and are phoned by fraudsters who charge them for their subscription and even gain remote access to their machines. It\u2019s not just new computer owners; some victims have merely been trying to renew their subscriptions, so it\u2019s essential to stay vigilant. Tricky taxmanIt helps fraudsters if potential victims want to believe their lies and the tax rebate scam that\u2019s currently sweeping the UK is a prime example. Potential victims receive phishing emails and texts that claim to be from HMRC promising tax rebates. They are incredibly convincing and encourage recipients to download an attachment or click a link.Two things then happen. Either the computer is infected with banking malware that steals data and makes identity fraud possible, or it is infected with ransomware, which locks it up until a fraudster releases it. Of course criminals demand a ransom in order to do so. Boiler room fraudThere have been so many new types of investment in the past few years that it is understandable some people are more willing to trust new forms of money making scams \u2013 especially when returns on savings are so poor. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has warned people \u2013 and particularly the over-55s \u2013 to be careful and wary of investment opportunities such as wine investments. It says that fraudsters often offer lucrative returns way above the market rate and use flattery to make potential victims feel good and confident.Always check the FCA website to see if a firm or individual is authorised or if they are on the warning list and reject any unsolicited calls, letters and emails.Mark Steward, director of enforcement at the FCA, comments: \"Be alert to the warning signs like being contacted out of the blue, promises of low risk and/or guaranteed above market returns, special deals just for you, time pressure and, very often, flattery.\"Be vigilant. Don\u2019t let them push you into making a decision and parting with your money. Question their claims. Check the Financial Services Register and seek impartial advice. If in any doubt \u2013 don\u2019t invest.\"Staying safeThere\u2019s no point pretending that you can stay on top of fraud threats by checking out the latest scams; scammers move fast and are constantly coming up with new plans and strategies.Mike Haley, deputy chief executive of Cifas says: \"With nine out of ten identity frauds committed online and with all age groups at risk, we are urging everyone to make it more difficult for fraudsters to abuse their identity. There are three simple steps that anyone can take to protect themselves: use strong passwords, download software updates when prompted on your devices; and avoid using public wifi for banking and online shopping.\"We all remember to protect our possessions through locking our house or flat or car but we don\u2019t take the same care to protect our most important asset \u2013 our identities. We all need to take responsibility to secure our mail boxes, shred our important documents like bank statements and utility bills, and take sensible precautions online \u2013 otherwise we are making ourselves a target for the identity fraudster.\"Experian also recommends passcode-protecting mobile devices to avoid gifting thieves with information that makes it easier to steal identities, and checking the post for unexpected mail that could be a warning sign of ID fraud. It\u2019s also useful to regularly check your credit report in order to see when people have applied for credit in your name.But perhaps the most important way to stay safe from fraud is to remain vigilant. And that means acknowledging that just because you can spot a scam it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re safe from them all.Looking for credit card or current account deals?

( We discussed this very topic four years ago , but it\u2019s cool if you don\u2019t recall.) Many swimmers wear their goggles over one swim cap but under another; the lower swim cap can wrinkle and create drag. The lower cap is generally a latex material, which stays on the head better but wrinkles more, while the upper cap is a silicon material. In a sport where hundredths of a second matter, every tiny bit of drag can be the difference between a medal and a good-job, good-effort. A smooth surface atop the head is thus mandatory.Some swimmers still prefer to go with the single cap. And some, like Dana Vollmer in 2012, lose one along the way . The only rule is, as another famous aquatic talent once said: Just keep swimming.So now you\u2019re thinking, wait, if two caps on the head are better than one, wouldn\u2019t three be better than two?

When we narrow this down to just private-label foodstuffs sold in the US, it is still a whopping $80-billion-a-year opportunity (via data from the Private Label Manufacturers Association).In Europe, one in every three dollars spent in the consumer-packaged-goods market is on private-label content, Nielsen says.And Amazon's playbook when it comes to online retail is increasingly to see what works, then mimic it \u2014 but cheaper. Back in April, Bloomberg published a report on Amazon's practice of monitoring best-selling products on its platform \u2014 citing a laptop stand as an example \u2014 and then creating its own version of them at considerably lower price points, drawing customers away from the originals.The tech giant has been selling foodstuffs from other brands for a decade. That's a vast wealth of data to draw upon to figure out exactly what works and how the company can execute in a way that undercuts everyone else, leveraging the company's well-known indifference to profits.It's a risky business, however, with higher stakes than Amazon normally deals with. If your brand of USB cable doesn't work, customers get annoyed and buy a different one. If your brand of food gives someone salmonella, you risk long-term reputational damage. But the potential rewards have also never been higher.As shoppers increasingly turn to the web to do their weekly shopping, major supermarkets are beefing up their online grocery-ordering services. Loyalties are up for grabs as consumers make the transition \u2014 and Amazon, aiming to be a key beneficiary of this trend, reckons it's worth the gamble.", "answers": {"answer_start": [42], "text": ["food business"]}, "id": "1093444104031880_1098209923555298"}, {"question": "There\u2019s one little feature I want Apple to add to the next version of iOS", "context": "Apple\u2019s likely to unveil the next iteration of iOS very soon, which means it\u2019s just about time for everyone to get excited about everything new, then lament the features that haven\u2019t been added.This process is inevitable, so we might as well start the complaining early. As someone who's recently switched from a Nexus 5 to an iPhone SE, there\u2019s one Android-esque bit I particularly want from a potential iOS 10: a customizable Control Center.For the most part, the Control Center \u2014 that little settings menu you swipe up from the bottom of your display \u2014 is a good thing. Introduced with iOS 7, it\u2019s made it very easy to access commonly used functions. Three or four button presses become a swipe and a tap. This is something any OS that sells itself on \"simplicity\" should strive to do.The problem is one that\u2019s not unfamiliar to iPhone owners: a lack of user control.As it stands now, the functions you can access are limited to the handful Apple chooses itself. For me, it\u2019s not a stretch to call some of these expendable. I\u2019ll run through the lot of them now to explain what I mean.Airplane mode : There\u2019s only one instance in which I use Airplane mode, and that\u2019s on actual airplanes. Still, it can be useful if you\u2019re having a battery crisis or you just to go off the grid for a bit, so sure, whatever.WiFi : The old ball and chain. Essential.Bluetooth : Wireless headphones, speakers, wearables, and toothbrushes are enough of a thing that it has to be there.Do Not Disturb : There are certain situations where it\u2019s crucial for certain people. Personally, vibrate is enough, and nobody\u2019s calling at 1AM, so I usually pass.Orientation lock : If anything, this detracts from the user experience if you watch videos regularly. I\u2019ve read enough articles lying in bed to know it\u2019s annoying when the whole screen flips, but that\u2019s about it.Flashlight : I guess?: I guess? Timer : Everyone goes straight to the alarm clock.Night Shift : It\u2019s surprisingly effective \u2014 or at least it feels like it is \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to say it needs a spot.Calculator : It\u2019s good when your restaurant receipt doesn\u2019t have suggested tips on it already, but there are many other day-to-day use cases where people are in a rush to crunch numbers.Camera : Yes, definitely.Brightness slider : Auto-brightness and Night Shift make it a bit redundant, but those can be finicky, so it\u2019s fine.Music playback controls : For sure. Nobody wants to go in and out of Spotify every three minutes.AirDrop : Not the best if you use a Windows laptop or Android tablet.AirPlay : I prefer Roku .The point here isn\u2019t that half the Control Center is useless, but that everyone has their preferences. I try keep my cellular data off when I don\u2019t need it, for instance. I also have friends who use iMessage. When I\u2019m out, I usually wind up going against my inclinations, because I don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of unlocking the phone and repeatedly tapping through settings menus to get a text. This is annoying, and happens too often.It's a similar deal if you want to use, say, VPN, Personal Hotspot, or Location Services. Giving the option to swap these in, or at least expand the two rows of toggles there now, would seem to be a simple fix. Adding shortcuts to third-party apps would be even better, though that could open up issues in design (since Apple would need developers to make custom icons) and security (since you\u2019d be able to access personal data from the lock screen).Is something like this more for geeks than \"everyday\" people? Yeah. Would that make it any less useful? Nope. There are plenty other things for Apple to address with the next iOS \u2014 multi-user support, a better Siri, the ability to remove unused default apps \u2014 but I know I\u2019ll be happy so long as I don\u2019t have to look at a calculator icon again.EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT:25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Curious and brave, kids are constantly playing and exploring. It\u2019s part of growing up. But playtime that seems harmless can turn into something much more serious within seconds.Using laser pointers to play pretend rocket ships or make the family pet run back and forth looks like fun. But an eight-year-old boy\u2019s experience with laser pointers is proof of the serious damage they can cause. Johnny Marshall was at his sister\u2019s school fair when he saw a laser pen at one of the vendor booths. After some begging and pleading, his parents gave in and bought him the toy. Johnny was playing with his new toy at home when he shone it into his eyes out of curiosity \u2014 something that many children might do. Within a quarter of a second, he was left with a thermal burn and permanent damage to his retina.The FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health states that laser pointers with a 3-5 milliwatt range fall within the federal safety limit. Thus far, there have been no reports of eye damage among those lasers. However, there are plenty of lasers that go well above the federal safety limits, posing a risk for anyone who comes in contact with them.The United Kingdom has a different set of safety limits when it comes to laser pointers. \"... If it had been within the UK regulations, it wouldn\u2019t have done the damage,\" said Johnny\u2019s mother, Angela Marshall . \"But unfortunately, it had been imported, and therefore it was a class 3B laser, which is between 5 and 500 milliwatts.\" Class 3B lasers with a range of 5-500 milliwatts can cause damage to the eye within a fraction of a second, even from a distance. Serious eye damage can occur from up to 100 meters or about 328 feet away.While Johnny thankfully doesn\u2019t experience pain, 75% of his vision is gone, and he\u2019ll be limited to 25% of his sight for the rest of his life. If you are using a laser pointer, here are seven important safety tips to rememberDon\u2019t use laser pointers without labels \u2013 Imported lasers can be far more dangerous because they are higher-powered, and typically have no labels. Don\u2019t point laser beams at faces or eyes \u2013 Laser beams can damage the retinas. Never point a laser beam at anyone\u2019s face or eyes. Don\u2019t point laser pointers at an aircraft \u2013 Even a lower-powered laser pointer can travel up to 2.2 miles before fading out. Shining a pointer at an aircraft is extremely hazardous. Don\u2019t point laser pointers at automobiles \u2013 Laser pointers can cause temporary blindness or blind spots. Never point a laser anywhere near vehicles. Don\u2019t hold a laser beam on skin \u2013 A powerful laser pointer can be felt on the skin if held in place, causing a person to experience a burning sensation. Don\u2019t point lasers at animals \u2013 It\u2019s very easy to accidentally shine the beam into the animal\u2019s eyes, so never use a laser beam to \"play\" with animals.

Each team received $226.4 million as part of the split, most of which comes from the various television deals. The numbers come from the Green Bay Packers' annual financial report, via the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.If you're having trouble grasping the meaning of that massive amount of money, the NFL would qualify as one of the richest countries on the world, at least according to Wikipedia. Their numbers would put them somewhere in the 145 range. The league would rank somewhere around No. 50 overall when it comes to private companies as well, according to this list from Forbes.More comparisons to help put $7.24 billion in context:Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers makes an average annual salary of $22 million -- to put this into perspective, the Packers made just over 10 times that amount in national revenue alone.As the only NFL team publicly owned by fans, the Packers are required to release this financial information on a yearly basis. The numbers are up significantly from last year, in which roughly $6 billion was split between the teams. That's a pretty significant increase, which isn't surprising given the fact that new TV deals kicked in this past season.Those TV deals include new basic deals with CBS, NBC, Fox, ABC, ESPN and the NFL Network, including the Thursday Night Football package for CBS. That deal was worth $275 million, and has been renewed for 2015 at $300 million. It's possible these numbers will be even more massive next year, as DirecTV and the NFL agreed on a new deal for NFL Sunday Ticket, which kicks in this season.The national revenue sharing is up by a massive 120 percent over the last 11 years, according to Darren Rovell of ESPN. That also factors in inflation. To compare, for the 2012 season, teams received a $179.9 million slice of the pie. National revenue growth per team from 2005-10 was 16.2 percent, while from 2010-14 it grew a massive 136 percent. Needless to say, the TV deals are being awfully kind to the NFL these days.

He touched on a number of other abortion- and sex-related issues, arguing among other things that abortion rates have hurt the American economy. Smitherman's speech is posted at his campaign website and was reported by the Dallas Observer this week.Smitherman discussed the Chinese policy, saying that it has hurt that nation, and then compared it to the Old Testament narrative about the enslavement of the Hebrews in Egypt. He noted that in the Bible, after pharaoh orders the drowning of the first-born sons of the Hebrews, some years later Moses warns the pharaoh that \"10 plagues\" would come to Egypt, including the death of the first-born sons, if he does not release the Hebrews.\"Attempts at genocide, like pharaoh's, do not go without inevitable 'reckoning.' In the case of the Egyptians, all their first-born, including pharaoh's son, were killed, and once mighty Egypt became merely a footnote in human history and a place where we used to visit (but not anymore since the 'Arab spring') the pyramids,\" Smitherman said. \"In the case of China's one child policy, we have a modern-day example of what happens when a society does not honor 'life.' And like what happened to the Egyptians under pharaoh, this too, I predict, will end badly for the Chinese.\"He also cited a Chinese professor as saying that the one child policy will bring about \"Mother Nature's revenge.\"Smitherman, who has four children, encouraged people to have lots of children in order to help the U.S. economy. He also argued that society needs to give more to help those with many children, and called for tax breaks for large families. He said that abortion caused a loss of 80 million Americans, which has impacted the economy.\"At a time when our federal debt is almost $17 trillion, having another $82.5 mm [sic] people, hitting their stride in the work force, would help to reduce our per capita debt obligations, but most likely would also produce meaningful additional GDP to propel our economy and I bet they would vote Republican,\" he said, according to the transcript posted to his website.Smitherman told young men in the audience that they need to practice abstinence, but that they should be prepared to marry the woman if she becomes pregnant. But he encouraged them to marry at a young age in order to start having children.Smitherman made headlines earlier this year for retweeting a tweet from a self-described \"crazy writer\" that included a photo that depicted nooses around the necks of Republican U.S. senators who voted to open debate on a gun control bill.Smitherman was appointed to the Railroad Commission by Gov.

The Sig MCX, described by its manufacturer as a \"groundbreaking tactical rifle\" and \"the first true mission-adaptable weapon system,\" was introduced to the civilian market in 2015. Reviewing the gun for the website the Truth About Guns, Nick Leghorn led by noting that Sig Sauer \"developed the MCX rifle for America\u2019s special forces. Their goal: a firearm that\u2019s as quiet as an MP5, as deadly as an AK-47, and more modular than anything ever designed.\" In a review for Gun Digest, Drew Warden wrote that the MCX \"was built to be a compact and lightweight, close-quarters battle (CQB) suppressed rifle.\"In appearance and in spirit, the MCX is a battle weapon. In gun industry parlance, however, the MCX is a \"modern sporting rifle.\" So, too, are the AR-15\u2013style rifles\u2014manufactured by DPMS and Smith & Wesson, respectively\u2014that Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik used when they shot and killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in December; the Bushmaster AR-15\u2013style rifle used by Adam Lanza when he murdered 26 people in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012; and the Smith & Wesson AR-15 variant that James Holmes used, along with other weapons, to kill 12 in Aurora, Colorado, in July 2012. The term modern sporting rifle, evoking outdoorsy competition and good, clean fun, sounds incongruous when applied to weapons like these, unless you are prepared to argue that man is the most dangerous game. So what in the world is a modern sporting rifle? And why is the term used to refer to weapons such as the Sig MCX and the AR-15?Modern sporting rifle is a euphemism that the gun industry created in 2009 to describe modular semi-automatic rifles. The phrase is an artful attempt to recast weapons such as the MCX and the AR-15 (and its variants) as all-American toys. Never mind \"quiet and deadly\" and \"close-quarters battle\": Modern sporting rifle conjures up images of aristocrats riding with their hounds, vacationers knocking clays out of the sky, and ruddy-faced athletes enjoying their autumns in Carhartt jackets and mud-spattered ATVs. The term is a genius act of marketing, meant to bring these deadly weapons into the mainstream and keep them there. It\u2019s also disingenuous hokum that exists to cloud debate, like calling a used car \"pre-owned.\"The AR-15\u2013style rifle is the best-known modern sporting rifle. It has been around since the late 1950s, when the ArmaLite Corporation first developed the AR-15 as a civilian version of the M16 automatic rifle. (Today, the trademark for AR-15 is held by Colt. The term AR-15\u2013style rifle refers to the weapon\u2019s countless variants.) From 1994 to 2004, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban prohibited the sale of the Colt AR-15 and other AR-15 variants. When the ban expired, AR-15s went back on the U.S. market and have been a great boon to the firearms industry ever since.(It\u2019s important to note that the Sig MCX is not technically an AR-15 variant. The guts of the Sig MCX are different from those of the standard AR-15 platform\u2014Sean Utley at Tactical Life writes that the Sig MCX uses a gas piston system to cycle the action, whereas the standard AR-15 uses direct impingement. But the Sig MCX shares parts and design elements in common with AR-15\u2013style rifles. The two might not technically be related, but they are certainly neighbors, and both fall comfortably into the modern sporting rifle category.)While these weapons can indeed be used for hunting, no one actually needs a device that fires 45 rounds per minute to put down a deer.AR-15\u2013style rifles are popular with shooters because they are reliable, simple, cool-looking, and easily customized. (In its 2015 annual report, Remington Outdoor Company, the nation\u2019s leading manufacturer of modern sporting rifles, noted that sales of \"component systems and parts often [yield] higher margins than complete rifles.\") In 2012, I estimated that there were about 3.75 million AR-15\u2013style rifles in existence in the United States, and I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if that figure has tripled since then. Though some gunmakers have seen a recent decline in modern sporting rifle sales, in its 2015 annual report Remington reported that \"[m]arket demand for modern sporting rifles (\u2018MSR\u2019s) has seen growth in the opening price point segments,\" and noted that while its net firearms sales declined by 11 percent in 2015, sales of modern sporting rifles rose by $12.8 million. Remington attributed the overall decline in sales to, among other things, \"a soft hunting season\"\u2014which, logically, should have affected modern sporting rifle sales too, if said rifles are actually as prevalent among hunters, as industry types would claim.Restrictive gun laws do hurt sales, though. Starting in 2009, a Democratic president in the White House brought a renewed risk of legislation that might restrict or prohibit domestic sales of the AR-15 and its kin. That year, the National Shooting Sports Foundation\u2014a trade organization for the firearms industry\u2014coined the term modern sporting rifle as an exercise in pre-emptive tactical semantics: an attempt to reframe the debate around the AR-15, refuting those who would describe it and its siblings as assault weapons. The rebranding initiative was led by an industry executive named Randy Luth, who founded DPMS Firearms, a leading manufacturer of AR-style weapons. Luth was intent on marketing AR-15\u2013style rifles to hunters: In a 2009 article, Luth wrote that \"promoting the use of AR rifles for hunting\" was his \"obsession.\" Both Luth as a businessman and the NSSF as a trade organization have a vested interest in claiming that modular, militaristic semi-automatic rifles are perfect for hunting and sporting purposes. But while these weapons can indeed be used for hunting\u2014in a pinch, you can also use a pickup truck as a golf cart\u2014no one actually needs a device that fires 45 rounds per minute to put down a deer. Rather, the industrywide adoption of the modern sporting rifle terminology is plainly a diversionary tactic and a political ploy, to be used against anyone who dares to observe that modern sporting rifles are often the weapons of choice for America\u2019s mass shooters.Other weapons have factored into mass attacks, of course. Great damage can and has been done by psychopaths armed with handguns, shotguns, bolt-action rifles, and knives. But the modern sporting rifle pops up in mass shootings again and again, and it\u2019s not hard to understand why. These rifles can be relatively inexpensive and do not require any specialized training to use. They are lightweight and durable and can accommodate high-capacity magazines. The guns are built to resemble military-grade rifles and are often marketed to police departments and law enforcement agencies. In its annual report for the fiscal year ending on April 30, 2015, Smith & Wesson stated that its \"M&P branded modern sporting rifles are specifically designed to satisfy the functionality and reliability needs of global military, law enforcement, and security personnel.\" In 2012, reviewing the DPMS A-15\u2014one of the two AR-15 variants that would later be used by in the San Bernardino shootings\u2014for the Kit Up blog at Military.com, a reviewer noted, \"My ultimate goal was to get an M4 military style rifle like the type I carried in Iraq; the DPMS had those features and was affordable.\"Even some gun advocates have criticized the modern sporting rifle term as lame and unconvincing. In 2011, writing at the Gunmart blog, one progun blogger admitted that \"a big problem with the ineffectiveness of the phrase is that it just sounds like we are trying too hard when we use it. Its [sic] like we are almost acknowledging the fact that we are trying to game the debate and I believe it comes across as an obvious ploy.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [1683], "text": ["Modern sporting rifle"]}, "id": "743147944472346624"}, {"question": "Another Kickstarter campaign to bring back a beloved TV show just launched!", "context": "You're about to come down with a severe case of childhood nostalgia.PREVIOUSLY ...\"Reading Rainbow,\" the 1980s children's show that aired on PBS, was responsible for teaching literacy to millions of children across the country.

In recent months, cacao has transcended its already lofty status as a superfood and vaulted into the realm of party drugs. In this latest incarnation, cacao powder is taking the place of alcohol and illicit substances like Molly and ecstasy in parts of Western Europe. Lucid, a monthly cacao-fueled dance party in Berlin, fixes bitter Balinese cacao into partygoers\u2019 drinks. Morning Gloryville, a rise-and-shine rave company that organizes dance parties from London to New York, stocks its bar with cacao drinks and cacao pills.

First comes a surge of endorphins into your bloodstream, which increases acuity and fuels you with feelings of euphoria. Then there\u2019s the flood of magnesium, which relaxes your muscles and de-tenses your body. Raw cacao is also chock-full of flavanols that increase blood circulation and stimulate brain power, according to a recent study from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.And, of course, cacao can be downright delicious. Lucid\u2019s pixie-like party organizer, Ruby May, isn\u2019t a purist when it comes to the stuff: She spikes the 18 pounds of cacao per party with sweet hints of honey, agave syrup and cinnamon, and the celebrations go on for six hours. \"It\u2019s like a smooth, sensual hug in a cup,\" says the 36-year old.

The mood-boosting effects of cacao are \"subtle,\" she says, and it\u2019s not like tripping on acid. Even pure cacao is not actually a drug. While it does contain certain mood-enhancing compounds such as anandamide and phenylethylamine, the bitter reality is that the amount is much too low to have any direct influence on mood, says Dr. Catherine Kwik-Uribe, the director of research and development for Mars Symbioscience, a scientific division of Mars, Incorporated. Which is to say that all of this alleged chocoholism is probably a placebo effect.If it sounds like G-rated fun, well, it is; these are parties where virtue handily wins over vice.All of these concoctions come courtesy of the \"conscious dance movement,\" which evolved from an underground movement into morning raves and lunchtime dance parties, often attended by millennial office workers. It seeks to create a positive \u2014 and healthy \u2014 environment, in which participants can unhinge themselves from negative thoughts and social inhibitions. Alcohol is usually a no-no, as are illegal drugs. Self-actualization, communal bonding and calorie-burning are key. If it sounds like G-rated fun, well, it is; these are parties where virtue handily wins over vice. (Indeed, a kindergartner\u2019s birthday party, with ice cream and cake, hits more deadly sins than this.)But such events have found an audience. One of Lucid\u2019s attendees was 51-year-old Re\u0301ka Koma\u0301romi, an ethnobotanist based in Canterbury. She says the raves help her to overcome the sorrow of her daughter\u2019s untimely cancer \u2014 to \"get rid of the sadness\" and \"allow me to access my anger.\" Now that she\u2019s fully steeped into this scene, she can\u2019t get enough of cacao or its mellowing effects, especially for such \"psychologically hard\" times in her life.The use of cacao was pioneered in millennia past by Mesoamerican civilizations. As early as 1900 B.C., archaeologists believe, the Mokaya people in what is now Mexico were fermenting cacao beans into liquid chocolate. The Aztecs, it seems, valued cacao so highly they would trade the beans as a form of currency. Today, the very ethically conscious may have a beef with chocolate, protesting that appropriating cacao from its Mexican origins for Eurotrash-like dance parties rings a wee bit colonial.Skepticism aside, cacao can act as a \"catalyst for having more life,\" says May, rather than \"numbing ourselves with beer.\" And \"in all my years in research, I have never seen a person not smile when enjoying a piece of chocolate,\" adds Kwik-Uribe. Admittedly, she has a vested interest \u2014 but on the other hand, we can\u2019t imagine a party that can\u2019t be improved by chocolate.", "answers": {"answer_start": [405], "text": ["cacao"]}, "id": "4o1khv"}, {"question": "You'll never guess who Curt Schilling endorsed for president", "context": "Here are three big hints as to who former MLB star Curt Schilling has endorsed for president.1.

It's for the one candidate who, like Schilling, stands out for being outspoken and at times even controversial during the campaign.[Elsewhere: Jose Reyes suspended until May 31 for domestic violence arrest]If you guessed Donald Trump, you're correct.If you didn't guess Donald Trump, then we'll direct you to the nearly 1,500-word endorsement that was posted to Schilling's personal blog on Friday. It should help fill in the blanks.Here's the lead-in:I\u2019ve known Mr. Trump for a little over a decade. Our first encounter, and subsequent encounters, had to do with his request for me to appear on the apprentice.We spoke at length every time we got together.I realized very quickly this was a man decisive in action and confident in his ability.Schilling proceeds to explain the three biggest reasons why he's become a Trump supporter, which he insists are not skewed by his dislike for other candidates. Each is very detailed, leaving little room for questioning or back-pedaling. Schilling is steadfast in his support, though he's also consistent in his calling for Trump to show more leadership and more consistency during his campaigning.I do want Mr Trump to stop the name calling, I do want him to start being much more specific. But that\u2019s just me and my opinion. I love that he gets it. What do I mean by that? I mean if you heard his initial tax proposal and recently heard his talk around changing that, you understand unlike the liar in chief, he gets that what\u2019s going to happen is far too complicated to guarantee anything until you sit in the oval office. He won\u2019t pander, and that alone sets him apart from 99% of the corrupt entrenched old white gov\u2019t.Needless to say, Schilling shares a lot of strong opinions about current president Barack Obama and the state of the government.[Join a Yahoo Daily Fantasy Baseball contest now]With that in mind though, if you happened over to sportsbettingdime.com this week and placed a prop bet on Schilling becoming Trump's running mate, we suggest you not get too excited. The endorsment here was strong, but Schilling will have us know he doesn't need the job or the money.

The Saudi figure was first reported by Bloomberg News based on a Freedom of Information Act request.Unlike with most other major owners of U.S. debt, the Treasury Department kept Saudi Arabia's precise holdings secret since the 1970s. Saudi's holdings were lumped together with that of other oil exporting nations, including Venezuela and Iraq.But that policy ended on Monday as the Treasury Department disclosed precise holdings by specific countries that were previously grouped together. A Treasury official told CNNMoney the move was made following a review aimed at trying to provide more \"comprehensive and transparent\" data.The new Treasury report also revealed that the Cayman Islands, a country of less than 60,000 people, owned $265 billion of U.S. Treasuries as of March. That's the third-highest sum in the world and a reflection of the nation's status as a major tax haven. The Cayman Islands does not have a corporate tax, encouraging multinational companies to store vast sums of money there to avoid taxes.Likewise, Bermuda, another popular tax haven, is sitting on $63 billion of U.S. debt. Previously both the Cayman Islands and Bermuda were lumped together in a group of Caribbean banking center nations.It is possible that Saudi Arabia owns even more U.S. debt than what was revealed on Monday. That's because Saudi Arabia's central bank listed owning $587 billion of foreign reserves as of March. Typically, central banks park the majority of their foreign reserves in U.S. Treasuries. In other words, the numbers don't really add up.One possibility: Saudi Arabia could be taking a page out of China's playbook. Many analysts believe China owns U.S. debt through custodial accounts in Belgium, a relatively tiny country that listed owning over $154 billion of U.S. Treasuries as of March.The Saudi mystery had taken on greater significance in recent months. Since the end of 2014 the Saudis have burned through more than $130 billion of foreign-exchange reserves -- most likely including U.S. debt -- to help cope with the crash in oil prices. The Treasury Department said Saudi Arabia's U.S. debt holdings of $116.8 billion are down from $123.6 billion in January.Additionally, rising tensions between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia led the kingdom to make a recent shocking threat. Sources told CNN in April that Saudi Arabia threatened to sell off American assets if Congress passed a bill that would allow 9/11 victims to sue foreign governments. A Saudi source at the time told CNNMoney that the kingdom was \"serious\" about this threat.Dumping a vast sum of U.S. Treasuries at once could cause the securities to tank, potentially destabilizing global financial markets.

She is the host of the Slate Academy series the United States of Debt.As of Dec. 1, the law will require employers to pay the vast majority of salaried employees earning less than $47,476 annually overtime pay when they work more than 40 hours a week, double the current standard. As Vice President Joe Biden said when he announced the new regulations earlier this month, \"If you work overtime, you should actually get paid for working overtime.\"The administration estimates this will raise the pay of more than 4 million workers by $12 billion over the next decade. And if an employer doesn\u2019t want to pay the bill? Well, employees gain free time.Sounds great, right?Not, apparently, if you are a New York publishing insider. \"You want to bump into the boss at 8 o\u2019clock at night,\" Dan Reynolds, the chief executive of Workman Publishing and a man otherwise known as, uh, the boss, told Scheiber.Or a political activist.In a statement released shortly after the rules were announced, Andre Delattre, the executive director of the United States Public Interest Research Group, better known as US PIRG, a left-leaning consumer watchdog organization, whined, \"A person of means\u2014in service of a cause to which they feel deeply committed\u2014can volunteer to work for our organization for free for as many hours as they wish, but a person of lesser means\u2014who is no less committed to the work we do\u2014cannot agree to work for our organization for less than $47,476 without having their work hours strictly limited in order to keep our costs affordable.\"What\u2019s going on here?When the Obama administration first announced their intention to reform the overtime regulations two years ago, some of the most vehement protest came from employers of low-wage workers, like the fast food industry. And little wonder.While hourly workers are almost always eligible for overtime pay, salaried workers are not\u2014unless, that is, they earn less than the overtime threshold. When that amount was set at the current $23,660, there was an easy enough dodge. Give someone a managerial or professional title, and you were all but home free. While some companies\u2014Hi, Chipotle!\u2014have been sued by current and former employees who allege that their highfalutin\u2019 job descriptions did not match the reality of their less than impressive responsibilities, it seems all but certain the vast majority got away with the practice.The new rules are, of course, an attempt to do away with this rather disgraceful behavior. But raising the issue brought another uncomfortable truth to light. Employers in lower-prestige professions like fast food are not the only ones treating employees unfairly. Any number of higher-end, more prestigious industries were relying on the business model, too. Scheiber calls it \"The Devil Wears Prada economy,\" after the famed Lauren Weisberger novel, widely thought to be about her time working for Vogue\u2019s Anna Wintour.This is, of course, something of an established path for career advancement. You work long hours at your intro job\u2014like, say, editorial assistant, or political canvasser, or would-be Hollywood agent\u2014and try to take on extra duties as well, in the hopes the boss will notice you and promote you up.This model has its supporters, including Slate\u2019s Jordan Weissman, who wrote last year, \"while overtime functions pretty well when it's used to discourage companies from working vulnerable employees in low-skill positions to the bone, it's not necessarily appropriate in creative industries where educated young people are out to make a name for themselves and margins are thin.\"However, an argument could be made that by enabling this sort of behavior at the more prestigious ends of the labor market, we are making the practice more acceptable for everyone by normalizing it.Americans, somewhat famously, are a nation of workaholics. In 2014, a Gallup survey found that the average American claimed to be putting in 47 hours a week on the job. As I pointed out last year, most of us seem to think that\u2019s proper, or at least acceptable. We idealize Silicon Valley, where outsize workweeks are the norm.Yet this sort of time on the job is not exactly effective. Academic studies show that work performance deteriorates rapidly after someone puts in more than 50 hours a week. In fact, the drop-off point might even come after significantly fewer hours on the job. An Australian survey recently found that for people over the age of 40, performance began to decline after a mere 25 hours a week.Moreover, it\u2019s easy to suspect that the bosses claiming that their underlings are desperate to work long hours for low pay are telling themselves what they want to hear.A quick tour of Glass Door, a site for job listings and career advice, makes it clear that many of US PIRG\u2019s employees and former employees have a different take. \"Take better care of your employees. Invest in them. Give them the financial resources to have a live outside of work,\" one wrote the week after the new regulations were announced. \"With such a low pay and laborious workload, it\u2019s hard for people to make it a long-term job,\" a former canvasser claimed. \"Very long hours, high turnover, terrible work/life balance - employees are expected to devote almost all their time to their jobs (80+ hours a week),\" wrote a third.Liberals like to point fingers when people like presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claims, \"Wages are too high,\" because, as he put it a Republican debate last November, \"People have to go out, they have to work really hard and they have to get into that upper stratum.\" But as the US PIRG example reveals, it turned out they\u2014OK, we\u2014have something of a problem of our own.", "answers": {"answer_start": [198], "text": ["media and political elites"]}, "id": "505545482979561_516463305221112"}, {"question": "University moves to stop meningitis outbreak", "context": "SACRAMENTO, Calif., Jan 31 - Students at a California public university where meningococcal disease broke out in the fall will be offered a vaccine not approved for use in the United States, public health officials said on Friday.Officials in the most populous U.S. state had sought permission from the federal government to use the European vaccine, which inoculates against a strain of the disease that has struck four students at the University of California, Santa Barbara.The outbreak, which resulted in a student having his feet amputated, is similar to the one that struck eight students at Princeton University in New Jersey, where students won approval to use the same foreign vaccine in the fall.Bexsero, made by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG, is the only vaccine to protect against serotype B of the meningococcal bacteria, which can attack the nervous system as meningitis or cause a deadly blood condition.California health officials sought access to the vaccine for the Santa Barbara students in December amid renewed concern about meningococcal disease, which is highly contagious among people who live in close quarters, such as college students.Most strains of the bacteria can be controlled with a vaccine that is widely available in the United States.But Bexsero has not been submitted for approval for use in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Students at Princeton began receiving that vaccine after the CDC intervened on their behalf.

I browsed the web, used social networks, took a few photos, watched Netflix and YouTube, and listened to music. Nothing out of the ordinary: this is just how the phone works.The Xiaomi Mi Max has a 4850mAh non-removable battery and a 6.4\" 1080p LCD display, which should make it clear just how such battery life is achievable. A lower resolution, an efficient chipset (Snapdragon 652), and a ginormous lithium-ion pack - plus Android 6.0's doze mode for idle time - are a recipe for longevity.While it is understandable that a 1080p display may no longer be fashionable on a $700+ high-end smartphone today, what remains deeply mystifying to me is how most manufacturers seem to compromise on the size of batteries when battery life remains a massive pain point for most people, especially as their phones age. The fact that we may have access to chargers throughout the day or own external battery packs isn't an excuse: the entire reason we do these things is because smartphone batteries don't last long enough.

Especially considering cycle life causes batteries to degrade over time and phones tend not to be used in a vacuum of imaginary battery benchmarks (people install crappy, battery-draining apps, that's reality), every extra bit of battery we can jam into a smartphone should be on the table. An extra two or three millimeters of thickness for an extra couple hours off the charger is an acceptable compromise until batteries themselves get better, or smartphones become an order of magnitude more efficient.Sustainable battery life is a huge reason to hold on to a phone versus upgrade, too, particularly when batteries are no longer easily replaceable by the owner of the phone. Can you fit a 4850mAh battery into a 5\" smartphone while keeping it reasonably thin? Probably not. But given that we managed 3500mAh in one three years ago with an 8.5mm cross-section, I think we could do just a bit better than we are now.

The pay already was good and keeps getting better.The median total direct compensation for outside directors hit $263,500 last year, an increase of 3% from the prior year, according to an analysis of pay packages from the 500 largest companies by revenue released Tuesday by Willis Towers Watson, a global professional services firm.Not bad for a job that only requires an average of about eight meetings a year.Much of that pay comes from stock awards, a median of $150,000 to be exact. But in a new development, directors scored a median of $108,000 last year just in total cash payments. That's the first time the cash payment to directors has exceeded $100,000, and this piece of pay alone was up 6%. That $108,000 cash payment includes a median of $100,000 for a retainer, $2,000 for board meeting fees and other cash for being part of various committees. A fifth of companies increased their annual cash retainers last year.The increases in pay could be the result of more companies looking to get away from paying per-meeting fees to directors and paying \"more for value of contributions,\" says Robert Mustich, Willis Towers Watson's managing director of executive compensation for the East Coast.Many companies are making changes to their boards to boost retention of stock and to encourage directors to own stock. More than 90% of the companies studied require board members to own or retain company shares. To control \"excessive\" director compensation, more companies are putting annual limits on awards. Willis Towers Watson didn't release pay statistics on individual companies.But investors don't have to look far to find some cases where board members were paid well above the median of large companies.

But something else was going on.", "context": "To Deborah E. Savage, a trip to the doctor was frequently an exercise in humiliation.For more than 15 years, Savage's doctors doled out the same advice: You need to stop gaining weight. When Savage replied that she had tried watching her diet and exercising, only to pack on more pounds, it was clear they simply didn't believe her. Her family was equally skeptical.\"I would eat like my sister, and I would gain weight but she wouldn't,\" recalled Savage, a civil engineer who lives in Montgomery County and turns 31 next month.Savage's inexorable weight gain, which began in middle school and resulted in obesity, was not her only problem: For years, she also struggled with eruptions of painful acne and facial hair. \"These things made me feel ugly,\" she said.Last year, after Savage had trouble getting pregnant, an inability she suspected was linked to her irregular periods, she consulted a new obstetrician/gynecologist. The doctor suggested that Savage's constellation of problems might have a single cause. But it took a second OB/GYN to conduct the proper tests, which led to a definitive diagnosis of a common -- and consequential -- disorder.\"It's frustrating to me that so many doctors\" didn't think of this, she said. \"If I'd known, I would have made changes years ago.\"From the time she was 12, Savage recalled, her inability to lose weight became one of the defining elements of her life. And because she is short -- 5-foot-3 -- extra pounds were particularly noticeable. Her family's comparisons with her older, thinner sister rankled.At her mother's suggestion, Savage joined a gym, but that didn't help her lose more than a few pounds.Savage said she was too intimidated to ask her doctors why her weight didn't budge much, even when she faithfully followed a diet and worked out.Nor did she mention the other problems that plagued her. \"The facial hair thing was embarrassing, so I didn't want to talk about it,\" she recalled. \"Same with the acne. I felt so sensitive about it.\"Savage wasn't sure what to make of her irregular menstrual periods, but doctors did not seem concerned. At times she went three months without a period; at other times they lasted for two weeks. She managed to lose a little weight in college, but her acne and other problems persisted.What if men had periods?In her early 20s, Savage said, her gynecologist chided her about how heavy she was; every year, she seemed to gain 10 pounds. \"I explained that I had tried diet and exercise, but he said I was not trying hard enough,\" Savage recalled.To regulate her menstrual cycle and tame her acne, the doctor prescribed oral contraceptives, which helped clear her skin and made her periods somewhat less irregular.When she got married in 2010, Savage and her husband joined a popular weight-loss program to see whether they could motivate each other.Savage said she lost only about eight pounds after several months, while her husband, who followed the same diet, had no trouble shedding much more weight.\"It was very frustrating,\" she recalled. \"I was serious about following the rules, but it didn't pay off. I kind of gave up.\"By early 2015, she was desperate. She had stopped taking the pill nearly a year earlier, in hopes of getting pregnant; without it, her acne had roared back and her facial-hair problem had worsened. Savage was at her heaviest weight -- about 240 pounds -- and her family doctor warned that her cholesterol, at 210 mg/dL, was too high.In March, she switched gynecologists. Her new doctor zeroed in on her irregular periods and her weight and asked Savage whether she had heard of a metabolic disorder called polycystic ovarian (or ovary) syndrome.Savage replied that a friend in college had been diagnosed with PCOS. She was surprised when the doctor responded that she suspected Savage might have it, too.An explanation at lastPCOS is a common hormonal imbalance that often begins in puberty and affects as many as 10 percent of women. Its cause is unknown, but heredity appears to play a role: Women whose mothers or sisters have the disorder are at higher risk. Many women with PCOS have enlarged ovaries containing fluid-filled cysts that produce excess androgens -- male sex hormones, which interfere with ovulation. Other signs of PCOS include irregular, absent or prolonged periods, acne and excess facial and body hair, a condition known as hirsutism.Because it also disrupts the regulation of insulin, many women with PCOS are overweight or obese. The disorder, which can be controlled but not cured, also increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart attack.The gynecologist told Savage that she also suffered from PCOS. When Savage asked whether it was possible to test for the disorder, she said that the gynecologist told her, erroneously, that there were no tests. The best way to treat the problem was to lose weight, the doctor advised. And, the gynecologist added, she held weight-loss seminars in her office and urged Savage to sign up.Savage declined. Two weeks later, she consulted a third OB/GYN, Neil Horlick, who practices in Montgomery and Frederick counties.Horlick, after taking her history and performing an exam, said he suspected she had PCOS. When Savage told him she had been told there was no test for it, he assured her that testing was available and that he would order it.Because abnormalities of the thyroid or adrenal glands can cause similar symptoms, those must be ruled out first. PCOS is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion, made on the basis of blood tests, a patient's symptoms and an ultrasound of the ovaries.\"We generally look for two out of three criteria for PCOS,\" Horlick said. These include a history of irregular or absent periods, elevated levels of male hormones, particularly testosterone, and the presence of ovarian cysts. In Savage's case, an ultrasound showed no cysts, but she did have an elevated testosterone level.Horlick said he was surprised that Savage's condition went undiagnosed for so long. \"PCOS is always on our radar\" when a patient with irregular periods complains of weight gain and hirsutism, Horlick said.He told Savage that her best chance of getting pregnant involved losing weight. Horlick prescribed metformin, a diabetes drug that can promote weight loss. Metformin is commonly given to PCOS patients and may help promote ovulation as well.Savage decided to take a new approach to food. She began following a paleo diet, which emphasizes meat, vegetables, nuts and fruit, and drastically reduces the intake of carbohydrates, sugar and processed foods.The first month, she said, she was elated to discover that she had lost 15 pounds; between April and September, she shed 50 pounds and her cholesterol dropped 20 points. Her acne also improved, her level of testosterone dropped, and her menstrual cycle became more regular.Savage said she asked relatives whether anyone else had been diagnosed with PCOS. \"My parents had never heard of it,\" she said.In October 2015, she and her husband were elated to learn that she was pregnant with identical twin boys. Savage spent six weeks hospitalized at Maryland's Shady Grove Medical Center under close observation, because her twins have a rare condition in which they share a single amniotic sac and placenta, a condition unrelated to PCOS. The babies were born April 22.Savage said she hopes that her experience will spare other women from \"struggling for years the way I did.\"\"This isn't a bizarre disorder,\" she said. \"It shouldn't take [this many] doctors to find out, when I have a textbook case.\"Copyright Washington Post", "answers": {"answer_start": [3628], "text": ["polycystic ovarian (or ovary) syndrome"]}, "id": "505545482979561_516855285181914"}, {"question": "He Dug A Huge Hole In His Backyard, And What He Did With It Will Make You Green With Envy", "context": "When it comes to home projects, sometimes the fantasy is easier than reality. While we\u2019re sure most people have dreamed up some amazing renovations they\u2019d love to do, following through can be a whole other matter. Not only can home construction projects be expensive, but they come with legalities such as permits and paperwork that can really be a hassle. Plus, without professional help, it can be quite difficult times to execute a project well.Despite these caveats, one man named Wayne Martin was determined to complete one of the most ambitious backyard construction projects ever. At first, his neighbors thought he was completely bonkers when he began to dig a massive hole in his backyard, but their tune changed once the project was finished. In fact, his neighbors turned green with pure envy. We know you\u2019re going to feel the exact same way when you see the results of this ambitious, yet spectacular project.Wayne began by purchasing a 20-foot shipping container that he found online. While you would think this would be expensive, many of these types of containers are discarded and sold for cheap. When doing your own construction project it\u2019s important to keep costs down, so this project is already off to a great start!The shipping container would end up the body for the entire project, so Wayne was lucky to find it at such a low cost! Without it, he\u2019d be up a creek without a paddle! The big question on our minds is what is he going to use it for?The next step in the construction process was to seal off one end of the shipping container so nothing could get in. On the other end of the container, Wayne installed a front door that would be the only entrance inside. What is this guy up to? We have our theories.With the container sealed and ready, Wayne moved on to dig a large hole in his backyard. He made sure the hole was at least two feet deeper than the height of the container so he would have room for steps later in the construction process. A six-inch layer of gravel was also poured along the bottom of the hole to provide an even foundation for the shipping container.Due to the size of the shipping container, Wayne had to hire a septic company to bring in their truck and crane to move the container into the hole. Can you guess what this project is? Wait until you see the end result! We can\u2019t believe that Wayne isn\u2019t a professional!After the container was lowered into the hole, Wayne needed to make sure there was 2-feet of space around each side so he could still perform the work needed to be done to the outside and inside of the container. By now, we\u2019re sure you\u2019ve guessed what Wayne is makinghowever, you\u2019ll have to wait just a bit longer to know for sure!Next, a sump pump was installed to make sure the container remained above the water line. These are usually found in basements and ensures water doesn\u2019t eventually collect and flood an underground structure. Wayne wanted to be sure his project didn\u2019t end up waterlogged one day. Good thinking!Concrete steps leading down to the container\u2019s door were built so the container could be accessed easily. While this obvious underground bunker isn\u2019t super high-tech or fancy, you can definitely tell it\u2019s going to get the job done! Now, with most of the exterior work done, there were still a few items left to be completed. Wayne is definitely on a construction roll!One of the next pieces of this elaborate underground construction puzzle was installing two I-beams along the top that would stay level with the stairs. This framework would offer up support for what comes later. Wayne is certainly keeping safety a top priority. We can\u2019t wait to see what comes next!Who knew Wayne was so efficient with a jackhammer? Go, Wayne, go! The next steps involved building a framework along the roof of the shipping container. Can you see what\u2019s coming together? It definitely is an underground bunker of some sort. To say we are excited to see the finished product is a bit of an understatement.Now that the framework was in place, Wayne began to lay down sheets of corrugated metal that would be stable enough to support an average human\u2019s weight. The last thing anyone would want is someone falling through the ground and landing on top of the bunker. Wait, did we say bunker? Ignore that! We don\u2019t know what this is going to end up being yet!With the foundation and roof finally in place, Wayne left an opening over the stairs, utilizing rebar to provide extra support. It was now time to focus on the entryway and as you can see, things are finally starting to come together on this project. We\u2019re amazed ONE MAN was able to do so much!Cinder blocks were placed around the rebar and filled in with cement. It was important that the entrance was not only sturdy, but was raised above the actual container. Weather was also a factor, so Wayne took great care to ensure his project would be protected from the natural elements.As the project neared its end, Wayne installed two 12-inch air vents at the front and back end of the container in order to provide the interior with fresh air. He also made sure to install some PVC pipe for the eventual installation of utilities. It seems good \u2018ole Wayne has thought of everything!With all of the basics in place, it was finally time to pour in the concrete to fill in all of the gaps. A six-inch layer of concrete was used to reinforce the corrugated metal roofing, as well as the rebar around the entryway. It seems Wayne definitely wanted this underground structure to withstand the test of time!Once the layers of concrete were dry, Wayne added more cinder blocks around the entrance. There would be no cutting corners when it came to reinforcements, as well as the structure\u2019s safety. It seems we are close to the light at the end of the tunnel.Wayne removed the temporary supports underneath the concrete and metal sheeting to test the structural integrity. This is an excellent view of the progress being made. Can you believe this used to just be a hole in the ground?Now, we\u2019re sure you\u2019ve guessed by now that Wayne is building his very own underground bunker! As you can see, Wayne wasted no time in filling it with wine and liquor. While we thought this was going to be a disaster shelter, a wine cellar works too!Here\u2019s another angle of the interior. While it\u2019s currently functioning for storage, this would definitely be a great place to escape a natural disaster or a nuclear attack. You\u2019d also feel pretty good too with all that alcohol down there.It\u2019s important to point out that these types of shipping containers are designed to be stacked, which means most of the structural integrity is within each corner of the container. You need to be careful if you decide to make your own underground bunker that you build in the correct support so the container doesn\u2019t buckle under the weight.Of course, other people have attempted to construct underground shelters in their backyards, and you don\u2019t have to use a shipping container to do so. As you can see, this person decided to make their structure from cinder blocks.So when can we move in? This bunker looks so upscale and elegant. Heck, it looks better than some of apartment\u2019s we\u2019ve seen. Could we fill out a rental application?Most underground bunkers are inspired by science fiction films, where people escape to large underground shelters to avoid extinction. It\u2019s important to understand that these bunkers are simply that\u2014fiction. Most underground bunkers are much smaller and only contain the basics when it comes amenities. As for Wayne? He simply wanted a place to store his stock pile of wine.", "answers": {"answer_start": [6084], "text": ["own underground bunker!"]}, "id": "4m7ole"}, {"question": "Best Buy Has An Insane Xbox One Deal For A Limited Time, Get The Details", "context": "Best Buy Has An Insane Xbox One Deal For A Limited Time, Get The Details By William UsherThose aren't the only two versions discounted, though.
