Is there such a thing as too much? And what if you got a discount on the service? But knowing how much to tip your hairdresser has to be one of the more confusing tip scenarios out there, especially if you get your hair done at a salon where more than one person works on your strands.Below, once and for all, is a definitive guide to tipping your hairstylist \u2014 and their assistant, shampooist, and everyone in between. Thank us later \u2014 no tip necessary.If you need a simple baseline, experts agree that tipping 20% is standard and acceptable at any hair salon. If you\u2019re in a smaller town, 15% may be the norm. You can always ask the receptionist at your salon what\u2019s typical, or ask on the phone when you call to make your appointment.Offering the person who shampoos your hair $3 to $5 is a nice gesture. You can hand the money directly to the shampooist, or give it to the receptionist when you check out and ask them to pass it along.As for your stylist\u2019s assistant, that person is likely in training and may not be making much money, so Michelle Lee, master designer and manager at Salon Eva Michelle in Boston, recommends tipping them between $5 and $20.\"All the assistants are there in training to be stylists, and at many places, a lot are working at minimum wage, so anywhere from $5 to $20 is fine depending on how much they end up doing for the client, or if they have been especially gracious to you,\" she told InStyle.Try to bring cash to tip, if possible. Not every credit card machine will allow you to add a tip, and using cash will make it easier to tip the different people who worked on your mane. And yes, it\u2019s OK to tip even if your hairdresser is the owner of the salon.Also, if your salon offers free bang touch-ups, consider bringing a few dollars to leave as a thank-you gesture. Your stylist will look fondly on you next time you come into the salon.If you\u2019re a woman with shorter hair \u2014 meaning you get it cut and/or colored regularly \u2014 your stylists will understand if you offer a slightly smaller tip. After all, your annual bill is much higher than a longer-haired client\u2019s.As for tipping on a discounted service: Stylists are split on the issue, with some suggesting a 20% tip on the original price of the service, and others saying a tip of 20% on the discounted rate is fine, since the goal is to get you back into the salon. When in doubt, ask at the front desk!Finally, if you\u2019re unsatisfied with your haircut, communicated what you wanted to your stylist, and talked to them about how to fix it but they refused to make changes, you can definitely lower your tip. If they invite you back for a fix-up cut, though, etiquette expert Peggy Post suggests offering a tip of 15-20%.", "answers": {"answer_start": [669], "text": ["20%"]}, "id": "857559227384160256"}, {"question": "This popular soda could cure your hangovers scientists say:", "context": "Most of us are familiar with the pounding headaches, drowsiness, stomach-turning nausea and \"did-I-get-run-over-by-a-bus\" sensation that comes with that most dreaded of morning-after ailments: the hangover.To alleviate the suffering, chugging coffee, downing Advil or simply choosing to forego the wretched day altogether by returning to bed sometimes does the trick. But what if there were a miracle elixir that could chase that hangover cloud away -- and better still, what if that magic drink were something you could easily pick up at your local supermarket?A group of Chinese researchers say that they may have indeed found this perfect hangover cure -- and it goes by the name of \"Sprite.\"After examining 57 beverages in a lab, researcher Hua-Bin Li and his colleagues at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou determined that Sprite was one of the drinks that best relieved hangover symptoms.The team of scientists had hypothesized that what you consume after drinking booze could alter the effect of alcohol on your body. Specifically, they theorized that certain drinks could impact the body's metabolism of alcohol in a way that would help alleviate hangover symptoms.Chemistry World explains it this way:Some of the adverse effects of alcohol are thought to be caused, not by the ethanol itself, but by ethanol\u2019s first metabolite, acetaldehyde. Ethanol is metabolized into acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and then into acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Unlike acetaldehyde, acetate is innocuous and may even be responsible for some of the positive health benefits of alcohol consumption. Therefore the key to reducing alcohol-related damage lies in minimizing the amount of time acetaldehyde is present in the body.The Chinese researchers, therefore, decided that they would look at how the different beverages impacted the activity of ADH and ALDH.Some beverages were found to be terrible for a hangover. An herbal infusion with hemp seeds, for example, was discovered to boost the activity of ADH while inhibiting ALDH, therefore slowing down the breakdown of acetaldehyde and dragging out the hangover effects.On the other hand, some drinks, including Sprite (known in China as Xue bi) and a type of soda water, were found to have the opposite effect: increasing the activity of ALDH and thus speeding up the breakdown of acetaldehyde.The researchers are reportedly planning to conduct the tests in living organisms, but the results have already generated a lot of buzz, as people around the world celebrate the possible death of the hangover. However, experts warn that we shouldn't quite raise the victory flag just yet.Edzard Ernst, a medicinal science expert from the University of Exeter, told Chemistry World that while he found the study interesting, more research is necessary before we wholeheartedly embrace the results.Do you have a tried-and-tested hangover cure that you swear by?

But what was in the insecticide, and how does it work?The main ingredient of the insecticide, Dibrom, is the chemical naled. It works by killing mosquitoes on contact. Sprayers produce very fine droplets that are small enough to stay airborne and intercept mosquitoes in flight.Naled does not pose a health risk to either people or pets when sprayed in low concentrations, according to both the Environmental Protection Agency (PDF) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.However, in its own review of naled, the European Union came to a different conclusion. Naled degrades to dichlorvos , a toxic chemical, in the presence of sunlight, and according to the EU scientific commission , this can cause genetic mutations. As a result, the EU has banned agricultural use of products containing naled.In Puerto Rico, where a public health emergency has been declared due to the sheer number of cases of Zika, recommendations from the CDC and the EPA to use aerial spraying to control the mosquito population there have been stymied by protests. Activists organized a June 28 demonstration outside the San Juan CDC and raised concerns about the consequences for human health and their environment.By contrast, in Miami-Dade County, the Department of Solid Waste Management's Mosquito Control Section commonly sprays in response to state Department of Health investigations -- and when residents request the use of insecticide.The Mosquito Control Section has applied naled via an ultra-low-volume spray for many years, officials said in a news release. In fact, Dibrom has been used in the United States over the past 50 years, said Timothy J. Donnelly, vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel of AMVAC Chemical Corp ., which makes the insecticide.\"It is regularly sprayed in 12 states on over 15 million acres each year,\" Donnelly said.Since the variety of mosquito that carries Zika is most active predawn and at sunset, all spraying must take place at those times. Special precautions are not necessary, Miami-Dade County officials advised, though people with allergies may want to remain indoors. During any insecticide operation, it is recommended that beekeepers cover their bees.Aerial spraying, which lasts about an hour, was recommended by the CDC and Florida's Department of Health to reduce the population of adult mosquitoes, some of which may be capable of spreading viruses, including Zika. Originally scheduled for Wednesday, the aerial spraying operation was delayed because of poor weather conditions.\"When Naled gets sprayed, it knocks out the mosquitoes, but if sprayed over water, it breaks down quickly,\" said Bryn Phillips, a specialist in the University of California, Davis environmental toxicology department.His research indicates that the insecticide breaks down into different chemical versions of Naled. One of these versions, dichlorvos, is quite toxic to aquatic species at the \"low end of the food chain,\" like aquatic insects and frog larvae -- \"basically fish food,\" Phillips said.If the chemicals are rotated and managed properly, an environmental area can recover, Phillips noted.Naled spray droplets stay airborne for an extended period, and the chemical begins to break down once exposed to sunlight or water. Very little of the low-concentration spray settles on the ground. Those who worry that they may have come into contact with the chemicals should wash, county officials advised; any food that may have been exposed should be rinsed before eating. Since concentrations are far below what is harmful to humans, symptoms, such as skin irritation or headache, are unlikely.Miami-Dade County's aerial spraying alternates between naled and an insecticide called BTI (bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, a naturally occurring bacterium), which targets mosquito larvae instead of adult mosquitoes. BTI has been registered with the EPA since 1961 as a pesticide.Zika was discovered in 1947 in Uganda. An outbreak that began in Brazil in 2015 has spread throughout the Americas. Florida reported the nation's first local transmission of Zika from an infected mosquito in late July.Zika has been shown to be responsible for an alarming increase in microcephaly, in which babies are born with small brains and heads, as well as other hearing, vision and developmental disorders.Although spraying insecticides raises concerns about toxicity to aquatic life, policy-makers must weigh the potential costs to human health by not spraying and costs to environmental health by spraying, Phillips said.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\"You talk to the mosquito spraying guys, and they're all about human health, and they're OK with some impacts to the environment,\" he said.

Well maybe now we\u2019ve sparked your curiosity.They don\u2019t fart\u2014detectably. There\u2019s no reason to believe that birds are somehow exempt from passing gas, but it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone has ever truly observed\u2014or more importantly, measured\u2014a bird fart. But between ornithologists, veterinarians, and amateur bird watchers, how is it possible no one has ever seen the feathered creatures flatulate?As Monterey Bay Aquarium veterinarian Mike Murray said in a 2009 article for Popular Science, birds are capable of passing gas, but they don\u2019t because they lack the same combination of diet and gas-forming bacteria in their gut that gives mammals their odorous gas. Murray added that if he spotted gas in an x-ray of a bird\u2019s gastrointestinal tract, he\u2019d be concerned something was wrong with the bird.But Laura Eriksen, a birder, educator, and blogger at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has a different theory. In a blog post on her website, she posits that birds have much shorter digestive tracts than mammals, so there\u2019s less time for gas to build up, allowing farts to slip by undetected.In another blog post, she describes the only written account she\u2019s aware of describing a possible bird fart. It comes from former Cornell student Alan Richard Weisbrod, in his 1965 master\u2019s thesis on blue jays.One of the birds in front of me defecated. A small puff of whitish gas was expelled along with the feces. The feces dropped from the bird while the gas wafted below and parallel to the slightly raised tail, until it dissipated rapidly into the cold air. The gas could be clearly seen against the dark-colored eave that hangs over the sheltered perches, upon which the birds were fluffed and resting. Several days later a bird perched in the same position was observed to defecate with the accompanying wisp of whitish gas.Weisbrod goes on to describe how birds eat similar diets to many mammals who definitely flatulate but explains that he could not find any other accounts of bird flatulence at that time. (And apparently no scientist has stepped up to the plate to follow up on Weisbrod\u2019s observation.) He also acknowledges that the \"wisp of whitish gas\" could also have simply been water vapor\u2014steam rising from the feces. (Just think of how your dog\u2019s poop steams in the cold when you take him out for his daily business in the winter.)It\u2019s a little difficult to know for sure that birds rarely or never fart. According to Mental_Floss, human farts are smelly due to a combination of our diets and the microbes in our guts that help digest the foods in our diets. A video by AsapSCIENCE adds that \"the longer the food stays in the gut, the more time it has to ferment\" and break down into its smellier components\u2014namely sulfur. So if birds don\u2019t have the right food-microbe combo and intestinal length to produce smelly gas, then we wouldn\u2019t smell it.Without a smell, bird farts rustle no one\u2019s feathers.But even if birds produced immaculate, odorless gas, would we hear it? That is less clear. According to a Q&A with proctologist Lester Gottesman in VICE, farts make a sound due to the composition of gas and the shape (read: tightness) of the sphincter. A lot of the gas that makes up a fart, Gottesman said, is swallowed air. And a lot of swallowed air leads to a lot of gas, which can make a bigger, beefier noise. But how much air does a swallow swallow when a swallow swallows air?As far as we could tell, this isn\u2019t a question any scientist has specifically tried to measure. But the Daily Dot reached out to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for answers nonetheless. According to an ornithologist there, relayed via email by the lab\u2019s good-humored press officer Miyoko Chu, birds definitely swallow air. But he thinks they expel it via burping rather than farting. He added that he thinks birds do fart \"in some cases and would depend on what species, their diet, and whether it is observable.\" He also said that he\u2019s never personally noticed a bird fart.Lastly, maybe they do swallow enough air that would leave most animals saying \"excuse me\" after a butt-bellow, but perhaps something about the construction of the, erm, exit point keeps it from making a sound. This is pure speculation, but maybe something about having feathers around the bird\u2019s cloaca (its all-purpose back-end chute) helps the fart slip by unnoticed. And without a smell, bird farts rustle no one\u2019s feathers.", "answers": {"answer_start": [89], "text": ["They don\u2019t fart"]}, "id": "1100188040002123_1123063127714614"}, {"question": "The one morning work mistake you can't recover from", "context": "Rolling into the office around 9:30 a.m. every day may be killing your career, even if you stay late to put in a full day's worth of work.A new study from the University of Washington\u2019s Foster School of Business found that despite working the same amount of time, a worker who starts the day earlier will come off as more conscientious, and consequently receive better performance reviews, than someone who starts later.Past studies have shown that giving workers a little leeway in setting their hours makes them happier and more productive -- presumably a win for both the employee and the company. That's why companies like Google and Microsoft let employees work from home or adjust their schedules to account for personal responsibilities, like taking a child to school in the morning.But the study suggests a downside: Your boss may be unconsciously judging you for giving yourself a later start time, regardless of how much work you're getting done.In the study, which will be published in full in the Journal of Applied Psychology later this year, researchers asked 149 supervisors to rate an employee\u2019s performance; employee start times ranged from 5 a.m. to 9:45 a.m. Even when employees who started later in the day worked the same number of hours as those who started earlier, supervisors were inclined to rate employees who began work earlier as more conscientious, and gave them higher performance ratings.Bosses who preferred to work later hours themselves were less inclined to display this \"morning bias.\"In a second experiment, the researchers assigned a group of 141 college students the role of a supervisor, and asked each student to review a profile of a fictitious employee. The performance of the fictional employee was the same in all cases, but start time varied across profiles. Researchers found that employees who worked from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. were consistently given higher ratings of conscientiousness and performance by the student supervisors than employees who worked from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.The researchers concluded that employees who can opt for flexible work schedules should shift their schedules earlier, not later, to account for managers' morning bias.\"It seems likely that some employees are experiencing a decrement in their performance ratings that is not based on anything having to do with their actual performance,\" the three researchers wrote in a post for the Harvard Business Review.This \"morning bias\" appears to be deeply ingrained. In a word-association experiment designed to test the implicit stereotype that early risers are more diligent workers, the researchers also found that a majority of the 120 working adults surveyed linked words associated with the morning (like \"sunrise\") with words associated with conscientiousness (like \"industriousness\").Another recent study covered by the New York Times further suggests there may be an implicit view among some managers that employees who take advantage of flexible work policies in any way are less conscientious than employees who work more \"traditional\" hours.\"Most organizations still treat workplace flexibility as an accommodation,\" Erin Kelly, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota, told the Times. \"You are implicitly saying, \u2018Most of us will be working these traditional ways and the rewards will come to those working these traditional ways.\u2019 And that is where you have this stigma or career penalties.\"Although the study did not consider gender, it seems women could be more adversely affected by morning biases than men. That's because more women than men are primary caregivers for their children and assume a disproportionate amount of household tasks, according to a 2013 Bureau of Labor Statistics report. Studies have shown that women take advantage of workplace telecommuting policies more often than men for the same reason -- and that their careers may suffer as a result of not logging as much face time at the office.", "answers": {"answer_start": [407], "text": ["starts later"]}, "id": "473452702002065409"}, {"question": "Apple iOS 9.3.2 Has A Nasty Surprise", "context": "Today released iOS 9.3.2.

But beware, just hours after launch, it turns out iOS 9.3.2 is hiding a very nasty surprise indeed...Apple iOS 9.3.2 is bricking iPad Pros.\u2018Great Features\u2019 and \u2018Nasty Surprises\u2019 are my regular columns investigating operating system updates for the best features / biggest problems hidden behind the headlines.News of this first appeared on the popular MacRumors forums (something the site has followed up) before gathering momentum on Twitter where many users posted angry tweets demanding help from the official @AppleSupport account.So what is going on?

The problem is connecting to iTunes does nothing, the device is locked and forced reboots only return it the same state.As for the error code itself, according to Apple\u2019s code guide, Error 56 is loosely described as a \"hardware issue\", which doesn\u2019t sound like a credible explanation.Interestingly, from my initial investigations, it seems the newer iPad Pro 9.7 is affected far more often than the iPad Pro 12.7 (the two models have key feature differences).

I suspect Apple will make a statement about this sooner rather than later (I\u2019ve contacted the press team), and the two obvious paths are to a) Re-release a tweaked version of iOS 9.3.2 or b) quickly issue a new update (iOS 9.3.3?) as an emergency fix.All of which does little to aid the reputation of iOS 9 which has suffered numerous high profile problems, despite originally being a fine tuning of iOS 8 rather than offer a radical overhaul.Needless to say I\u2019d advise everyone (regardless of whether they own an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch) to steer clear of iOS 9.3.2 until more is known.___More On ForbesApple Leak Reveals 'Edgeless Display' New iPhoneiPhone 7 Leak Reveals Significant Feature RemovediPhone SE Vs iPhone 6S: What's The Difference?iPhone SE Vs iPhone 6S Review: Which You Should Buy?Apple Confirms iOS 9.3 Causes iPad, iPhone Problems", "answers": {"answer_start": [239], "text": ["bricking iPad Pros"]}, "id": "170016066732231_174009032999601"}, {"question": "State rep who likened food stamp recipients to wild animals loses Senate primary", "context": "Former South Dakota Gov.

However, most of the responses were from people telling him, simply, that there was no way he\u2019d manage to raise Biscuits on his own. Undeterred, though, Longo continued his research and eventually discovered the answer he was looking for.It turned out that he was going to be looking after a southern flying squirrel. Naturally, this species of squirrel usually resides in forests and woods, using trees as their habitat. They furthermore survive on a diet of nuts, seeds, fruit and insects as well as eggs and birds.The gliding rodents are nocturnal, and young squirrels tend to stay with their mothers until they are at least two months old. Since Biscuits had somehow become separated from her family, then, it was now down to Longo to fill her mother\u2019s shoes.So, for two months, Longo took Biscuits everywhere with him \u2013 even to work. He even bottle-fed her with a mix of puppy formula and heavy cream.As each day passed, Biscuits grew bigger and stronger, until she eventually became a healthy adult squirrel. In addition to getting the gift of life, though, Biscuits had also, again thanks to her encounter with Longo, gained a new family.Indeed, alongside her surrogate mother, Biscuits gained some four-legged family friends \u2013 in the shape of Longo\u2019s dogs. That said, given their difference in stature, Longo admitted that he had to \"watch them so they don\u2019t accidentally squish her.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [1450], "text": ["southern flying squirrel"]}, "id": "4wennf"}, {"question": "WHOA someone just paid $168000 for THIS", "context": "This past weekend proved to be a successful one for the famous Julien's Auctions, which recently hosted a sale of Bob and Dolores Hope's property.As the Los Angeles Times points out, someone showed great interest in Hope's antique cabinet, which was sold for $168,000.

One memorable shot showed off the singer's protruding package in arresting profile. Shortly after the photos hit the Internet, a web site called Breathe Heavy posted what it claimed was the same image prior to re-touching. If that claim were accurate, it would mean that Calvin Klein (well, not him personally, although maybe) had stuffed Bieber's stocking nearly to bursting. Here are the two images side-by-side:Bieber's team immediately insisted that Breathe Heavy's photo was fake, and requested the web site take it down. Breathe Heavy complied, originally replacing the photos with an editor's note, but eventually removing the entire post altogether. In that since-deleted note, Breathe Heavy's editor seems to accept Bieber's explanation at gunpoint.Bieber denies the photo is real, and I respect that and will believe him.The question, therefore, is: Are the claims of the Bieber camp correct, and the photo fake?Or did Breathe Heavy have the real photo, and capitulate in the face of legal intimidation?(It's easy to make a case that Breathe Heavy's photos are the real deal: We know that at least one photo was significantly retouched prior to publication, as Bieber's camp did not dispute an earlier TMZ story alleging that Calvin Klein sculpted Bieber's pecs, filled out his abs and bestowed him pubes in this ad from the campaign; furthermore, virtually every celebrity photoshoot in America gets touched up at some point. Why would Bieber's dick be a grand outlier?)But in many ways this dispute is just a lead-in to an essential American question: What exactly is Bieber packing?Let's be true detectives.This is a screencap taken from a video of the Calvin Klein shoot that Bieber himself posted to Instagram. Here we have a direct, unaltered view of his package and can plainly see that it looks quite different than the massive knot he is sporting in the photo advertisement. Front-bulge will almost always look less impressive than side-bluge, granted, and this is a fine bulge, certainly, but one that seems far off of Calvin Klein's idealized Burmese python.Last September, Bieber appeared onstage at the Fashion Rocks concert. For some reason he stripped down to his underwear, which produced a number of generally alarming photos such as this one.There are a number of things we can glean from this photo. One is that Justin Bieber has muscles. Look at the strong boy! Another is that his happy trail does indeed appear to stop abruptly right about where it does in the pre-Photoshop version of the Calvin Klein shot in which a model gropes him. But because Bieber wore jet black briefs that reveal no hint of bulge, this photo doesn't help us understand how big his dick actually is.For that, we must consult more candid shots.In 2013, Bieber went to Hawaii and jumped off a cliff. After exiting the water, he was photographed walking on the beach, resulting in the image you see here:This is perhaps the most revealing shot of Bieber's bulge in the wild. Does it look exceedingly large? I'd say not. In fact, it looks like any man's normal penis. Of course, it should be noted that it's unfair to judge a dick by what it looks like immediately after being submerged in the sea. However we can only work with the materials we have.Next we will consult a Tumblr called Justin Bieber's Bulge, a blog \"dedicated to Justin Bieber's glorious, wonderful bulge,\" which is not run by me. For a Tumblr devoted to one man's dick, it's a pretty boring blog, but there is one compelling photo.Here is a fan shot of Justin Bieber in concert, his leather drop-crotch pants dropped well below his crotch. We can see a hint of bulge, and from this angle it does not look like Justin Bieber is trying to smuggle a butternut squash through airport security, as Calvin Klein might want us to believe.That is evidence supporting the theory that Justin Bieber is adequately endowed. Arguing in favor of Justin Bieber's alleged big dick are two people: Tati Neves, a Brazilian model, and Bieber's trainer Patrick Nilsson. These two claim to have seen Bieber's flesh in the flesh, and if we're to believe them, Calvin Klein has staked its reputation on the right massive dong.Neves claims to have slept with Bieber during his infamous Brazilian sex romp. Here is what she told a British tabloid about Bieber's D:Speaking to The Sun, Brazilian model Tati Nevas said: \"Take it from me, he's well endowed - and very good in bed.\"Nilsson, meanwhile, was shuttled out to do damage control in the wake of the Calvin Klein Photoshop controversy. Here, according to Breathe Heavy, is his assessment:And to make up it, here's a new quote from Justin's trainer Patrick Nilsson, who says JB is packing. \"I can definitely confirm that he is a well-endowed guy. I sound weird saying that, but yes.\"Indeed you do.Two people claim to have personal connections with Justin Bieber's dick and claim it is large, but one is on Justin Bieber's payroll. While we will consider their opinions, the overwhelming visual evidence suggests that Justin Bieber's penis is perfectly average\u2014large enough to adequately fill out a pair of briefs, but not so large that it could arouse envy and terror when plastered across sprawling billboards, or choke a cow, without enhancement.In this case, it appears, Justin Bieber is the same as any man.Still, we don't know for sure, and here is where we turn to you, our readers: Have you ever had sex with Justin Bieber?

It appears that this young scholar felt offended because a homily on love made him feel bad for not showing love! In his mind, the speaker was wrong for making him, and his peers, feel uncomfortable.I\u2019m not making this up. Our culture has actually taught our kids to be this self-absorbed and narcissistic! Any time their feelings are hurt, they are the victims! Anyone who dares challenge them and, thus, makes them \"feel bad\" about themselves, is a \"hater,\" a \"bigot,\" an \"oppressor,\" and a \"victimizer.\"I have a message for this young man and all others who care to listen. That feeling of discomfort you have after listening to a sermon is called a conscience! An altar call is supposed to make you feel bad! It is supposed to make you feel guilty!

And he won a Super Bowl with the Packers in 2011.I almost fell on the floor when I saw his first paycheck. Amanda MasthayWhile Tim was trying to make an NFL roster, Amanda was working as a bank teller making $9 an hour. \"That was all the money we had. So we went from getting by to the first paycheck that he got. I almost fell on the floor when I saw it. I had never seen that much money in my life,\" Amanda said.They were tempted to buy things when they got the check. \"It took a lot of restraint and we sort of had to wrap our heads around it so that we didn\u2019t buy some car that we really couldn\u2019t afford,\" she said.Tim says that first paycheck was for $9,000, and that while it was a lot of money to him, too, it was at the league minimum. \"There was this influx of money at a young age where we were accustomed to being on scholarship, but it wasn\u2019t quite as traumatic as what some players who are top draft picks experience.\"The unique financial challenges of being an NFL player \u2014 and the wife of a playerWhen you start making a lot of money in the league, you have to figure out what to do with it, Tim said. \"How do I spend it? How do I save it? How do I budget? How am I going to play? Because it\u2019s very difficult to project how much you\u2019re going to earn in an NFL career. It might be a one-year career, and it might be a five-year career.\"How the NFL keeps its players from going broke (1:58) See what it's like to attend the NFL's Personal Finance Camp, which trains players on how to make their money last long after they stop playing.He said another challenge is that they\u2019re only paid during the season, except for a small off-season stipend. \"We receive eight or nine paychecks throughout the year and you\u2019ve got to do all of your budgeting and saving based off of those checks. It\u2019s a little different way of being paid than I think most people are,\" Tim said.But he also acknowledged that \"if you have some vision for the future, it\u2019s a fantastic opportunity in terms of investment.\"How they got so smart about moneyThe Masthays said their educations at the University at Kentucky \u2014 he was an economics major and she was a marketing major \u2014 were helpful, and that lessons they learned at a young age were also influential.\"If we ever went on vacation as kids, I remember being 6 or 7 and my mom would give me a check register and I would do chores around the house and go wash people\u2019s cars and save up for my spending money,\" Amanda said.Tim said that at Kentucky\u2019s business school he took a class in his sophomore year \u2014 in which he met Amanda, incidentally \u2014 and the professor said if you can save $10,000 when you\u2019re 20 years old and if the stock market were to return what it\u2019s historically returned, you\u2019d have $1 million when you were 60. \"I remember thinking, wow that\u2019s interesting,\" he said.That made him think of ways he could save some of his scholarship money, which was $750 a month. One way he did that was to live in a utility closet for $100 a month in a house that four of his friends lived in. He said it was just big enough to fit a bed.\"By the time I graduated I had saved $10,000 while living on a scholarship check. That\u2019s what I bought her wedding ring with,\" he said. (He spent part of it on the ring.)Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images Tim Masthay punting in a game against the Buffalo Bills on Dec. 14, 2014.One mistake?Tim said one area they could have been smarter in is real estate. They bought a house in Kentucky for the off-season while also owning a home in Green Bay. They\u2019ve since sold the Kentucky home but say they didn\u2019t like owning a home they only used for part of the year.Marriage and moneyAmanda said one of the reasons she was interested in attending the Personal Finance Camp was to see what they could do to minimize financial stress during the season.\"Finance is one of the biggest elements of stress for most people, so if there\u2019s something we can do that\u2019s going to make something else a little bit easier, then why wouldn\u2019t we want to learn about that and try to implement it in our lives?\"During the interview, Amanda and Tim were in agreement on most things and at times finished each other\u2019s sentences. When we asked Tim what he thought helped him go from being waived by the Colts in 2009 to setting records with the Packers in 2011, Amanda said: \"He married me.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [25], "text": ["Tim Masthay"]}, "id": "4n8r1i"}, {"question": "What weighs 2032 pounds is orange and can be seen in New York this week?", "context": "We were pretty impressed last year when Ron Wallace of Rhode Island grew a pumpkin weighing an astounding 2,009 pounds.

(The legislation would not prevent the hiring of guest faculty to conduct classes for which students receive credit.)Another bill would require state colleges to distribute student fees to pay for guest speakers \"proportionally based on membership\" of the student groups inviting the speaker.Both of these bills were authored by state Sen. Stacey Campfield (R-Knoxville) and were scheduled for their first committee vote on Wednesday. They are being pushed in response to Sex Week, a week-long student-organized and student-funded event at UT's Knoxville campus discussing sexuality, LGBT issues, sexual health and related topics.Campfield previously gained national recognition -- and stirred national controversy -- in 2012 for his \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, which would have prevented schoolteachers from discussing homosexuality. The legislation ultimately did not pass that year or when it was resurrected in 2013.Last week, two other state senators -- Education Committee Chairwoman Dolores Gresham (R-Somerville) and Government Operations Committee Chairman Mike Bell (R-Riceville) -- issued a letter to university leaders warning that state funding for the university may be in jeopardy, even though no taxpayer funds went toward Sex Week.Gov. Bill Haslam (R) has not said whether he would sign the bills into law.University leaders have repeatedly explained to lawmakers that they could not block Sex Week because the First Amendment protects college students' right to speak, and legal experts have backed them up. Bell and Gresham argued in their letter that the university could have shut down the event on the grounds that it was obscene. But UT system President Joe DiPietro told the Chattanooga Times Free Press that the university did not have \"any indication from anybody that there's an obscenity situation at all in this program.\"Attendance at Sex Week increased this year, according to the school's Daily Beacon. Sex Week organizers told HuffPost that there have been no protests against it on campus, while an UT administrator said in February that the university had received no calls of complaint from local community members or alumni.Nonetheless, the Tennessee state House has already passed a resolution condemning the students who organized Sex Week, which the House called \"an atrocious event.\"On Monday, a petition opposing Campfield's bills, signed by 3,500 students, was presented at the statehouse. In addition, 650 student letters were sent to lawmakers Friday.A UT-Knoxville graduate student provided The Huffington Post with a form email she received from Campfield in response to her objections to his legislation. The lawmaker said:While I support diversity of thought at the university, what is currently in place is not diversity. Sadly, when you look at a list of the paid speakers for the university the vast majority are from one point of view and balancing points of view are minimized.UT administration and faculty leaders, who firmly oppose both bills, agree with Campfield on that one point -- that a university should be a place where many voices are heard.\"If people realize we're an institution that doesn't allow outside speakers, I think that could have a significant impact,\" UT faculty senate president David Golden told the TV station WATE. \"I can think of no better place for contradictory, conflicting, controversial ideas to be presented than on a university campus.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [320], "text": ["University of Tennessee"]}, "id": "443941579582353408"}, {"question": "One of the most \u2018annoying things\u2019 on the entire planet just turned 20", "context": "Who's birthday is it, you ask?

Three years later, Amazon bought the online shoe retailer Zappos for $850 million.Over the past couple of years, Amazon has ramped up its investment in fashion by launching its own private-label clothing brands and sponsoring the first New York Men's Fashion Week.The company has also hired executives from luxury fashion companies, such as Julie Gilhart, the Barneys New York fashion director whom Amazon reportedly hired as a consultant, and vogue editor Caroline Palmer.Also in the past few years, Amazon has started to shift its fashion strategy toward offering more high-end designer names, such as Zac Posen and Stuart Weitzman.That shift has had some industry experts scratching their heads. Luxury fashion websites are typically well-merchandised and highly curated \u2014 not things for which Amazon is necessarily known.But Amazon's strategy appears to be working.Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that Amazon's apparel sales grew by $1.1 billion in the most recent quarter, while the department stores Nordstrom, Sears, Macy's, Kohl's, JCPenney, and Dillard's collectively lost $225 million in apparel sales in the same period.Department-store executives have blamed declining apparel sales on the weather and on consumers' changing shopping habits, which in recent years have gravitated more toward big-ticket items like televisions and vacations over clothing.The apparel market has only grown 1% annually in the past 15 years, according to Morgan Stanley.But department stores' loss so far has been Amazon's gain, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.\"We expect online (primarily Amazon) will continue to take share from department stores, but at an accelerating pace over the next five years given new evidence that Amazon is gaining traction in fashion,\" the analysts wrote in a recent note.In a 2012 interview with The New York Times, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gave a simple reason that Amazon was investing in fashion: \"Gross profit dollars per unit will be much higher on a fashion item,\" than with cheaper products, he said.", "answers": {"answer_start": [77], "text": ["Amazon"]}, "id": "54inls"}, {"question": "When People Ate People, A Strange Disease Emerged", "context": "When People Ate People, A Strange Disease EmergedEnlarge this image In 1962, a local leader in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea asks Fore men to stop the sorcery that Courtesy Shirley Lindenbaum hide caption In 1962, a local leader in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea asks Fore men to stop the sorcery that he believes is killing women and children. toggle caption Courtesy Shirley Lindenbaum In 1962, a local leader in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea asks Fore men to stop the sorcery that In 1962, a local leader in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea asks Fore men to stop the sorcery that he believes is killing women and children. Courtesy Shirley LindenbaumMost of the world didn't know anyone lived in the highlands of Papua New Guinea until the 1930s, when Australian gold prospectors surveying the area realized there were about a million people there.When researchers made their way to those villages in the 1950s, they found something disturbing. Among a tribe of about 11,000 people called the Fore, up to 200 people a year had been dying of an inexplicable illness. They called the disease kuru , which means \"shivering\" or \"trembling.\"Once symptoms set in, it was a swift demise. First, they'd have trouble walking, a sign that they were about to lose control over their limbs. They'd also lose control over their emotions, which is why people Once symptoms set in, it was a swift demise.

They'd also lose control over their emotions, which is why people called it the \"laughing death.\" Within a year, they couldn't get up off the floor, feed themselves or control their bodily functions.Many locals were convinced it was the result of sorcery. The disease primarily hit adult women and children younger than 8 years old. In some villages, there were almost no young women left.\"They were obsessed with trying to save themselves because they knew demographically that they were on the brink of extinction,\" says \"They were obsessed with trying to save themselves because they knew demographically that they were on the brink of extinction,\" says Shirley Lindenbaum , a medical anthropologist with the City University of New York.But what was causing it? That answer eluded researchers for years. After But what was causing it? That answer eluded researchers for years. After ruling out an exhaustive list of contaminants, they thought it must be genetic. So in 1961, Lindenbaum traveled from village to village mapping family trees so researchers could settle the issue.But Lindenbaum, who continues to But Lindenbaum, who continues to write about the epidemic, knew it couldn't be genetic, because it affected women and children in the same social groups, but not in the same genetic groups. She also knew that it had started in villages in the north around the turn of the century, and then moved south over the decades.Lindenbaum had a hunch about what was going on, and she turned out to be right. It had to do with funerals. Specifically, it had to do with eating dead bodies at funerals.In many villages, when a person died, they would be cooked and consumed. It was an act of love and grief.As one medical researcher As one medical researcher described , \"If the body was buried it was eaten by worms; if it was placed on a platform it was eaten by maggots; the Fore believed it was much better that the body was eaten by people who loved the deceased than by worms and insects.\"Women removed the brain, Women removed the brain, mixed it with ferns, and cooked it in tubes of bamboo. They fire-roasted and ate everything except the gall bladder. It was primarily adult women who did so, says Lindenbaum, because their bodies were thought to be capable of housing and taming the dangerous spirit that would accompany a dead body.\"So, the women took on the role of consuming the dead body and giving it a safe place inside their own body \u2014 taming it, for a period of time, during this dangerous period of mortuary ceremonies,\" says Lindenbaum.But women would occasionally pass pieces of the feast to children. \"Snacks,\" says Lindenbaum. \"They ate what their mothers gave them,\" she says, until the boys hit a certain age and went off to live with the men. \"Then, they were told not to touch that stuff.\"Finally, after urging from researchers like Lindenbaum, biologists came around to the idea that the strange disease stemmed from eating dead people. The case was closed after a group at the U.S. National Institutes of Health injected infected human brain into chimpanzees, and watched symptoms of kuru develop in the animals months later. The group, which Finally, after urging from researchers like Lindenbaum, biologists came around to the idea that the strange disease stemmed from eating dead people. The case was closed after a group at the U.S. National Institutes of Health injected infected human brain into chimpanzees, and watched symptoms of kuru develop in the animals months later. The group, which won a Nobel Prize for the findings, dubbed it a \"slow virus.\"But it wasn't a virus \u2014 or a bacterium, fungus, or parasite. It was an entirely new infectious agent, one that had no genetic material, could survive being boiled, and wasn't even alive.As As another group would find years later, it was just a twisted protein, capable of performing the microscopic equivalent of a Jedi mind trick, compelling normal proteins on the surface of nerve cells in the brain to contort just like them. The so-called \"prions,\" or \"proteinaceous infectious particles,\" would eventually misfold enough proteins to kill pockets of nerve cells in the brain, leaving the cerebellum riddled with holes, like a sponge.The process was so odd that The process was so odd that some compared it to Dr. Jekyll's transformation to Mr. Hyde: \"the same entity but in two manifestations \u2014 a 'kind', innocuous one and a 'vicious', lethal one.\"The epidemic likely started when one person in a Fore village developed sporadic \u2014 the difference is that others rarely come into contact with infected human tissue. The epidemic likely started when one person in a Fore village developed sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease , a degenerative neurological disorder similar to kuru. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about one in a million people in the U.S. develop CJDthe difference is that others rarely come into contact with infected human tissue.Though the Fore stopped the practice of mortuary feasts more than 50 years ago, cases of kuru continued to surface over the years, because the prions could take decades to show their effects.According to According to Michael Alpers , a medical researcher at Curtin University in Australia who tracked kuru cases for decades, the last person with kuru died in 2009. His team continued surveillance until 2012, when the epidemic was officially declared over. \"I have followed up a few rumoured cases since then but they were not kuru,\" he wrote in an email.Enlarge this image When Shirley Lindenbaum visited a South Fore village in 2008, one man said excitedly, \"See how many children we have now?\" Courtesy Shirley Lindenbaum hide caption toggle caption Courtesy Shirley Lindenbaum When Shirley Lindenbaum visited a South Fore village in 2008, one man said excitedly, \"See how many children we have now?\" Courtesy Shirley LindenbaumBut while they remain rare, transmissible prion diseases did not die out with the last kuru case, as people have found repeatedly in recent decades.

People have developed variant CJD after eating the meat of cattle infected with mad cow disease . Dr. Ermias Belay, a prion disease researcher with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says that's the only scenario in which there is \"definitive evidence\" that humans can develop a prion disease after eating the infected meat of another species.But, he says, there are still a lot of open questions about how and why humans get prion diseases.For one, it's still a mystery why animals, including humans, have those proteins in the first place \u2014 the Jekylls that can be so easily turned into Hydes. One leading hypothesis, Nature , is that they play an important role in the protective coating around nerves. For one, it's still a mystery why animals, including humans, have those proteins in the first place \u2014 the Jekylls that can be so easily turned into Hydes. One leading hypothesis, described recently in the journalNature, is that they play an important role in the protective coating around nerves.But here's the bigger question, says Belay: \"How many of these diseases actually jump species and affect humans?\"Kuru showed that people could get a prion disease from eating infected people. Mad cow disease showed that people can get a prion disease from eating infected cow. But what about other prion diseases in other animals? Could, say, hunters get sick from eating infected deer? That's what researchers in North America, including Belay, are trying to find out right now.\" Chronic wasting disease in North America is spreading fast,\" says Belay. The disease causes infected wild deer and elk to starve to death. \"In early 2000, we had about three states that reported CWD in the wild in deer and elk. Today , that number is 21.\"Belay says the disease is \"a little bit concerning\" because, unlike mad cow disease and kuru, where infectious prions were concentrated in the brain and nervous system tissue, in an animal with chronic wasting disease, the misfolded prions show up all over the body. They can even be found in saliva, feces and urine, which could explain how the disease is spreading so quickly among wild deer and elk.The CDC is working with public health authorities in Wyoming and Colorado to monitor hunters for signs of prion disease.\"Unfortunately, because these diseases have long incubation periods, it's not easy to monitor transmission,\" says Belay. He says he and his colleagues have yet to find any evidence that hunters have picked up chronic wasting disease from the meat of infected wild animals.\"And that, in itself, is good news for us,\" he says.But, as with kuru, it will take years \u2014 maybe even decades \u2014 before he can know for sure.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1137], "text": ["kuru"]}, "id": "51i904"}, {"question": "Prevent Your Kids From Playing Near This Dangerous Common Plant That Can Kill Them", "context": "Prevent Your Kids From Playing Near This Dangerous Common Plant That Can Kill ThemFor all who love cultivating or jump at the chance to adorn their home with various indoor plants, you ought not just think about counseling as a stickler in this field yet ought to likewise ensure on the off chance that you have scrutinized them right.

After a month of this regime, volunteers in an fMRI study at UCLA's School of Medicine showed brain activity that's associated with greater emotional stability (a stronger connection between pain-processing circuits and the prefrontal cortex), compared with the non-probiotic control group. One explanation: The good bacteria in yogurt send out signals that increase serotonin, the neurotransmitter that famously reduces anxiety. While most probiotic eaters don't have big mood changes, says lead author Kirsten Tillisch, MD, many (anecdotally) say they feel calmer over time. Ongoing research focuses on the subtle, cumulative, long-term effects of microbes as anxiety reducers.\"Your Housemates Influence You More Than You Think\"OK, you don't like yogurt. Or kimchi, tempeh, sauerkraut or other \"friendly-flora\" foods. But if your housemates eat them -- good news! Their healthy brain-boosting microbes have probably taken up residence in you. \"A number of gut microbes form so-called spores -- environmentally hyper-resistant cells that help to colonize them,\" explains James Scott, professor of occupational & environmental health at the University of Toronto. They're found on surfaces and in dust; we inhale and ingest them.\"You Found Wisdom Among The Dahlias\"A bacterium in soil called M. vaccae may be a cognitive enhancer, found a study published in Behavioural Processes. After mice ate a peanut-butter-flavored dose of the bug, they navigated mazes twice as fast as those not treated. Turns out, M. vaccae are among the gut bacteria that trigger a rise in serotonin -- which not only calms us but also boosts memory and concentration. (For mice, the \"superbrain\" effect lasted for at least a week after the last exposure.) We inhale and ingest this microbe when we're around dirt and plants; to what extent might it help us navigate life's mazes? Stay tuned.\"You're Hungry... Very, Very Hungry\"Surprisingly, gut bacteria may also control appetite, nudging you toward the oozy, creamy, crunchy foods they like. Fact is, the little buggers have species-specific appetites (a microbiologist can tell what types of food you eat and predict whether you're slender or not just from the variety of microbes in your stool sample). \"Bad guy\" bacteria may be partly to blame for your junk-food cravings -- by, for instance, sending out sugar-and-fat-jonesing signals via the gut-to-brain vagus nerve. Plus, some microbes may help you extract more calories from food and increase fat storage -- effectively making you put on weight.\"You Struggle To Burn Off Your Muffin Top\"While the blame for a big belly doesn't lie entirely with its wee inhabitants, the wrong microbes can contribute to it and make it harder to lose. In a study led by Liping Zhao at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, a 385-pound patient had unusually high counts of a fat-loving bug called Enterobacter in his gut. Zhao transferred the bacterium to his lab mice -- and here's the shocker -- they became fat and diabetic (control animals on the same high-fat diet did not), suggesting that Enterobacter helped cause obesity. As it turns out, the bug triggers chronic low-grade inflammation, which leads to insulin resistance and weight gain. The patient lost 113 pounds in 23 weeks on a diet of whole grains and \"prebiotics\" -- nondigestible high-fiber foods (examples include garlic, onions, chicory root, dandelion greens and asparagus) that feed friendly bacteria, like the Bifidobacterium in your yogurt, and starve the bad. (Within weeks, the Enterobacter was completely wiped out.)\"You Really Love A Smooth Grenache\"Good news here if you think dandelion greens are more compelling when paired with a strong drink. A study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that red wine's polyphenols -- those compounds whose heart-healthy benefits you've heard so much about -- also have prebiotic potential. Just one glass (9 ounces) of red wine daily for a month meaningfully boosted drinkers' ratios of good-to-bad gut bacteria (compared with alcohol-free and polyphenol-free gin-drinking controls). A caveat: The benefit doesn't apply to sweet dessert wines, which presumably feed the wrong microbiota.\"Sorry, You Have A High-Steak Problem\"Now consider pairing that grenache with something other than short ribs. The problem here is that certain red-meat-loving gut bacteria increase your heart attack risk, found a study at the Cleveland Clinic. When microbes digest compounds in meat called carnitine and lecithin, the liver uses the byproduct to make an artery-hardener that may be even more of a culprit in heart disease than cholesterol: trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Note: Only if you have bacteria in your gut that are accustomed to meat -- vegans don't -- could you churn out TMAO.

I see it from the perspective of the dog. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\"Nvidia\u2019s puppy love began informally several years ago, when one worker asked Huang if he could bring his dog to work. Sure, the CEO said: \"I used to have a dog myself. I\u2019d go home from work to see the dog during lunch.\"More dog owners started bringing their pets, and the company adopted a formal policy. Dogs have to be leashed while on campus, and attended by their owner. They aren\u2019t allowed near food areas, for sanitary reasons. If a meeting is on the schedule, the owner has to get a co-worker to keep an eye on the dog. In some cases, dog owners have been relocated to accommodate a neighbor with an allergy or other aversion to dogs.Since the Silicon Valley tech company occupies a sprawling, low-rise campus, there\u2019s plenty of outdoor space for letting the dogs out, as evident in the video above. The company provides poop bags, but no staff to handle the chore; owners must clean up after their own dogs.As our cameras rolled, several dogs frolicked in the grass, each seemingly comfortable with the others. Dog feuds are rare, Nvidia employees told us. Most dogs adjust quickly to the new digs once they start coming to work, and owners bring beds or blankets to cozy up on the floors of their cubicles, where dogs loll much of the day. Naps are often interrupted by co-workers or visitors who want to play.A few other companies allow dogs, including Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Salesforce (CRM), hotel chain Kimpton and candy company Mars. (About 7% of US employers allow pets in the workplace, according to the Society of Human Resource Management.) The perk saves owners the expense of paying for a dog walker at home. Some managers say pets promote collegiality in the office, and even help reduce employee stress. Nervous about your deadline? Here, pet this.Cats, alas, are not welcome at Nvidia, or any other company we\u2019re aware of, because they\u2019re less comfortable in unfamiliar places\u2014and they occasionally provoke the dogs.

The decision upheld the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) regulation that supports net neutrality.Net neutrality means that the Internet service providers or broadband carriers treat all data that travels over their networks in exactly the same way, much like our telephone service and power are regulated. It\u2019s the way the Internet has worked since its inception and we know how the Internet has transformed our lives in nearly everything we do. It\u2019s also spawned innovation and many new companies to create products and services we never imagined.But for many years, there has been an effort to change all this, led by the broadband carriers Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T. They've wanted to offer different classes of Internet services, one that provides faster speeds and better access to those websites that pay, and a slower access speed for those that don't want to pay.It was a way for these companies with with limited competition to generate more revenue, but it would also mean that the bigger companies that could pay more for faster service would receive preferential treatment for their content, compared to smaller startup companies that could not afford to pay.Three years ago when these rules were being formulated by the FCC, a groundswell of users spoke up in support of net neutrality, more than any other regulation in recent history. Four million citizens emailed and called the FCC objecting to any changes away from net neutrality. When comedian John Oliver explained on HBO\u2019s \"Last Week Tonight\" what was being proposed that might compromise net neutrality, it generated 45,000 responses to the agency in just a few minutes.Opposition also came from the major technology companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Netflix.

However, I don't think this is the new movie's name, but merely a working title that the production staff are using while on set.Indeed, Star Wars has a long history of doing this. Check out some of the working titles the franchise has utilized over the years.Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom MenaceAhh, Episode I, how hyped you were. But that is beside the point. While the title The Phantom Menace had many fans wishing they could forget, that was not always the title that was used on set. The original was Episode I: The Beginning. Pretty fitting, since it really is the beginning story of the world that we know and love. Personally, I liked this title much more than The Phantom Menace and I think they should have stuck with it.Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack Of The ClonesThis is when things started to get a bit better with the prequels. Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones brought us the lovable Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but also brought us one of the most hated characters ever in Jar Jar Binks. And this is pretty ironic, considering the working title for Episode II was Episode II: Jar Jar's Big/Great Adventure. Could you imagine if Lucasfilm actually ran with this? The backlash would have been insurmountable and I don't think it would have every recovered from that. #HailJarJar!Star Wars: Episode VI \u2013 Return Of The JediHighly regarded as one of the best films of all time, Star Wars: Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi is a pop culture classic.

Unfortunately, the working title was not as fun as its previous counterparts. It was titled after J.J. Abrams' production company and was referred to as Episode VII: Foodles. A bit adolescent I know, but fun and entertaining, nonetheless.Star Wars: Episode VII \u2013 Fall Of The Resistance (Possibly)The apparent leaked title of the next installment is Fall of the Resistance.

The leading explanation for the moon's origin, known as the giant impact hypothesis, suggests that the moon resulted from the collision of two protoplanets, or embryonic worlds. One of those was the young Earth, and the other was a potentially Mars-size object called Theia. The moon then coalesced from the rubble. [How Earth's Moon Was Made (A Photo Timeline)]\"By understanding the moon, we can tell the story of the early bombardment of Earth,\" study lead author William Bottke, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told Space.com.However, the precise timeline of this giant impact event is under dispute. The ages of the most ancient lunar samples the Apollo astronauts brought back are still debated, since these samples have typically been battered and heated by subsequent cosmic impacts.\"To understand the formation and evolution of our world as well as those in the inner solar system, we need to understand the timing of major events during the planet-formation era,\" Bottke said.To find out more about this giant impact, scientists developed a computer model of the event. They found that the impact not only created a disk of debris near Earth that formed the moon, but it also ejected huge amounts of rubble \u2014 as much as several percent of Earth's mass \u2014 away from Earth and the moon.The simulations found that numerous fragments from the moon-forming impact \u2014 hundreds of millions of which were at least a mile (1.6 kilometers) long \u2014 blasted the asteroid belt, striking asteroids there at speeds of more than 22,370 mph (36,000 km/h), more than twice as fast as typical crashes in the belt. These collisions from the moon-forming impact would have generated superheated material, the researchers said.\"In an explosion, there is often collateral damage, where nearby buildings and innocent bystanders are affected,\" Bottke said. \"Investigators can learn about the explosive device and the explosion itself by studying what happened to people, infrastructure, and whether trace amounts of the explosive device can be found among the blast damage. Here, the 'innocent bystanders' were the main-belt asteroids.\"Collisions against these asteroids in more recent times returned these remnants to Earth in stony meteorites, which the scientists now have analyzed and used to date the age of the impact.\"In a sense, the asteroid belt has been an eyewitness to multiple 'drive-by shootings' from the earliest time in solar system history,\" Bottke said. \"By reading the traces left behind, we can use asteroid samples to tell us who did it, when they did it and how they did it.\"The researchers deduced that the moon-forming impact occurred about 4.47 billion years ago, in agreement with many previous estimates.\"We can now use asteroids, for the first time, to tell us about many of the major events that took place in the inner solar system during the planet-formation era,\" Bottke said. \"This gives us a new window on a time period which has been virtually unknown up to now.\"This research \"raises the intriguing possibility that trace amounts of the primordial Earth or moon-forming impactor called Theia may still be found on asteroids today, or possibly within some of our meteorites,\" Bottke said. \"It may be simply a matter of looking and asking the right questions. Finding these materials would be one of the Holy Grails of geology \u2014 we have no rocks older than 4 billion years old on Earth, and no one knows the exact nature of the original building blocks of our planet.\"If future research can uncover examples of this impact in asteroid samples, \"possibly by getting them from an asteroid sample return mission like OSIRIS-REx, we would have one of the key pieces of the puzzle explaining why our world is the way it is, and what has changed since its infancy,\" Bottke said.The scientists detailed their findings in the April 17 issue of the journal Science.", "answers": {"answer_start": [108], "text": ["4.47 billion years ago"]}, "id": "590963499171520512"}, {"question": "Another country decriminalizes marijuana", "context": "As of Oct. 1, possession of marijuana is decriminalized in Switzerland.Anyone over the age of 18 caught with 10 grams or less of the drug will no longer have to make a court appearance and will not have offenses entered into their permanent record; instead, violators will have to pay a fine of 100 Swiss Francs (approximately $110), then be on their way.Lawmakers in the country relaxed weed regulations in an effort to unify what had been a patchwork of often confusing policies that varied from one local area to another.

The silence on orders for the iPhone 5C -- a week after it was announced -- has investors down on the tech giant.Since 2010, Apple's media blitz for its new iPhone has gone like this: On a Friday following the big unveil event, people can begin preordering the new phone, The Verge points out. A few days later, Apple trumpets the high number of new iPhones the public wants. In 2010, more than 600,000 iPhone 4s were preordered in 24 hours. By the time the iPhone 5 was released two years later, that preorder figure was 2 million.By creating the perception of scarcity, Apple's tactic worked to get some consumers off the fence about buying a new iPhone. But this year, Apple was mum about preorder numbers several days after iPhone 5C preorders went live. This didn't go unnoticed by Wall Street. With investors interpreting Apple's silence as weak initial 5C sales, Apple's stock slid to $450 on Monday from Friday's close of $465.But circumstances may be a bit different this year.

The company's top-line phone, with the new features like the fingerprint reader and desktop-like performance, should be the one with higher sales.

John Gruber, a well-regarded Apple observer, thinks it's a clever marketing move for Apple's second-tier phone:It\u2019s just that instead of putting the year-old iPhone 5 in slot #2, they\u2019ve created the 5C to debut in that slot. The 5C is, effectively, an iPhone 5. Same A6, same camera, same just about everything \u2014 except for the most obvious difference, its array of colorful plastic shells ... What changes with the 5C is that the middle tier is suddenly more appealing, and has a brand of its own that Apple can promote apart from the flagship 5S.With Android-run smartphones made by Samsung and Google cutting into Apple's market share, many see the global appetite for Apple smartphones waning.

The new study is the first to take into account the levels of arsenic in the participants' household water when looking at the amount of arsenic coming from foods.The results suggest that diet can be an important source of people's arsenic exposure over the long term, regardless of arsenic concentrations in their drinking water, the researchers said.The element arsenic occurs naturally in the environment. Long-term exposure to arsenic, even at low levels, has been linked to increased risks of bladder, lung and skin cancer, as well as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits the arsenic in drinking water to 10 micrograms per litter for drinking water, but there are few limits set for foods. [5 Things You Should Know About Arsenic]In the study, the arsenic levels in the participants' household tap water were well below the EPA limit, at 0.30 micrograms per liter, on average. However, 52 participants had tap water arsenic levels higher than the EPA's limits.The arsenic levels in participants' toenails were 0.12 micrograms per gram, on average. However, it is unclear what level of concentration found in toenail samples might signal an unsafe level of arsenic exposure, said study author Kathryn Cottingham, researcher at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.The toenail measurements in the study served only as a way to compare levels among people, the researchers said.People who reported drinking on average two and half beers or a glass of white wine every day had arsenic levels 20 to 30 percent higher than those of people who didn't drink.The study wasn't designed to find why higher consumption of beer and wine was linked to higher arsenic levels, but a few scenarios are possible, Cottingham said. [7 Ways Alcohol Affects Your Health]One possibility is that the ingredients in beer and wine are high in arsenic. It is also possible that arsenic is added during the filtration process that gives beer and wine their sparkly, clear looks, as one recent study suggested, Cottingham said.And lastly, alcohol itself may be to blame for the higher arsenic levels, by impairing the body's ability to detoxify arsenic.\"The mechanisms that our bodies use to try to get rid of the stuff that is not good for us can be impaired by alcohol consumption,\" Cottingham said.The researchers didn't find a link between arsenic levels and intake of rice, which is thought to be relatively high in arsenic. But in line with previous studies, they found that the more dark-meat fish people ate, the higher were their arsenic levels.People who ate dark-meat fish once a week had about a 7 percent higher arsenic concentration in their toenails compared with people who consumed these fish less than once a month.Although some foods are high in arsenic, people don't need to avoid them entirely, Cottingham said. \"Probably the best way to avoid exposure from diet is to mix it up in the foods, and not eat the same thing every day.\"It's also important to keep water sources safe, she said. \"If someone is drinking water from a private well, they should get it tested. Water is something we are drinking and using every day,\" Cottingham said. \"So knowing what your water exposure is, I think, is a big piece of the puzzle.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [66], "text": ["toxic metal arsenic"]}, "id": "405901363873611776"}, {"question": "How much will JPMorgan pay for 'London Whale' losses?", "context": "U.S. and UK regulators are expected to announce a civil settlement as soon as Thursday of their investigations into JPMorgan Chase & Co's \"London Whale\" derivatives loss, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The settlement, which is expected to be for at least $700 million, would resolve several civil probes into the multibillion-dollar trading losses at the largest U.S. bank last year.

(Albuquerque Mayor's Office)Republican Mayor Richard Berry was driving around Albuquerque last year when he saw a man on a street corner holding a sign that read: \"Want a Job.

His city\u2019s poorest residents told him they didn\u2019t want to be on the streets begging for money, but they didn\u2019t know where else to go.Seeing that sign gave Berry an idea.

In partnership with a local nonprofit that serves the homeless population, a van is dispatched around the city to pick up panhandlers who are interested in working. The job pays $9 an hour, which is above minimum wage, and provides a lunch. At the end of the shift, the participants are offered overnight shelter as needed.In less than a year since its start, the program has given out 932 jobs clearing 69,601 pounds of litter and weeds from 196 city blocks. And more than 100 people have been connected to permanent employment.\"You can just see the spiral they\u2019ve been on to end up on the corner.

A Berry\u2019s effort is a shift from the movement across the country to criminalize panhandling.

We had to ask producer Frank Marshall just how many cars were destroyed in the screen madness.Marshall knew the number right off the top of his head: 170 cars.And how did he know that number so quickly? \"I counted, I had to pay the bills,\" said Marshall, adding that these were just the destroyed cars from the scene. \"They are all in a trash heap somewhere.\"Producer Frank Marshall attends the Las Vegas premiere of 'Jason Bourne.'With a little more reluctance, Marshall did cop that this was close to a half-a-million in car costs alone \u2014 provided by manufacturers, but modified for the scene.It made for great watching even shooting the stunts which are almost entirely practical (VFX was used to erase safety elements and camera platforms).Damon would watch the stunts from his hotel room late into the night, even facing an early morning call the next day for work.\"We would shoot all day. And the second unit would go out and start blowing stuff up,\" said Damon. \"I would stand at our window and watch. It was like, 'I know it\u2019s time to go to bed, I have to get up at 6 a.m. But I just want to see this.' \"Matt Damon talks about destroying the Las Vegas Strip in his new movie 'Jason Bourne.' USA TODAYOne noble vehicle survivor was The Asset's SWAT truck, which ended up rolling right through the Riviera Hotel & Casino. Marshall pointed out that the building was set to be destroyed anyways (officially it was taken down in June). So Jason Bourne and that truck just helped the cause.\"I have always wanted to take a building that was going to be demolished and use that in the movie,\" Marshall said. \"So we helped destroy the Riviera.\"Surprisingly the custom-built SWAT truck was okay, allowing Marshall to marvel.\"It took out the marquee, went right into the lobby. But the SWAT truck survived pretty well. That thing was built to last,\" he said.The results were all worth it for Marshall, even if he had to send J.Lo flowers for delaying one of her Vegas concerts with all the road closures.The Bourne spy franchise has filmed chases in Paris, Moscow and Tangier.\"But we have never shut down a main thorough-fare,\" said Marshall. \"I feel it\u2019s our best chase yet.

Concrete boxes are replaced with olive groves, and the words \"traffic jam\" tend to mean that a group of goats have convened, gathering and blocking the road. Needless to say, I greatly enjoy the small villages of the Peloponnese. So when George Papageorgiou, the owner of Esti Olive Oil, asked me if I wanted to go to Kalamata to see how they harvest the olives and turn them into olive oil, I jumped at the chance. To me this was kind of like winning the lottery. I was going to the Peloponnese and getting a chance to enjoy some \"liquid gold.\"Being Greek, I grew up eating olive oil. I know others might disagree with me, but I will take a good quality olive oil over butter any day! I love using it to make popcorn. I drizzle it on fresh tomatoes and slices of bread. I use it to fry fish and as an ingredient in cakes. Before there were rules for the amount of liquid you could carrying on a plane, my mother and I would bring half-gallon containers of olive oil back from our trips to Greece.The best olive oils come from Greece. I say this with objectivity as a chef, and would like to think that this overrides any bias that my Greek heritage holds. In Greece it is said that the best of Greek olive oils come from the Peloponnese. For years I have wished that Greeks would be more like the Italians. The Italians do a fantastic job of exporting and promoting their products to other countries. With the booming introduction of Greek yogurt into the U.S., I'm hoping that Greek olive oil will soon follow suit. George Papageorgiou is trying to make that happen.The Esti olive grove in Kalamata is located in a beautiful sunlit valley. The grove of mature olive trees look as if they belong in Greek mythology. The olives must be harvested at a specific time during the ripening process. Like Goldilocks searching amongst the belongings of the three bears, George is in constant search for the olives that are \"just right.\" If the olives are too green the olive oil produced will taste bitter. If the olives are too black, the quality of the olive oil will be lost. It's a constant balancing act.As we headed into the olive grove, numerous fine mesh nets were being laid down to gather and catch all the olives. Workers set up ladders to reach the tall branches. The lower hanging branches were gently being shaken, taking care not to wound the trees. I began to collect olives in my little basket. As my hands turned a reddish-brown, I reminisced about the days I used to spend as a child, collecting olives with my yiayia.We took the gathered olives back to the production plant where George had them ground into paste using large millstones. \"This,\" he explained \"is the traditional method used for making olive oil.\" After grinding, the paste then gets slowly stirred in a separate container for 20 to 40 minutes. This is a process known as malaxation. With malaxation the slow churning action allows the small droplets of oil that were released in the milling process to aggregate, forming large droplets of oil which facilitates mechanical extraction. I was a bit overwhelmed during the whole process. I looked around the manufacturing facility, much like a child the first time they visit Disneyland. I snapped pictures. I wanted to see what was behind every door. I asked George if the oil we had witnessed being made was virgin or extra virgin. I had always assumed that the grading of \"extra virgin\" denoted a different process or different stage in the olive's ripeness. George shook his head. This was not correct. In fact, all olive oil produced by physical (mechanical) means is virgin. The differentiation of \"extra virgin\" is the virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and organoleptic criteria. In layman's terms it is the virgin olive oil that has low free acidity and no quality defects.The final room we visited that day was lined with shiny steel tanks, much like a winery. The storage of the olive oil in steel tanks helps to preserve it and keep it from oxidizing. It's the final resting place for the olive oil before it is bottled.In Greek, the word theoxenia comes from mythology and relates to hospitality; how hosts treat guests or even strangers. It's an important part of Greek culture. This was something George clearly keeps in mind. Before leaving the facility that day, George sent me home with a box filled with bottles of olive oil: virgin, extra virgin, organic extra virgin. That night, and many nights since, I have enjoyed his olive oils. In each bite I can taste the olive grove and its bright sun-kissed fruit. I can't help but think that everyone, even the French, might fall in love with olive oil if they had a chance to taste the Greek rendition.", "answers": {"answer_start": [16], "text": ["Peloponnese"]}, "id": "426590828782694400"}, {"question": "The ISIS Says It's Scared Of Only One Country And It's Not America Or Russia", "context": "Jurgen Todenhofer is the only journalist who spent 10 days with ISIS and returned home still breathing.

That\u2019s when he faces hate to be an alarmist, but Donald Trump could be on course to be elected president of the United States \u2013 and the decisive moment may well come on Monday night. That\u2019s when he faces Hillary Clinton in what is expected to be one of the most watched events in television history. The TV debates are perhaps the last chance for her to persuade the American people that this man is unqualified for, and unworthy of, the presidency and poses a genuine threat to the republic.If that sounds like panic, then I\u2019m not the only one. Sweaty-palmed nausea has become a leading symptom among those who tremble at the prospect of a Trump presidency. A new Slate podcast is called Time to Panic . Number cruncher Nate Silver, who gives Trump a 40% probability of winning, triggered another round of liberal angst this week when he tweeted that he had \"Never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial about something as they are about Trump\u2019s chances. Same mistake as primaries, Brexit.\"Never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial as they are about Trump\u2019s chances. Same mistake as Brexit Nate SilverThe source of the alarm is not so much the national polls, where Clinton is a few points ahead, but surveys from those battleground states where the presidency will be decided. In the last week, polls have put Trump in front in Ohio, Nevada, North Carolina and, most neuralgic of all, Florida.So low are expectations for his performance on Monday \u2013 where it is assumed that his opponent, a seasoned debater, will wipe the floor with him \u2013 that if Trump manages to speak in vaguely coherent sentences and not deliver a misogynist insult to Clinton\u2019s face, his advocates will declare that he looked \"presidential\" and anoint him the winner. If he can somehow persuade wavering voters that he is not so ridiculous as to merit automatic disqualification, he will have cleared a crucial hurdle.And for all her experience, Clinton heads towards this first, and therefore most important, debate facing some serious obstacles. She\u2019s been advised that she mustn\u2019t interrupt too much or talk over Trump: apparently voters react badly to seeing a woman act that way. According to a New York Times report well sourced from inside Hillary\u2019s debate preparation team, \"she does not want to be seen as pushy and play into gender stereotypes\". This was not something Barack Obama, or husband Bill, ever had to worry about.Activists in Berlin dismantle what they called a Wall of Hate showing Donald Trump in front of the Brandenburg Gate on 23 September.But Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies? One reporter following Trump has taken to logging the falsehoods he tells each day: no small task.Take two areas where you\u2019d assume that to be caught in untruth would be terminal for a presidential candidate. Trump has been exposed for serial lying over 9/11 , falsely claiming to have lost hundreds of friends that day; to have seen thousands of Muslims cheering the fall of the twin towers; and to have helped in the rescue effort. He even milked cash from a 9/11 relief fund.This week he was found to have raided $258,000 from the charitable foundation that bears his name to settle assorted legal problems. Earlier he dipped into that same charity box, filled by others\u2019 donations, to pay for a larger than life $10,000 painting \u2013 of himself. He lies about 9/11. He lies about charity. But on he strides.But Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies?\u2019So where can Hillary begin? If she calls him a liar, he\u2019ll hit back over her use of a private email server, calling her Crooked Hillary, knowing that some 60% of Americans believe she\u2019s dishonest. The risk is that he\u2019ll use her experience and expertise against her, casting her as the boring know-it-all against the freewheeling, entertaining guy who relies on good old gut instinct.If that sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s a show we\u2019ve already seen. In 2000 Al Gore was clearly the more accomplished, ready-for-office candidate. But he came across as impatient and pompous against the looser, backslapping George W Bush. Never mind that one was a visionary on the issue of climate change while the other would lead the US into the catastrophic invasion of Iraq. On the night, Bush came across better on TV.Which brings us to a core problem facing Hillary Clinton. Polls show there are millions of voters, especially young ones, who agree in big numbers that Trump is a racist and a sexist, unqualified for America\u2019s highest office \u2013 but who are refusing to back Clinton. One survey of 18- to 34-year-olds recorded dire numbers for Trump, but still found only 31% supporting Clinton, with 29% preferring libertarian Gary Johnson and 15% the Green candidate Jill Stein. If those numbers are replicated on election day, Trump will win.This too stirs queasy memories of 2000. In that year, a small but significant bloc on the left voted for Ralph Nader instead of Gore. More than 90,000 voted for Nader in Florida, a state Gore was eventually deemed to have lost by just 537 votes. Had even a tiny fraction of those Naderites decided to hold their nose and choose Gore instead, there would have been no Bush presidency \u2013 and no Iraq war.I know this is a sore, and contested, point among those who chose Nader, who to this day blame Gore for not doing enough to appeal to the left (forgetting perhaps that he also had to appeal to centrist voters in order to win the election). But the basic case is surely clear. In a two-party system like America\u2019s, if you want to stop Trump, then a vote for Johnson or Stein will not do it. Only a vote for Clinton can prevent a white nationalist bigot becoming the next US president.You might think this is all so obvious that it barely needs stating. But 2000 can seem like ancient history to those who don\u2019t remember it. And here, younger voters are not to blame. Older liberals haven\u2019t seared the Bush calamity into the minds of the next generation. They never turned 2000 into a cautionary tale of the cost of third-party indulgence. As the New Republic put it this week, \"Liberals have failed to teach millennials about the horror of George W Bush.\" (Republicans, meanwhile, bang on about the supposedly dismal presidency of Jimmy Carter to this day, just as British Conservatives invoked the 1979 \"winter of discontent\" for over three decades. It is the centre-left that is oddly reticent about exploiting its opponents\u2019 history of failure.)So now, even though the hour is late, this is the case Democrats must make. That this is an exceptional election because Donald Trump represents an exceptional menace, to America and to the world. It is indeed a referendum on Trump and the only way to vote no in that referendum is to vote Clinton.

Overton of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, is a way to explain how opinions about public policies shift over time and the constraints within which policymakers operate. The Overton Window is the spectrum of ideas that are politically palatable to voters. Although there is no limit to the number of policy ideas available, elected officials are limited to only actively supporting ideas within this window.For example, consider federal welfare policy. Even though there are loads of ideas about how to address poverty in the United States, politicians support and debate only a select few, such as the minimum wage, earned income tax credit, Medicaid, etc. These are within the Overton Window. Other ideas, such as a guaranteed basic income, even though they may be debated in other countries and supported by economists on both the left and the right, are never seriously considered by politicians because they lie outside the window.Trump\u2019s Public Policy, ExplainedWith this in mind, now consider Trump\u2019s recent about-face after he said the victims of the recent Orlando shooting should have been permitted to carry guns into the Pulse nightclub. About a week after making the statement, Trump appeared to backtrack and said he meant nightclub employees and guards should have been armed, not patrons.This wasn\u2019t just a flip-flop or mere pandering \u2014 it\u2019s more likely that Trump\u2019s movement on the issue is evidence he realized his initial stance was a step outside the Overton Window. While many of his supporters are no doubt staunch believers in the Second Amendment, even the NRA\u2014which endorsed him\u2014said, \"No one thinks that people should go into a nightclub drinking and carrying firearms.\"Using the Overton Window Theory to Your AdvantageIt is important to remember that politicians rarely move the window; more often than not, they only support policies that are deemed acceptable by their constituents. When Trump said Orlando nightclub patrons should have been armed, the backlash showed him that position was outside the window, so he stepped his stance back to one more acceptable to voters.The lesson in all this is that politicians, as Friedrich Hayek once wrote, are like corks bobbing in the sea. They only go where the current leads them, and it is us \u2014 you, me and our neighbors \u2014 who determine the direction of the current. In other words, if you want to see policy change\u2014if you want to expand the Overton Window\u2014appeal to the hearts and minds of your fellow citizens and the politicians will soon follow.", "answers": {"answer_start": [888], "text": ["The Overton Window"]}, "id": "50accr"}, {"question": "BREAKING: This State Just Banned the Sale of ALL Semi-Auto Rifles, Effective Immediately", "context": "Well, we all knew it was coming. You can\u2019t have a \"mass shooting\" without some political ladder-climber coming down hard on the rights of law-abiding Americans. And this time it is Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. She published this in The Boston Globe today.The Massachusetts assault weapons ban mirrors the federal ban Congress allowed to expire in 2004. It prohibits the sale of specific weapons like the Colt AR-15 and AK-47 and explicitly bans \"copies or duplicates\" of those weapons. But gun manufacturers have taken it upon themselves to define what a \"copy\" or \"duplicate\" weapon is. They market \"state compliant\" copycat versions of their assault weapons to Massachusetts buyers. They sell guns without a flash suppressor or folding or telescoping stock, for example, small tweaks that do nothing to limit the lethalness of the weapon. That will end now. On Wednesday, we are sending a directive to all gun manufacturers and dealers that makes clear that the sale of these copycat assault weapons is illegal in Massachusetts. With this directive, we will ensure we get the full protection intended when lawmakers enacted our assault weapons ban, not the watered-down version of those protections offered by gun manufacturers. The directive specifically outlines two tests to determine what constitutes a \"copy\" or \"duplicate\" of a prohibited weapon. If a gun\u2019s operating system is essentially the same as that of a banned weapon, or if the gun has components that are interchangeable with those of a banned weapon, it\u2019s a \"copy\" or \"duplicate,\" and it is illegal. Assault weapons prohibited under our laws cannot be altered in any way to make their sale or possession legal in Massachusetts.Yes, you\u2019ve read correctly. Every black rifle, and all of the variants, compliant versions, and anything that any of these yokels think might be used for an \"assault\" is now strictly illegal.What about all of those guns currently in the law-abiding hands of law-abiding gun owners?We recognize that most residents who purchased these guns in the past believed they were doing so legally, so this directive will not apply to possession of guns purchased before Wednesday. In the dozen years since the federal assault weapons ban lapsed, only seven states have instituted their own assault weapons ban. Many of those bans have been challenged (unsuccessfully) by the gun industry, and we anticipate our directive may be too. But our job is to enforce state laws and to keep people safe. This directive does both.Right. Because the criminals who are shooting up campuses and theaters and police protests\u2013they\u2019re all easily stopped by enacting a simple bit of legislation. I could tell you just how many mass murders were thwarted when the perpetrator ran up against a law like this, but I wouldn\u2019t want to let the wind out of the AG\u2019s sail.In the face of utter inaction by Congress, states have a duty to enact and enforce laws that protect people from gun violence. If Washington won\u2019t use its power to get these guns off our streets, we will. Not only do we have the legal authority to do so, we have a moral obligation to do so.Wait\u2013to get the guns off the street? I thought she\u2019d just said it was legal to own them if you\u2019d bought them before Wednesday. Now she\u2019s got a moral obligation to get them \"off our streets.\"If I were in Massachusetts, I\u2019d be feeling a bit paranoid right now.What does the state consider an \"assault weapon\"?\"Assault weapon\", shall have the same meaning as a semiautomatic assault weapon as defined in the federal Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. section 921(a)(30) as appearing in such section on September 13, 1994, and shall include, but not be limited to, any of the weapons, or copies or duplicates of the weapons, of any caliber, known as: (i) Avtomat Kalashnikov (AK) (all models); (ii) Action Arms Israeli Military Industries UZI and Galil; (iii) Beretta Ar70 (SC-70); (iv) Colt AR-15; (v) Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR and FNC; (vi) SWD M-10, M-11, M-11/9 and M-12; (vi) Steyr AUG; (vii) INTRATEC TEC-9, TEC-DC9 and TEC-22; and (viii) revolving cylinder shotguns, such as, or similar to, the Street Sweeper and Striker 12; provided, however, that the term assault weapon shall not include: (i) any of the weapons, or replicas or duplicates of such weapons, specified in appendix A to 18 U.S.C. section 922 as appearing in such appendix on September 13, 1994, as such weapons were manufactured on October 1, 1993; (ii) any weapon that is operated by manual bolt, pump, lever or slide action; (iii) any weapon that has been rendered permanently inoperable or otherwise rendered permanently unable to be designated a semiautomatic assault weapon; (iv) any weapon that was manufactured prior to the year 1899; (v) any weapon that is an antique or relic, theatrical prop or other weapon that is not capable of firing a projectile and which is not intended for use as a functional weapon and cannot be readily modified through a combination of available parts into an operable assault weapon; (vi) any semiautomatic rifle that cannot accept a detachable magazine that holds more than five rounds of ammunition; or (vii) any semiautomatic shotgun that cannot hold more than five rounds of ammunition in a fixed or detachable magazine.Time for some crafty legal eagles to start dismantling this gibberish.", "answers": {"answer_start": [181], "text": ["Massachusetts"]}, "id": "4tuj89"}, {"question": "One of the most useful iOS apps is finally back", "context": "One of the Most Useful iOS Apps Is Finally BackA popular video-playing app is finally back in the App Store.VLC, the cross-platform multimedia player that plays a variety of different file types, is once again available on iOS devices after being pulled from the App Store around the time iOS 8 released in September.

Other people pictured were described in neutral ways, such as \"loves Chinese food.\"Both men and women rated the altruistic people as more attractive for long-term relationships \u2014 but women showed a stronger preference for altruism than men did.More recent research suggests that altruism could be even more appealing than good looks.In a study published this year, researchers looked exclusively at heterosexual women's preferences for attractiveness and altruism in men.About 200 women were asked to look at photographs of men's faces. Half those faces had been determined to be extremely physically attractive; the other half had been determined to be extremely physically unattractive.The women saw two pairs of faces at a time, one attractive and one unattractive.Each pair of faces was displayed alongside a description of a scenario and how each man behaved. For example: \"two people are walking through a busy town and see a homeless person sitting near a cafe.\" One man goes into the cafe and buys a sandwich and tea for the homeless person; the other man pretends to use his cellphone and walks straight past the homeless person.All the women were asked to rate each man on how attractive he was for a short- or long-term relationship.The researchers walked away with several key findings.First, as previous research had found, altruistic men were more attractive than nonaltruistic men.Second, altruistic men were more attractive for long-term than short-term relationships. When it came to short-term relationships, nonaltruistic men were in fact more desirable than altruistic men.Perhaps the most striking finding was that altruism appeared to be even more appealing than physical attractiveness when it came to long-term relationships.

Because the metal body smartphones usually have stripes on their back.

Well, look after the sliders below to know more the white lines.What Actually Are Those White Lines?The answer to this question is a simple one. The White Lines on all metal bodied smartphones are 'Antenna Bands'. Antenna Bands are the things usually the antenna in radios or other electronic devices which convert the electric power signals to radio signals and vice versa. This is bit technical. In simple words, the antenna bands are used to receive and transmit signals.Who Started This?Previously, there used to some other design policy where the antenna bands are not visible, however, it is worth noticing that the old age smartphones didn't use metal to build on. Instead, there are iPhones with glass on front and back.Now, this White lines trend was started by Apple with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Soon, it was followed by other manufacturers. It is worth noticing that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were heavily criticised for their design language.Are they harmful?Absolutely, No. They are just antenna bands to send and receive signals.

This one would fill your living room and uses robotics and artificial intelligence.Ripcord, a startup backed with a $9.5 million funding round led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, has created a machine its founders think is key to solving a huge problem faced by companies as they try to access data that hasn\u2019t made it into the information age \u2013 billions of boxes of paper files.``We\u2019re drowning in problem,\u2019\u2019 said co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Alex Fielding. ``The issue is not demand.\u2019\u2019Like many Silicon Valley start ups, Ripcord believes its technology is the answer to a prosaic problem. While the internet has been around for more than 20 years, the amount of printing done by companies is still increasing. All of those forms, invoices, reports and receipts typically end up in boxes in warehouses, where the data sit and are either useless or require a lot of time and money to access.Ripcord\u2019s machine aims to take away much of the labor of turning that paper into usable electronic information. The first problem most people face when they\u2019re armed with a computer and even the fastest desk-top scanner is how paper files are attached to each other. The company reckons that it takes the average person six to eight hours to scan a box of papers. Much of the time goes to removing staples and other fasteners that cause the dreaded paper jams. A chunk more time is wasted on the categorization and naming of files in the computer.With billions of boxes of files in storage across the U.S. alone, that\u2019s a lot of hours of work and paper cuts. Ripcord\u2019s machine takes stacks of paper, pulls out any staples and loads them one sheet at a time onto a conveyor belt for rapid scanning, up to one sheet a second. That seemingly inane task is done at breakneck speed by a combination of industrial robot and sensors all powered by artificial intelligence software.Ripcord isn\u2019t just processing paper and putting it into boxes. It\u2019s offering a service where it charges as little as 0.4 cents a sheet per month for scanning and uploading to the cloud in formats that its customers can access and integrate into other commonly used corporate computer systems. It also stores the information for them. The goal: all that paper comes out of the machine and goes into the shredder for recycling. Warehousing paper information is a $25 billion annual market, according to Hayward, California-based Ripcord.The machines aren\u2019t going on sale. Ripcord is aiming to deploy hundreds of the giant devices in warehouses where hoppers of paper will be moved around by robots. Fielding is keen to point out that his automated system isn\u2019t putting people out of work, it\u2019s going to change the way that filing work is done. The machines still need human input in preparing files and supervision of the speedy process, even though it has built-in error correction and will even divert through a trap door multiple sheets or paper with sticky notes attached.\"We\u2019re not replacing people with machines, we\u2019re giving them much more interesting things to do,\" Fielding said. \"I don't think anyone went to college to become a human staple remover.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [134], "text": ["Ripcord"]}, "id": "845072946053943296"}, {"question": "200-foot sinkhole swallows 12 buildings", "context": "A sinkhole nearly 200-foot wide in China's Sichuan Province has swallowed at least 12 buildings and is expected to keep growing.The sinkhole opened up around 12:40 a.m. Friday in the city of Guangyuan, Shanghai is reported.

He knows exactly what he's doing,\" over and over. Although the beleaguered Rubio campaign was quick to call it another Bush dirty trick, the Marco Robotos were animated by operatives from Democratic Super PAC American Bridge. Kevin McAllister, the PAC's deputy communications director-turned-costumed robot, said the campaign's only inspiration was provided by Christie, and the opportunity was irresistible.Rubio strategists downplayed the attention their candidate's debate performance was getting. \"I think it's a narrow band of folks who read each other on Twitter,\" Jim Merrill, a Rubio senior advisor for New Hampshire, said, dismissing the entire affair. \"We're going to focus on President Obama.\" Any slip of the gears isn't going to affect Tuesday's results. \"We have a very strong ground game.\"Merrill was also unconcerned by the fact that a morning pancake breakfast appeared to be transforming into a mid-morning rally. \"I don't know where they got the idea to come at 8:30. Nobody said that,\" he said. \"People just got here early,\" he explained, pointing out that the campaign was offering free muffins, berries, and juice.Not everyone\u2014especially the hundreds who'd received the campaign's invitation for an 8:30 pancake breakfast\u2014was satisfied. \"It's the Marco Rubio pancake breakfast\u2014so far we've had no pancakes and no Marco Rubio,\" joked Bob Durant, a Rhode Island lawyer who was political touring with his family and friends. \"You wonder is it really because you have so many people,\" that things are delayed, Bob asked, or is it because, after the debate, \"He has to re-write his entire speech, since Chris Christie ripped it up?\"His wife, Meg, was watching it all with more of an insider's eye. The Michigan state director for the Bush/Quayle 1992 campaign, Meg Durant looks for the little things to tell her how a campaign is doing. After Saturday's Republican debate, she grabbed a couple of Christie and Bush signs for her kids. Some Christie volunteers followed her all the way back to her car. \"They waited for me to drive away,\" to make sure she didn't replace one of their Christie signs with a Bush sign. \"Christie's people, they are street fighters.\"Still, she admitted, it's been difficult to predict how things are going. \"I thought Jeb had it. I thought he was a shoo-in,\" when the race first got underway. After Bush began to founder, \"I thought Marco would have walked away with it. But after last night...\" she gave a little shrug. \"I hope this morning is the Marco we want to see.\"Durant was also finding it difficult to figure how event turnout, especially with the rising interest in political tourism, translates into votes. \"There are ten of us here,\" she noted, \"and only one of us is a New Hampshire voter.\" That would be her cousin, Tom Stevens, a retired lawyer who moved from Ohio to New Hampshire two years ago. He's still undecided; his wife was for Hillary Clinton until she went to a Clinton rally last week. Now, she's undecided, too.When Rubio finally showed up a little after ten, he was as flat as, well, a pancake. \"A couple of housekeeping items,\" were the first words out of his mouth. \"We couldn't figure out how to make pancakes for 800 people\u2014I hope they fed you.\"It didn't get better. He's still going to abolish the federal Department of Education, but he's decided to offer Tom Brady \"a cabinet position. Belichick, too.\" And then, because at best he can only really modify and not stop himself, \"Well, I'm going to say it again.... Barack Obama is the first president, at least in my lifetime, that wants to change the country. ... Not fix its problems; he wants to make it a different kind of country.\"Things perked up a little bit when Rubio agreed to answer a few questions, calling on innocuous-looking white haired fellow in a bright flannel shirt. Identifying himself as Capt. Dan, a 65-year-old retired charter boat operator and a Rubio constituent from Florida, he wondered what a President Rubio would do about the climate change flooding that's putting his house in Miami Beach underwater. \"I'm going to get my money out of it and move to higher ground,\" Capt. Dan explained, who added that he doesn't expect to live forever. Isn't there something Rubio can do about climate change \"for the young people?\"Rubio has a script for this question. Climate change legislation hurts the economy. It hurts the economy and has no real impact on the environment. The better approach is to support innovators of American energy. \"I say, 'OK, if we pass this bill how many feet of sea rise will it prevent?'\" he explained, reasonably, as he has on this and many other occasions. \"'Well, it won't prevent any sea rise.' OK, well how many degrees of temperature will it avoid going up?' Well, it won't do that either.\"But afterwards, Capt. Dan professed to be happy with Rubio's response. \"Last time I heard him say it,\" which just happened to be in Manchester two days ago, \"he said it was too expensive, too difficult, wait.\" This time \"he started to look to the side a little bit, see a different way to see it.\" Possibly so. Reframing climate change as a family issue, not an environmental one, could certainly cause Rubio some cognitive dissonance. Very possibly that could be the conscious intent of folksy Capt. Dan, who traveled all the way to New Hampshire because \"this is such an intimate state where I have access to all the candidates....where I can ask the questions I want to ask.\" Folksy Capt.

This company seems to think so", "context": "Something tells me that God loves a good chandelier. After all, they are grandiose and self-righteous in a way that only a person with great power and questionable taste could truly appreciate. And the folks over at Ivory & Deene home furnishings completely concur.To them, a chandelier is a holy object ordained by God to illuminate the rooms of only those who seek His approval and judgment. Consequently, homosexuals certainly aren't fit to hang such a blessed and holy fixture in a stage production where faggotry and fabulousness are main themes.As we prepare to open our production of God Hates This Show: Shirley Phelps-Roper in Concert Live From Hell in New York City next month, we've been on the prowl for set dressings and items befitting a cabaret room located in the pits of Hell -- the setting of our play, which imagines the Westboro Baptist Church and Shirley Phelps-Roper having been damned to the underworld for all eternity.It seemed that an elaborate (read: gaudy) chandelier, preferably red in color, should hang dramatically over the live rock band that is part of the show. Our hunt led us to the lovely, Christian businesspeople at Ivory & Deene. Impressed by the ornate lighting fixtures and reasonable prices, we decided to contact the management to see if we could negotiate a discounted price, as our theater company is a nonprofit with a very limited budget. What did we have to lose? We thought that the worst thing they could say was \"no,\" but it turns out that that's not the worst thing they could say. Here's what they did say to our producer Will:We are sorry we will not support your production because we are Christians and we believe the first marriage God instigated was between and [sic] man and a woman and when he created them he said \"very good\", not just \"good\" like He did with the rest of creation, but \"very good\". Mankind has moved so far from the way God intended us to live, we must return to God's way of living, it is the best way and the blessed way, hope you can understand. Kind regards, RubyPunctuation, spelling, and grammar aside, Ruby obviously intended to make an example of us by denying us an item that surely only a homosexual would dream of purchasing anyway. (If you saw the chandelier, you'd understand.) She seemed intent on reaffirming her archaic and unfounded belief system by misquoting the Bible. (God did not say \"very good\" when he created man and woman. Look it up.) And rather than simply declining our request, as so many companies we have sought sponsorship from have, Ruby decided to do the least Christian thing she could think of: directly and personally judge and shame strangers. She may not have called us \"faggots,\" but she might as well have.I worry about Ruby. She seems to be oblivious to the fact that a great deal of her clientele are most likely queer. I mean, come on. Girl is selling amazing satin sheets. Whether she knows it or not, Ruby is singlehandedly contributing to the decoration of bedrooms where abominations unimaginable occur. We're screwing on your sheet sets, Ruby. And in a way, a little part of you is screwing right along with us. Just thought you'd like to know. You're gay by association. Find a shower. Quick.The truth is, Ruby can't be nai\u0308ve enough to think that she has never sold a product to a gay person. But the anonymity of the marketplace and the exchange of money for goods is all it takes for Ruby and Ivory & Deene to turn their heads the other way. Only when directly presented with the truth do they suddenly take issue.Perhaps we'll directly and anonymously purchase the chandelier from Ruby and hang it proudly on our set.

From the mundane to the truly unique -- from yoga class to family dinner to your bath tub -- we are spotlighting the environments where you are truly unplugged. Want to share your own? Send us your story here.I\u2019ve been taking ballet all my life since I was very young, and while I did spend time during high school as part of a company, it has mostly been a lifelong hobby. As an undergraduate [at Howard University], at Harvard Business School, and as I moved to different cities -- Denver, Boston, Detroit, New York -- I'd always find a ballet studio. It just brings me so much joy to dance.To me, a sacred space should really be where you can practice something that brings you pure joy. And something that helps you celebrate what it is to be human. In this case, ballet is all about the human body and what you can do with the human body in a graceful way.Something about having the barre, the wooden floor, the pianist, the instructor, made me feel as though all else was outside. It became this sacred space. And though it was a place that was all my own -- where I could challenge and test myself -- it was also a collaboration with others, because truly you dance together, not by yourself.Everyone who is there has opted in simply because they love ballet and they enjoy dancing. So there's something about being with the like-minded women (and some men!) who are there with me.The truth is, that during class, I never looked at my phone. But one time I did and it became a reminder for how sacred the space should really be. My boss emailed me, during the break, between the barre and the floor exercise and I had just decided to check my email. Email draws you in and there\u2019s always some action item -- something that triggers a response.For the rest of the class, it made it much more difficult to concentrate. Remembering the exercise, going across the floor. That one email check pulled into class what I should be doing after class. I lost being in the moment, being present and the joy faded. I realized that I had invaded my sacred space with technology.And though I didn't typically look at my phone, once I set up the rule that I would not look at my phone for those 90 minutes, it became a new form of self-discipline and a gift to myself of 90 minutes in which everything else can wait.Bonita Stewart is Vice President of Partner Business Solutions at Google.

This is in line with the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games (about $566, even though that medal was 31 grams heavier). However, it is a long way off from the approximate $708 record price of the 2012 London gold medal, due to the record high price of gold and silver at the time.If the entire medal was made of gold it would be valued at nearly $22,000, which is why 1912 was the last time all-gold medals were awarded.A total of 2,488 medals were produced for the Rio 2016 Olympics (812 gold, 812 silver and 864 bronze) by the Mint of Brazil. All of the medals are the same size and weight, with a diameter of 85 millimeters and a weight of 500 grams, making them the heaviest medals in the history of the Summer Olympics and tied for the largest medal in the Summer games. At least three Winter Olympic medals were larger and heavier.Each of the 812 Olympic gold medals is plated with six grams of gold (the minimum required by the International Olympic Committee) with 99.9 percent purity. The remaining 494 grams is made of silver with 92.5 percent purity (the standard for sterling silver), according to the Mint of Brazil. The purity silver standard also is a minimum IOC requirement.Each of the 812 silver medals contains 500 grams of sterling silver. The podium value is about $305. The 864 bronze medals contain 475 grams of copper (95%) and 25 grams of zinc (5%). The bronze medals have little intrinsic value.For the first time in history, according to Rio Olympic officials, the medals are designed in a curved dome-shape, higher in the center, so the thickness ranges from 6 mm to 11 mm.Sustainable DesignThe medals were produced with methods that the Rio 2016 Olympic officials described as \"symbols of sustainability and accessibility .\" More than 30 percent of the silver used in the production of the medals are recycled from mirrors, waste solders and X-ray plates. The gold is mined entirely free of mercury. More than 40 percent of the copper used in the production of the bronze medals came from the industrial waste of the Mint of Brazil through a process that was developed internally.Even the ribbons attached to the medals were well thought out with half of the materials woven from recycled polyester polyethylene terephthalate (PET) yarn (recycled post consumer polyester made from bottles). Each medal comes with a sustainably sourced wooden box, certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, that contains a miniature sculpture of the Rio 2016 logo.The front of each medal has the Rio 2016 logo framed by laurel leaves (which were given as awards for the ancient Olympics). The reverse reveals the traditional etching of , the Greek goddess of victory, in the foreground and the Greek Panathnaic Stadium in the background. Above Nike is the engraving of \"XXXI Olympiad\" and the Olympic Rings. Adding a personal touch, the name of the event in which the medal was awarded is engraved by laser along its outer edge.Paralympic medals with new sound innovationThe 2,642 Paralympic award medals were made by the Mint of Brazil and are of the same weight, dimensions and materials as the Olympic medals. The design is highlighted by a trail of seeds that wraps from the front to the reverse side of the medal. Olympic officials say the seeds represent \"the courage, persistence and development of athletes.\" The Rio 2016 Paralympic Games logo is on both sides of the medal, with Braille inscriptions on the front side.For the first time the medals come with sound, so visually impaired athletes can identify the medal\u2019s color . Metal ball bearings were placed inside the medals which rattle when shaken. The gold medal makes the loudest noise and the bronze the weakest.More than 100 employees in various professional fields\u2014including, art, sustainability, engineering and production\u2014were involved in the making of the 5,130 medals.Anthony DeMarco is founder of the Jewelry News Network.

So-called realistic optimists combine the positive outlook of optimists with the clear-eyed perspective of pessimists, new research has found.These realistic optimists may get the best of both worlds, using their realism to perform better at work and elsewhere, but aren't getting bogged down by unhappiness, said Sophia Chou, an organizational psychology researcher at National Taiwan University, who presented her findings at a meeting of the American Psychological Association in Honolulu, Hawaii earlier this month. [7 Things That Will Make You Happy]Optimists and pessimistsPast research has shown that optimists value thoughts that make them feel good about themselves, whereas pessimists prize a more truthful vision of themselves. But a clear-eyed view can be bad for pessimists' well-being, as they tend to be more prone to depression, Chou said.Optimists tend to live longer and be healthier overall.After several years working in business, Chou noticed there were some people who were both optimistic and realistic, and that they tended to be very successful. She wondered whether realism and optimism were really diametrically opposed.So Chou administered a battery of personality surveys to about 200 college and graduate students in Taiwan. The surveys tested how many \"positive illusions\" the students held, as well as whether they were more motivated by self-enhancement or reality.Realistic viewsThe optimists sorted into two camps: the realists and the idealists.\"Realistic optimists tend to choose accuracy over self-enhancement; the unrealistic optimists tend to choose self-enhancement,\" Chou said.Interestingly, the realistic optimists also got better grades, on average, than their less grounded peers -- probably because they didn't delude themselves into thinking they would do well without studying or working hard, Chou said.Traditionally, a more realistic outlook is paired with poorer well-being and greater depression, yet the realistic optimists managed to be happy. To understand why, she dug deeper into the personality assessments.Self-control keyShe found that realistic optimists believed they had more self-control and control over their interpersonal relationships.\"Every time they face an issue or a challenge or a problem, they won't say 'I have no choice and this is the only thing I can do.' They will be creative, they will have a plan A, plan B and plan C,\" Chou said.That allows them to stay cheery and upbeat about the future, even if they recognize the challenges of the present.Being a realistic optimist does have one downside, however: They are more prone to anxiety than their completely unrealistic peers. That's likely because they recognize the possibility of failure, whereas their counterparts use positive illusions to ease their anxiety, Chou said.The findings suggest that realistic and unrealistic optimists may actually be very different personality types, Chou said.In order to cultivate a rosy-but-realistic outlook, people should maintain a clear-eyed view of reality, but emphasize what they can control in most situations, she said.", "answers": {"answer_start": [119], "text": ["realistic optimists"]}, "id": "374425931613364224"}, {"question": "This GOP lawmaker does NOT approve of students wearing pro-gay shirts", "context": "A Missouri lawmaker caused a firestorm of controversy last week after he tweeted disparaging comments about teens wearing T-shirts that support gay-straight alliances.Rep.

The grey and blue combination in her outfit is the main reason she is thought to have ties with Soldier 76 and Reaper.Nirolak also mentioned about Reaper\u2019s dialogue in the game where he says, \"Where is Sombra when you need her?\", which can be another massive hint.Apart from these, there has also been information that Sombra was seen in the character select screen along with a sniper scope, which is another strong signal that the character might be on its way to Overwatch soon.There are also speculations that Sombra could well be a villain, who would join the other villains on the game later. Overwatch is already short of villains and this can be a logical speculation, but anything cannot be confirmed until we hear it from Blizzard.At this point we can certainly say that there\u2019s something or someone called Sombra, which is directly or indirectly related to Overwatch, but it\u2019ll be interesting to find out what Blizzard thinks on this.We\u2019ll update you as soon as we come across more news on this.

That means even Vin Diesel -- who, thanks to the \"Fast and Furious\" movies, stars in one of the most popular film franchises in existence -- had to independently finance the third \"Riddick\" movie. How did he get here?Let's start with \"The Chronicles of Riddick,\" the sequel to \"Pitch Black,\" which was released on June 11, 2004. The film, which cost around $110 million, grossed just $57 million at the North American box office, making it one of that summer's costly misfires. After that result it was understandable that a studio -- in this case, Universal -- was leery about putting more money into the franchise, even at this new film's reported bargain budgetary cost of $38 million.Maybe, though, that was for the best. In this new installment, we find Riddick (Diesel) left for dead on a desolate planet. After a lengthy recuperation segment, the focus of the film shifts to a group of bounty hunters who are on the planet searching for Riddick. So, Riddick, the character, shifts from our hero to, as \"Riddick\" director David Twohy calls him, \"the bogey man.\" It's something Twohy, who also directed the previous two installments, says would never have happened had this been a straightforward studio movie.Did you ever think this third movie would ever happen after \"The Chronicles of Riddick\" underperformed?Yeah, I had my doubts after the second one. And we suffered some slings and arrows. According to the studio, we spent way too much money and didn't make enough back. So, that's never a good formula. So, I had my doubts. If you speak with Vin, I'm thinking he would say, \"Never a doubt that we were going to do a third movie\" -- because that's just the kind of guy he is. He is a big dreamer. I'm more the pragmatist of the duo.Vin Diesel has had quite the resurgence over the last couple of years.Look, I've learned never to count Vin Diesel out. Just don't do that. And I guess it's because he is a very smart guy. Smarter than people give him credit for.I enjoyed that in \"Riddick\" the stakes are big to the characters, but not compared to all of the big summer movies we just saw. These people basically just need to leave a planet and that's it.And look, I've been in those meetings, too. Where it's, \"We have to up the stakes. We have to give it a ticking clock\" ... So, I hope that \"Riddick,\" if nothing else, feels a little more handmade than factory-made. That's what I set out to do and Vin was certainly along for that ride, too.The first half hour, we're pretty much alone with Riddick. Then the film focuses on the bounty hunters and Riddick becomes almost the bad guy, even though we spent the first part of the movie with him.That's right. Now, that's something the studio would have fret out about. \"Wait a second. You are totally sympathetic with Riddick while he's trying to survive, but then you're using him as the bogey man.\"Why did you want to do that?Because he is both those things. He is a man. He is a survivor -- a survivor with skills. And enough personal code that he can be sympathetic to us, but, at the same time, never let the audience forget that he's a stone cold killer. But, you know I think it works. Because I have to introduce those new characters ... I have like 10 new characters to establish. And I can bolster Riddick's roar -- his legend -- by having them talk about him as they glimpse him.Do you think the success of the \"Fast and Furious\" movies helped to get \"Riddick\" made?Yes. But, here's the cyclical nature of the business. Because \"Pitch Black\" did well, that allowed him to be part of the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise. And guess what? What goes around, comes around. So, on the basis of that, he was dropped into a major part in \"The Fast and the Furious.\" And based on the success of that, yes, that does impact on our ability to launch this third one. Even though Universal didn't want to make it at a certain point. In fact, they didn't make it. Do you know that story?I do not.It goes like this. After \"Chronicles,\" they said, \"We are out of the Riddick business. It's just a straight business calculation of us. You spent too much money and you didn't make enough back. So, no, we're not going to do anymore.\" Vin, being the savvy guy he is, said, \"Well, give me the rights back.\" And they didn't want to do that ... I think this was about the time that \"Fast 3\" had already shot and they were testing it. Maybe it wasn't testing as well as it should have and they decide, \"Maybe we need a cameo from Vin\" -- because he wasn't in that movie. So, I do believe that in his savviness, Vin said, \"Don't pay me for that cameo. Just give me the rights back.\" So, his company basically controls the rights and because I control all of the sequels and remakes. So, we can't make a movie without each other, nor would we want to. So, that's how he got the rights back and I think that was a great business move.So, ultimately, we did it as an independent movie. I wrote a spec script. We sold it in Berlin for international. We came back into town looking for a domestic partner. I thought it was going to be Sony or Film District -- they were both eager to have the movie. And then, guess what? Universal raises their hand, \"Well, what about us?\" And I said, \"This doesn't feel right to me\" But Vin, he was saying, \"That was then, this is now\" ... So with the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise and his relationship with Universal over that and the strength of those, we placed it again at Universal. So, the company that kicked us to the curb [laughs] picked up the movie and will be distributing it in the U.S. and Canada.So Universal didn't put any money into the film?They put money into it for their domestic distribution rights.So Riddick is an indie film?Here's an example of how it's an indie film. I wrote a spec script, we sold that. We went up to Montreal and I think I did one polish on my original script -- and then we shot that. Then, when it comes to editing, I got to the point when I wanted to show it to 50 people in a room, just to see what they understood: What was clear to them and what was not clear to them. Because of things aren't clear to them, the audience can't enjoy it and I still have time to go to the editing room and clean it up. I didn't have it scored and didn't fill out forms, I just stood in front of them and asked them questions ... I had the studio heads in once, but we were basically locked at that point.

I was there, and this is what I'm seeing, and I remember what I was feeling when I re-watch the videos.\"Snap will soon be a big, public company, but not that long ago it was just an app commonly associated with sexting. Its foundation in disappearing messages\u2014the once-unique feature that made Snapchat a must-have\u2014made sending naughty material seem less risky, even if it's with a complete stranger. And sure, Snapchat's built out their product to appeal to different users, in different ways, via the news-focused Live Stories and publisher perspectives on Discover (which is a Mashable partner). But by releasing a physical product like Spectacles, Snap Inc. has repositioned itself as a lifestyle tech company.

And this one's time is coming.Given the limited availability of Snapchat Spectacles, the sexual accessorizing of them has yet to begin in earnest. Mashable reached out to more than two dozen Spectacles owners and found that the majority hadn't engaged in any sexual act with their new toy.Yet\u2014most of them have at least had the idea.\"I hadn't thought about that as a personal use, but one of my first thoughts was when we'd see this pop up in porn,\" one early Spectacles owner explained.\"My friends have talked about all the possibilities that can be made with these, including sex,\" another said. \"The Specs will definitely be 1000% less creepier than Google Glass.\"Of course, there's the idea, and then the execution. And people have definitely been executing on the potential for Spectacles as a sex toy. So far, reviews are mixed.Of the 26 Spectacles owners we spoke with, Mashable did hear from several people who wore the glasses during masturbation, foreplay and sex.\"I've used it by myself just to dance around and be sexual, and also, used it in the beginning stages [of sex] when I was still getting intimate with a partner,\" Rachel, the media entrepreneur, said.\"With the glasses on, it definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit.\"The experience wasn't seamless. Rachel and her partner chose to wear one pair of glasses and pass them back and forth during foreplay. Spectacles also only records up to 30 seconds, with the press of the button three times.\"It definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit,\" she said.It wasn't Rachel's first time making a home sex video and while she appreciated the new visceral perspective Spectacles had to offer, wearing the glasses were a bit distracting, and made her feel more than a little self-conscious.\"There was a barrier, in terms of personal space. I didn\u2019t feel as close to the person, because one of us had the sunglasses on,\" she said.Jennifer, a publicist, said she and her partner both wore them the first time, which felt fun, but two pairs of Spectacles make for strange bedfellows\u2014literally. To say nothing of the viewing, itself.\"We thought we would try it, but the first five minutes we were laughing. I think teal\"\u2014the color of her Spectacles\u2014\"was a bad choice,\" she said.\"I deleted the videos right after, and we tried again.\"A series of 10-, 20- and 30-second clips are now saved on her personal iPhone, which Jennifer said she's privately masturbated to, and also, sent to her boyfriend.While Rachel had the idea to use them for sex early on in her Spectacles ownership, she was initially concerned about whether or not her videos would post instantly to her Story.They don't. The app saves all Spectacles videos in a dedicated tab within your Snapchat Memories.

Will they see these as a different kind of POV niche that it might be able to financially profit from or build a more general porn viewership,\" said Lynn Comella, associate professor of gender and sexuality studies at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \"Will it be different from Google Glass?\"Snap declined to comment for this story, but a spokesperson pointed to the Snapchat support and safety pages for reference. Spectacles' support page has no direct mention of using Spectacles during sex. The gadget's warnings page addresses flying and driving, however.All sex-related context is, for now, designated to the community guidelines for Snap and Snapchat. That's not too surprising given that Spectacles only upload videos directly to Snapchat. A pornography section of its community guidelines states, \"Snapchat prohibits accounts that use public Stories to distribute sexually explicit content.\"There's no control or limitation to what users do with Snapchat privately, of course.Cindy Gallop, an advertising industry veteran and consultant who is now focused on a social sex site called MakeLoveNotPorn, said she wished Snapchat would be more explicit and embrace the use case.She credited Snapchat's \"explosive growth\"\u2014which now boasts 150 million daily active users\u2014to sexting, and though Mashable can't prove that, it's clearly a part of the app.\"Spectacles can be and will be used in sexual context,\" Gallop said. \"I would love to see Snap be open and active about it.In fact, Spectacles owners have some recommendations. \"The glasses kept slipping off.

The album also features a direct Kanye-Jesus comparison in the song \"I Am A God\": \"I know he the most high / But I am a close high.\"With Kanye bringing a Jesus lookalike on stage during his current tour, The Huffington Post decided now is a good time to compare the relative places of Kanye and Jesus in the popular zeitgeist.To do this, we analyzed a year's worth of Twitter data (from Oct. 21, 2012 to Oct. 20, 2013) via the third-party service Topsy. When comparing Jesus and Kanye on Twitter, the first question is what terms should we use for the comparison?There are a lot terms Twitter users use to reference Jesus: there's the broad \"Jesus,\" which includes other people named Jesus, the more specific \"Jesus Christ\" and foreign language versions -- Jesucristo in Spanish, gesu\u0300 cristo in Italian. Some users also tag the name, resulting in mentions for @Jesus.There are a lot fewer version of \"Kanye.\" \"Kanye,\" which includes other people named Kanye (though there are far less people named Kanye than Jesus), \"Kanye West\" and @kanyewest. (There are also nominal instances of people tweeting his nicknames, like Yeezy and 'Ye.)Since Jesus doesn't have a genuine Twitter account, and Kanye has a habit of deleting all of his tweets, using @ mentions didn't seem that promising or fair. Looking to minimize instances of other people named Jesus and Kanye, we decided to start our search comparing \"Kanye West\" with \"Jesus Christ\":According to the data, in the last year worldwide, looking at only original Tweets (no retweets, no replies), \"Jesus Christ\" had 3,936,585 mentions, while \"Kanye West\" had 4,541,349 mentions. Pretty impressive for the 36-year-old rapper.While West's total was greater overall, on a typical day, Kanye didn't have more tweets than Jesus. Kanye's numbers were skewed by a few high mention days and his median tweets/day (9,981) were, in fact, lower than Jesus's median tweets/day (10,458). In fact, Jesus had more tweets on the majority of days (187 out of the 365 days in the year).So, using \"Kanye West\" vs \"Jesus Christ,\" their Twitter mentions are pretty close.But what about the foreign language tweets? Kanye has an advantage with foreign language tweets, because countries with the Latin derived alphabets, as far as we know, refer to Kanye West as Kanye West while, as mentioned above, there are many different ways to reference Jesus.Only looking at the United States offers a clearer picture. Although there are some residents in the U.S. who speak foreign languages, Jesus Christ is generally used as the identifier. Here, again using \"Kanye West\" vs \"Jesus Christ,\" Kanye had slightly more mentions overall, 2,429,931 to 2,224,895, but they were about equal when the day-to-day totals received consideration. Breaking it down state-by-state, some states tweeted more about Jesus (orange states) while other states tweeted more about Kanye (green states).When did users tweet the most about Jesus and Kanye?Kanye West's top five days:1) 8/26/2013, 90,993 tweets. The day after his \"Blood on the Leaves\" performance at the VMAs2) 12/31/2012, 70,701 tweets. New Years Eve. Kim Kardashian announces she's pregnant with West's baby.3) 9/27/2013, 58,608 tweets. West feuds with Kimmel on Twitter and gets in a confrontation with paparazzi.4) 6/18/2013, 51,012 tweets. The official release of his album \"Yeezus.\"5) 6/21/2013, 48192. The announcement of his baby's name: North West.Jesus Christ's top five days:1) 12/25/2012, 37,459 tweets: Christmas.2) 5/9/2013, 36,393 tweets: Ascension Thursday3) 3/31/2013, 35,955 tweets: Easter Sunday4) 3/29/2013, 29,576 tweets: Good Friday5) 4/23/2013, 26,921 tweets: St. George's DayJesus Christ's biggest day-of-the-week was Sunday, while Kanye's biggest day-of-the-week was Monday.When you look at the stream of \"Jesus Christ\" tweets, you will quickly notice a complication: a large amount of the \"Jesus Christ\" tweets are idiomatic (\"I just stubbed my toe. Jesus Christ! #notblessed\") and don't actually refer to the literal Jesus Christ. Usage of the exclamatory \"Jesus Christ\" is probably more popular among those who are at least exposed to Christianity, so it may still be a good signal for Jesus's popularity among the Twitterati. That being said, the idiomatic Jesus Christ doesn't directly refer to the person Jesus Christ, while Kanye West refers to the person Kanye in almost all cases, so if we're looking for an apples-to-apples comparison, then Jesus Christ's numbers are significantly smaller.How much smaller? We looked at a sample of the hundred most recent tweets for \"Jesus Christ\" on Twitter using the Twitter search and found that 73 percent of uses of \"Jesus Christ\" were idiomatic, leaving 27 percent literal. This search occurred during a tense soccer match (lots of \"Jesus Christ\" exclamations) and is too small of a sample to offer definitive conclusions, but it signals that the idiomatic \"Jesus Christ\" is accounting for a significant portion of the examined mentions.So what happens if you compare \"Jesus\" vs \"Kanye\"? Jesus had significantly more tweets: Kanye had 10,412,097 tweets compared to Jesus's 51,724,902 tweets. Looking again at a sample of the hundred latest tweets to gauge what's going on, we see the following breakdown:Idiomatic: 22%Literal: 70%Other Person's Name: 8%This sample is again too small to prove definitive, but even if only 25 percent of those tweets that contain the word Jesus refer to the religious figure, \"Jesus\" would still have more literal tweets than \"Kanye,\" and the proportion of tweets referring to Jesus appears to be much higher than that. We also haven't accounted for different names for Jesus in languages other than English. When you break it down by region, mentions of \"Jesus\" are more popular than \"Kanye\" pretty much everywhere.So, it looks like Jesus is \"the most high\" on Twitter -- except for Justin Bieber, who trumps Jesus in popularity with 68,257,710 tweets for the search term \"Bieber\" during the same period.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1732], "text": ["original Tweets"]}, "id": "396395351667531776"}, {"question": "This is the most common birthday in the world", "context": "It also means that 9 months prior this auspicious day is also the date that your parents got on the train to sexy town.Researchers at Harvard University found that September 16 is the most common birthday.Think about it.

One of her secret savings accounts had grown to $900 behind her back.Rhoads, a 37-year-old Los Angeles-based sales director for a jewelry line, has an account with Digit, a financial technology company with an algorithm that tracks users\u2019 income and spending patterns. It painlessly spirits small amounts of money out of checking and into a savings account every two or three days. \"I just thought it was such a good idea, to set it and forget it,\" said Rhoads, who says she is \"like a squirrel\" in her approach to saving. Digit sends texts with balance updates, which she largely ignores because \"I like to pretend the saving is not happening.\" Getting consumers comfortable with putting their finances on customized autopilot, starting with a simple, no-fee\u2014and no-interest\u2014savings account, is the San Francisco startup\u2019s mission. In two years, its users have saved more than $350 million this way, according to its 31-year-old founder and chief executive officer, Ethan Bloch. When the product moved out of pilot mode, in February 2015, users were saving about $1 million a month; now that\u2019s more than $35 million a month. Digit won\u2019t disclose the size of its user base but says it has tripled from about a year ago.Digit had a savings bot before bots were cool, or at least before the hype in the financial technology world reached a fever pitch. Its product is simple. An algorithm looks at a user\u2019s average, high, and low checking account balance, when the user is paid, and whether the pay cycle is smooth or choppy. Then, after looking for bills due in the next week or two and analyzing recent spending, it moves an amount it judges the customer won\u2019t miss to a savings account. The company makes money from the interest rate it gets on account assets.Digit announced today that it will be the first savings bot on Facebook Messenger\u2019s platform, so users can just use Facebook to communicate with it. When Digit moved out of its pilot phase, it communicated only by text, a natural language for many users, since 17 percent of them are aged 21 to 24, and 44 percent are from 25 to 34 years old. Rhoads said they\u2019re \"cute texts\" with \"some personality\" and \"not annoying at all.\" After text messaging came iOS and Android apps for users.The company is now working on what Bloch called \"the first artificial intelligence-powered financial goal program.\" Users would set a date and amount (and pick an emoji, of course), and Digit\u2019s algorithm would make a series of projections based on balances to determine the optimal amount needed to start saving toward that goal\u2014or point out that the goal is unrealistic.Also on the product horizon is having Digit\u2019s algorithm figure out how to \"move every dollar where it should go, at the right time, to minimize fees [on student loans, credit card  accounts, etc.] and maximize gain,\" Bloch said. There are hitches. Since Digit isn\u2019t a bank, it can\u2019t pay interest, and it will be competing in an environment of rising rates. Bloch said interest rates \"are not a huge deal\" for his customers, because they regularly withdraw money and tend to save small sums.Another hurdle is that traditional bank technology can make it hard to connect accounts. \"Banks have not made it easy for customers to get their data,\" Bloch said. \"Because of that, Digit and products like Acorns, Venmo, Betterment\u2014every day we have bank difficulties that affect thousands of customers.\"Behavioral finance underlies much of Digit\u2019s design. Take the goal function, for example: If users get more specific about what they are saving for, research suggests, they are less likely to withdraw the money.\"If an account is labeled 'Charlie\u2019s Education Fund,' I\u2019ll think harder about withdrawing it than if it\u2019s just labeled 'Savings,'\" Bloch said. Currently, 70 percent of Digit users withdraw 80 percent of their savings every 90 days, mainly to pay bills and meet short-term needs for cash, to pay off debt, or pay for travel.Bloch's broadest long-term goal is to make Digit\u2019s user interface far more conversational, to \"humanize it\" so users feel more in control when they communicate with it.\"We want to make Digit understand more\u2014not as broad as Alexa or Siri, but widen the aperture a little more\u2014related to finances and your money,\" he said. \"One day, it would be awesome to say, \u2018Hey, Digit, am I OK for retirement?\u2019 And all Digit does is send back a thumbs-up emoji.\"That kind of complex analysis won\u2019t show up anytime soon. But after a Series B round of fundraising led by venture capital firm Ribbit Capital, Digit\u2019s 22-person team is sitting on $25 million in cash. That, Bloch said, will let the company \"be somewhat protected for the next few years in pushing the envelope, largely to invest in product development.

An average of six polls from news organizations on Real Clear Politics shows Trump leading the Republican field with 33.2%. And among Democrats, Clinton, with 47.2% is just five points ahead of Bernie Sanders.There is, of course, a difference between polls and casino odds.

Clinton is still the frontrunner, with 8/11 odds. (Marco Rubio has 6/1 odds on that site, while Sanders is far back at 12/1.)Put in real world dollars, that means if you were to bet $100 on Clinton and she won, you'd see returns of $172.73.

They quit smoking using hypnotherapy. Celebrities have discovered the effective results of hypnotherapy and have used it to conquer their own smoking habits.Researchers at the University of Iowa combined more than 600 studies of smoking cessation programs involving 72,000 people from North America and Europe1. Hypnosis was found to be over 3 times more effective than nicotine replacement therapy and 15 times more effective than quitting cold turkey.A comparison study of smoking cessation treatments was conducted by North Shore Medical Center and Massachusetts General Hospital2. 26 weeks after discharge, 50% of patients who received hypnotherapy exclusively were non-smokers compared to the 25% of patients who didn't and only 16% of patients who used nicotine replacement therapy alone.Types of AddictionSmoking addiction is a combination of two types of addiction. There's the physical addiction, then there is the mental, or psychological addiction. Although nicotine addiction is considered one of the strongest addictions, even more addictive than cocaine, the good news is that the physical side of things doesn't last very long. In fact, some believe that you will lose the physical cravings for nicotine in as little as 3 days.The real struggle for smokers is overcoming the mental addiction. The smoker has essentially trained their subconscious mind to make smoking an \u0093automatic\u0094 behavior. These are the habits and rituals that a smoker has developed over the years such as smoking when they wake up, just before they go to sleep, after they eat, when they drive, when they drink coffee or alcohol, and so on.How Hypnotherapy Helps You QuitSo what will hypnotherapy do? Rather than just treating the physical urges that are part of your smoking habit, hypnotherapy targets the subconscious drive behind the addiction, and breaks the positive associations with cigarettes that the mind has formed. This is replaced by an empowering, smoke-free perspective the hypnotist offers through verbal suggestions that deem smoking as something undesirable \u0096 or unnecessary \u0096 to do. Gradually, these suggestions take hold and diminish the smoker's impulse to smoke. Furthermore, hypnotherapy is considered to be a far more safe and natural method to quit smoking with and is non-habit forming. This cannot be said about most of the stop smoking aids we currently have on the market.But going to a hypnotist can be expensive. As much as $200 per one hour session, and requiring as many as 5 sessions for the entire treatment. If you're a celebrity like the ones mentioned earlier, then this isn't a problem. But can the average smoker afford to go to a hypnotherapist? Well, that question is left to the individual, but consider that a pack a day smoker will spend in excess of $2000 a year on cigarettes, not even including the increased cost of life and health insurance, and doesn't include the drastic cut in your ability to earn.", "answers": {"answer_start": [472], "text": ["Hypnosis"]}, "id": "4tvvhd"}, {"question": "Famous crime writer's home is up for grabs...interested?", "context": "When famed crime novelist Elmore Leonard passed away in July at the age of 87, readers and moviegoers alike mourned the author of titles like \"3:10 To Yuma,\" \"Get Shorty,\" and \"Rum Punch\" (later filmed by Quentin Tarantino as \"Jackie Brown).For the ultimate fan (maybe one who read all of our favorite Leonard books), what better way to remember Leonard than by purchasing his $2.399 million dollar estate in Bloomfield, Mich.?

Exclusive by @ritholtz:", "context": "How much compensation the folks at Pacific Investment Management Co., better known as Pimco, haul in each year has always been a topic of fascination on Wall Street.In 2012, news reports suggested that the firm's top 30 partners \"pulled down an average $33 million a year in compensation in recent years.\" A subsequent column by Felix Salmon guessed that the average investment professional at Pimco was making \"roughly $7 million each\" annually.A Pimco spokesman denied Salmon's claim, responding that \"The numbers cited in your blog post today are wildly inaccurate.\"Salmon's speculation was, indeed, wildly inaccurate -- to the downside. Actual bonuses at Pimco are higher, much higher, than probably any outsiders previously believed. Based on news reports, public records and new data obtained by Bloomberg View, it appears that Pimco had a 2013 bonus pool for its 60 managing directors of almost $1.5 billion.So how much have Pimco's top executives earned? According to documents provided to Bloomberg View by someone with knowledge of Pimco's bonus policies, the numbers break down like this: Gross earned $290 million as his year-end bonus for 2013. Mohamed El-Erian, Pimco's former chief executive officer and one-time heir apparent to Gross, received $230 million (El-Erian is a fellow Bloomberg View contributor).And the story doesn't end with Pimco's two most visible (former) employees. Former deputy chief investment officer Daniel Ivascyn -- now serving as Gross's replacement as Pimco's chief investment officer -- took home a $70 million bonus. Wendy W. Cupps, the global head of product management, garnered $50 million, making her one of the highest-paid woman in finance. (Her rocky push into equities was the subject of well-publicized haranguing by Gross.) Douglas Hodge, now the CEO, took home $45 million of holiday cheer. These giant bonuses almost make the $22 million awarded to Pimco\u2019s president, Jay Jacobs, seem puny.The top three managers after Gross and El-Erian -- Ivascyn, Cupps and Jacobs -- were rumored to have been behind the coup that sent Gross packing to Janus Capital in September. Next month, free of Gross and El-Erian, these three will have an extra half a billion or so to keep to themselves or distribute to the other managing directors.Gross\u2019s bonus -- 20 percent of the total bonus pool for 2013 -- places him in a compensation class of his very own. To put that figure into context, in 2013 Gross made just shy of what the next 20 publicly held finance company CEOs made combined.In the world of sports, you would have to take the total salaries, winnings and endorsement deals of LeBron James, Lionel Messi, Kobe Bryant, Tiger Woods and Roger Federer -- together -- to be on par with Gross.* * *How Pimco became such an earnings machine is a quirk.It has been four decades since it was spun out of Pacific Life Insurance Co., a move that was made in part to allow Gross a freer hand to manage the insurer\u2019s fixed income portfolio. Since then, Pimco has grown into a behemoth, in terms of the bottom line and as a force in the bond market.Much of what we know about Pimco stems from Allianz SE's $3.3 billion purchase of 70 percent of the firm in 2000. A publicly traded German insurer, Allianz has released some details about Pimco\u2019s operations in its quarterly earnings reports. That data, along with mutual fund disclosures and filings, provide hints about the firm\u2019s revenue.We can estimate earnings by looking at the largest Pimco funds. The 20 biggest have an average fee of about 61 basis points. Let\u2019s lower that to account for discounts given to large institutional clients, and we get a rough estimate of about 50 basis points. On $1.82 trillion dollars, that yields $9.1 billion in revenue a year.Pimco is, by any measure, a fabulously wealthy company. Using my back-of-the-envelope revenue estimate, it generates far more revenue per employee than any bank or asset manager -- almost four times as much as Goldman Sachs.When Allianz bought into Pimco, it picked up about $250 billion in assets under management. Pimco currently manages about $2 trillion.The bonus structure is a quirk of that original deal: Allianz\u2019 partial purchase left Pacific Life owning 30 percent of Pimco. But Pacific Life wasn't interested in running the asset-management business and even after the Allianz deal, everyone involved continued to defer to Gross\u2019s financial and managerial judgment.Thus Pimco -- based in Newport beach, California, and 6,000 miles removed from its majority owners -- remained fully autonomous. Bloomberg View's fee analysis suggests Allianz takes about 70 percent of the total revenue Pimco generates annually (plus or minus a few percentage points). Pimco keeps the rest.This same deal structure continued even after Allianz purchased the 30 percent of Pimco that it didn't already own from Pacific Life in the mid-2000s. A subsequent restructuring in 2011 saw Gross and his team gain even greater control over the firm. That gave Pimco so much freedom in relation to its corporate parent that, as one analyst described it to Bloomberg News, it appeared as if it was \"the tail wagging the dog.\"* * *Part of the reason for Gross's longevity after the Allianz takeover -- and another element of the firm's enormous wealth -- is what we might call the \"Pimco Premium.\" Despite being in a competitive field including giant companies such as Vanguard and Blackrock, Pimco manages to charge more than the industry standard for access to its funds and its separately managed accounts.Why? When competing for business, the firm has had an unbeatable combination of a long history and outstanding long-term results. (At least it did, until recent bad bets on rising interest rates by Gross torpedoed the 1-, 3- and 5-year record of the flagship Total Return Fund.)Pimco also became the go-to company for the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury in many of the credit facilities used to combat the continuing economic fallout from the financial crisis. Pimco's success in the federal government's program to jumpstart consumer lending and a variety of mortgage-backed security programs added more luster to its reputation. Gross even managed to buy up lots of MBS's before the Fed officially announced the programs. Shareholders of the Total Return Fund netted about $10 billion from its mortgage plays.Beyond the sheer size of Pimco's bonuses, there are other aspects of its compensation practices that should give pause to everyone involved in institutional asset management.For one, Pimco has been part of a publicly traded company -- Allianz -- for the past 15 years. Unbeknownst to Allianz's shareholders, employees of one of its business units have been paying themselves these extraordinarily large sums of money.In the U.S., it is hard to imagine $1.5 billion in spending on anything not being disclosed. Almost 16 percent of Pimco's revenue is a \"material\" amount of money that would normally require disclosure in the U.S. But Allianz is a German company, subject to different regulations.Another item worth noticing: Pimco investors represent pension funds, foundations, charitable trusts, 401ks and other retirement accounts. Pimco's enormous, self-paid bonuses come right off of the top of the returns those outside investors might otherwise receive.In a recent Allianz presentation following Gross' departure from Pimco, the firm's new chief executive, Doug Hodge, stated, \"We don't comment on matters of compensation.\"But while Gross may be gone, the high fees and compensation structure at Pimco appear to remain firmly in place. Allianz doesn't seem inclined to change things -- it started a $279 million award program this fall to keep people from following Gross out the door.However, if there is going to be change, it can only come from Pimco's big institutional customers. Why should they pay a Pimco Premium? Pimco's profits are down by 7.9 percent in the third quarter of this year, and the firm saw saw almost $50 billion in outflows last month. Janus, Gross's new home, has managed to attract only about $430 million in new money since he joined.The market for fixed income asset management has never been in greater flux than it is today. The realignment of power among bond managers is only just beginning. If ever there was a moment when investors could demand more competitive fees from their bond managers, it is now.Perhaps it might also be a good time for Pimco itself to consider slicing its fees. Anecdotally, stories abound of Pimco institutional salespeople offering steep one-year fee discounts as a way to retain assets.If I were managing Pimco (even from 6,000 miles away), I would be looking at ways to make those fee reductions more permanent. I bet I even could find close to a billion and a half dollars in savings.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1113], "text": ["$290 million"]}, "id": "533272568535711744"}, {"question": "Ticking time bomb", "context": "At December's Global Diabetes Summit in Berlin, doctors described Type 2 diabetes as \"scarier than HIV and malaria,\" causing more deaths than either.

For mine, it was the death of my grandmother in Kerala.She had been our collective anchor. My grandmother spoke five languages, so that she could communicate with all of her grandchildren, and knew exactly how everyone liked their tea. And everyone liked it differently, all with slightly different amounts of sugar.Upon receiving the unexpected phone call, a sleepless night (pierced by even more phone calls) led to a hazy 40 hours which was broken up by a taxi, two planes, a few chocolate bars, a muted airport greeting and another car journey. By the time I arrived in Calicut, at the house where I had spent my childhood, there were only a few hours left until the funeral.Someone made me a syrupy tea, which boosted my energy, and briefly, my mood. I made myself another two more.Following the funeral, my aunt, who had travelled from America, asked me to take a walk with her. The oppression of the midday sun had subsided slightly, and if we stretched our legs, she said, we would feel better about the tea and sweets we could have when we got back home.Calicut, where I was born, is a city on India's south-west coast. I often thought, with no authority other than nostalgic affection, that it looked like someone had cut roads into the middle of a lush forest. There's significantly less traffic than in many other cities in India. Coconut trees line the streets, as the Arabian Sea sparkles to the west and the Wayanad hills rise in the east.During the 13th Century, Calicut became a major port for the Indian Ocean trade route. Merchants were said to manipulate the monsoon winds to transport spices, cotton - and sugar - from there to the West.And as my aunt and I took our walk, we passed several street vendors. A man was pulping sugar canes into a drink.Feeling slightly light-headed, I was tempted to buy one when something else caught my eye.On the side of the road, under a papaya tree, a one-room shop, that I had been familiar with my whole life, was boarded up.It had belonged to a tailor named Padmanabhan. He had, with his sole sewing machine and thick robust fingers, been the architect of many of my family's fashion choices over the years.He'd cut and shaped my aunt's wedding sari. And my cousin's. He'd made my school uniform. And my niece's and nephew's. He'd disapprovingly made me my first pair of skinny jeans, and pretended not to smile when I told him that people had asked if they were from Paris.\"He died,\" my aunt said, following my gaze.\"Of what, he was only in his 50s, wasn't he?\" I asked, not particularly surprised that the news of our local tailor had reached her in Kansas.\"Type 2 diabetes.

Currently as much as 12% of total health expenditure goes on treating the disease.India has, until it was surpassed by China, been called the diabetes capital of the world, with an estimated 50 million people having Type 2 diabetes. And worryingly, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), that figure will only get worse - to an estimated 87 million people with the disease in the country by 2030.Type 2 DiabetesDiabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar to become too high.At December's Global Diabetes Summit in Berlin, Dr Sanjay Kalra and his colleague Dr Ashok K Das delivered a speech where they called Type 2 diabetes \"a ticking time bomb for India\".'We need to understand and address the psychosocial domain of diabetes - not just the biomedical facts,\" Dr Kalra told me. \"HIV is caused by relatively few high risk behaviours. For diabetes, high risk behaviours impact every sphere of life.\"Indian society frowns upon IV drug use and extramarital sex, but happily encourages unhealthy food and promotes inactivity (cars, escalators, remote control for TV).\"Following our interview, Dr Kalra contacted me via Whatsapp to offer a few extra facts.Did I know that 11 January 2017 marks 95 years since the first insulin injection was administered in Toronto? And urbanisation and stress leads to the disease, although it doesn't discriminate between classes or socioeconomic backgrounds.And could I please remind our readers that reducing sugar and engaging in physical activity like yoga or something fun, like Punjabi folk dancing or bhangra, will go a long way towards reducing the condition.Back on the side of the road in Calicut, I looked at Padmanabhan's boarded-up shop and back towards my aunt.

Now, with its brand-new location in Tribeca, Colicchio says the reconceived kitchen set-up will let the orders come out \"much faster.\" Its sandwiches, like the phenomenal BLT, will take an average of \"five minutes as opposed to 12-13 minutes,\" Colicchio said. The tweaking and rebranding of 'Wichcraft will soon spread to all shops in the chain, and Colicchio said he's hoping to expand 'Wichcraft to other cities in the near future. In the meantime, anyone who won't be visiting in person anytime soon can live vicariously through this must-try BLT recipe, which perfects the classic American sandwich.The BLT is available starting August 1 at the new Tribeca location and all the 'Wichcraft shops. But for anyone trying the recipe at home, there's one crucial secret to making the sandwich come out perfectly, Colicchio says. \"If you\u2019re gonna make a BLT, you have to have great tomatoes, in season and fresh.

The sandwich will vanish too.'Wichcraft BLT Recipe:Makes 4 sandwiches1 pound ripe heirloom or beefsteak tomatoes, sliced 1\u20442-inch thick (Tip: Sit the tomato stem side down on the counter and using a very sharp knife, slice it horizontally to prevent the juices from running out.)1 pound thick-cut bacon4 large leaves of Bibb lettuce8 slices country bread4 tablespoons aioli (see recipe below)Sea salt and freshly ground black pepperFor the BLT:In a heavy skillet, over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until golden brown and crisp on both sides. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Toast the bread on one side only. Evenly spread the aioli on the toasted side of four slices of bread. Place the tomatoes on top of the aioli, making sure the slices don\u2019t overlap and the surface of the bread is covered. Season the tomatoes with sea salt and pepper. Place the bacon over the tomatoes, followed by the lettuce. Close the sandwiches with the remaining four bread slices, toasted side down.

Every neighborhood has its ramen shop at this point. Now, it has overtaken tobacco as the number one currency in US prisons, The Guardian reports.According to a study done by Michael Gibson-Light, a doctoral candidate at the University of Arizona, decreasing quantity and a decline in quality of food served to US prisoners have made the food a commodity. And the noodles are being traded for a lot more than they\u2019re worth. At the prison used for the study, a package of ramen runs for 59 cents at the commissary, but at inmate stores, which are illegal, they can go for much more. A sweatshirt that costs $10.81 can be traded for two packs of ramen. Prisoners also clean each others bunks for packs of ramen, or gamble with it. The change is a signifier of a major problem with nutrition in prisons. \"[Money] doesn\u2019t change unless there\u2019s some drastic change to the value in people using it,\" Gibson-Light said.He attributes ramen\u2019s popularity to the fact that it\u2019s \"easy to get\" and \"high in calories,\" something of value to people who \"spend their days working and exercising.\" They need the energy.Ramen has been popular in prison for a long time.

This is despite the fact that the U.S. added nearly 2.2 million jobs in 2012.\"The big story is that everything was stagnant over the year\" said Economic Policy Institute\u2019s Elise Gould. \"We\u2019re stagnant, and continue to be in a bad place.\"While the economy continues to struggle, residents in the wealthiest states continue to make far more than in the poorest. In 2012, Maryland remained the richest state in the country, with a median household income of $71,221. Mississippi was again the poorest, with an income of $37,095 \u2014 nearly half that of Maryland\u2019s.Despite the addition of jobs nationwide, median incomes remained stagnant in most states and were still generally below their 2008 levels, adjusted for inflation. Sheldon Danziger, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, explained that this has been the nature of the recovery. \"We have an economy that continues to grow, with most of the gains going to the economic elite. I don\u2019t see any bright prospects for the median worker, much less the poor.\"States with lower median incomes generally had much higher rates of poverty than the national rate. All of the 10 states with the lowest median income in 2012 also had among the highest poverty rates in the country. While 15.9% of Americans fell below the poverty line in 2012, nearly one in four Mississippians did.Employment is one of the biggest factors affecting income. In some states with lower unemployment, a higher share of the households had steady income, which bolsters the state\u2019s median. In many of the highest-income states, like New Hampshire, Minnesota and Hawaii, unemployment in 2012 was less than 6%, compared to a national rate of 8.1%.Elise Gould, Director of Health Policy for Economic Policy Institute, explained that unemployment rates can have a significant effect on a state\u2019s household income. \"When we\u2019re talking about average families and poor families, the vast majority of income comes from wages. So it\u2019s about jobs.\" Gould cautioned, however, that unemployment rates do not tell the full story.Unemployment rates, for example, ignore those people who have given up looking for work or accept part-time work. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while 8.1% of American workers were unemployed in 2012, 14.7% were underemployed, meaning they wanted to work full time but could not. This was an increase from roughly 10% in 2008.The types of jobs available in each state also affect income. A review of Census Bureau industry composition data shows that people in most of the states with a higher median income were often more likely to be employed in information, finance, professional and other positions that tend to pay higher salaries. Maryland, the wealthiest state in the country, had the highest percentage of workers in professional, scientific and management positions.At the same time, many of the low-income states had smaller percentages of these professional occupations and higher rates of employment in retail, manufacturing and transportation. The high proportion of manufacturing jobs in low-income states might be surprising, but, explained Danziger, the makeup of the manufacturing industry in the country has changed.\"There\u2019s a difference between unionized auto company workers and non-unionized parts suppliers,\" Danziger said. \"Even when manufacturers haven\u2019t cut wages, they are adopting labor-saving technological change.\"To identify the states with the highest and lowest median household income, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed state data on income from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2012 American Community Survey (ACS). Based on Census treatment, median household income for all years is adjusted for inflation. We also reviewed unemployment data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2012, as well as 2012 ACS data on health insurance coverage, employment and poverty.Here are America's richest states, according to 24/7 Wall St.", "answers": {"answer_start": [511], "text": ["Maryland"]}, "id": "384228827633041408"}, {"question": "This might be the most energizing afternoon routine (it's not more coffee)", "context": "Every day at around 3 p.m., my brain gets weary.

But they weren't.It was invading texts, instant messages, email and even in-person dialogue. The slash was being vocalized where it might otherwise appear in written form, integrated smoothly into audible discussion. Since we aren't yet giving other punctuation the same treatment (\"Hello exclamation point\" still sounds odd), it didn't make much sense.After so much time being delegated to such boring utilitarian functions as dates (\"8/30/2014\") and fractions (\"3/4 cup\"), the humble slash mark seems to be getting a linguistic makeover. Anne Curzan, professor of English at the University of Michigan, described the practice among students in her classroom last year. Since then, Curzan told me in an email, she's been studying examples of slash usage on Twitter. The most common use corresponds most closely to \"and/or,\" but she said a fair number are \"used to connect one idea to another, perhaps meaning something like 'following up' or as something like a spoken semi-colon.\" Still, other examples use the slash as a way to indicate \"truth values for the elements it connects,\" Curzan explained. In other words, saying one thing when what you really mean is the next. Like saying you need to rest when what you're really planning is binge-watching TV.Grammatically speaking, outside of its role as punctuation, the slash also functions as a \"coordinator.\" Coordinators, also called coordinating conjunctions, include \"and,\" \"but,\" \"or\" and other words that function to link independent and dependent clauses.English speakers are pretty comfortable with this idea, as Geoffrey K. Pullum, professor of linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, explained on his blog back in 2010. For example, we might invite our friend/roommate to go see \"Boyhood\" while planning to stuff our purse/backpack/pockets with cheap candy. Our meaning is clear. The person with whom we share a responsibility for rent is also our friend, and whatever discreet container we bring to the theater will help us avoid paying five dollars for a box of Sour Patch Kids. The slash helps us present alternative descriptions. Pullum suggested, however, that it really only makes sense in \"lexical rather than phrasal categories.\"\"With clauses,\" he wrote, \"I think there is no possibility of using it at all: consider 'I think I'm having hallucinations slash someone is playing tricks on me.' Doesn't seem like English at all, does it?\" These days, many English speakers would disagree. Curzan explicitly noted that the slash can now be used to connect full clauses.\"The most interesting implication to me,\" she said, \"is that this coordinator is expanding in use ... and taking on new meanings.\"Usage guidelines are, of course, still very restrictive in formal writing. When the style guides and writers' handbooks I consulted mentioned the slash at all, they called it \"rarely necessary.\" A 1977 edition of Theodore Bernstein's \"The Careful Writer\" referred to the simple \"and/or\" as \"a visual and mental monstrosity that should be avoided.\"Tell that to anyone who considers themselves a \"slash DJ,\" to indicate their interest in the turntable arts outside of a regular nine-to-five. (Writer-slash-DJ. Financial-consultant-slash-DJ. Animal-whisperer-slash-DJ.) Or to Jezebel editor Kara Brown, who described Robin Thicke's \"Paula\" as the singer's \"most recent album slash lame ass attempt at gaining publicity saving his marriage.\"While it'd be difficult to pin down exactly why we started going slash-crazy, it sure seems to correspond nicely with our culture of digital communication. Abbreviated by a lack of time or screen space or both, our technology has allowed instant messaging to flourish, so we might make our always-important thoughts known as quickly as possible.The slash works as a stand-in, whether written or spoken, helping the writer express multiple ideas without going through the trouble of stringing them together using appropriate grammar, or else risking a series of awkwardly short bullet-point sentences. However strange \"I'm going for a run slash walk in the park\" sounds to your ear, it gets across the same basic message as the much wordier alternative, \"I'm going to run in the park but probably do a fair amount of walking, too, because running is hard.\" Using \"slash\" assigned more \"truth value\" to \"walk\" over \"run.\" The slash gives us a perfect opportunity to say two or more things at once like this, especially if one or more of those things is our own unsolicited snarky commentary. (\"Friendship slash rivalry.\" \"Review slash indictment.\")In digital scenarios where time is of the essence, it might seem counterintuitive that typing \"slash\" in the written form would so often take the place of the shorter and equally comprehensible \"and\" or \"or\" if convenience is such a concern. So maybe it speaks, then, to our comfort with digital communication tools like keyboards and touch screens. Typing is second nature to us, and the slash is an almost mindlessly simple way to link our related thoughts. It's a match made in, um, some factory in China.Breakfast slash lunch!

To certain linguists, though, change is actually a great sign. Change means that people are using a language, and using a language keeps it healthy. (There's not a lot of new slang being formed, for example, in Latin.) But everyone owns the English language -- or, maybe, no one does -- and we're not that great at sharing. If it is, in fact, here to stay, some grammar-sticklers will undoubtedly be scandalized at the prospect of a new coordinator, which Curzan called \"a category of words that doesn't often show much creativity and/or admit new members.\"Correction: This story has been amended to reflect the correct spelling of Geoffrey K.

A PC Gamer report mentions that Blizzard is banning cheaters not only once, but several times. This means if you\u2019ve cheated, buying a new copy might not be enough. Several users are reporting that Blizzard banned them again after they bought a new copy. A few even tried buying a 3rd copy and yet they got banned within 24 hours of playing the game.Blizzard\u2019s even taken a more brutal stance in China. The company, along with its partner NetEase, has ensured it bans anyone stupid enough to try cheating in the game. It unleashed a massive 1572 person ban wave earlier today. The company went a step ahead as far as savagery is concerned and revealed all the names it had banned due to cheating.The moral of this story is clear as day, and it\u2019s that you should not even think about cheating while playing Overwatch.

Photo via GettyReports on the income inequality gap and the separate lives of the wealthy and the poor have become depressingly rote. The rich are not like you or me: They can buy their way into exclusive clubs, special social networks, even elitist sex parties. The poorest people in America are now on average not making enough to meet their basic needs\u2014that sounds pretty bad, but can I interest you in a $700 juicer?In that context, the publication, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), of a new study that looks at income and life expectancy after age 40 contains no bombshells. The report, covered widely by the New York Times and pretty much every other outlet on Monday, drills down into how income and longevity correlate. The richest 1 percent of men lives, on average, 15 years longer than the poorest 1 percent; for women that gap is ten years. But the ability of money and the things it buys\u2014access to better medical care, leisure time, healthier food\u2014to stave off death is well known. The big finding from Stanford economist Raj Chetty and his seven co-authors is not that rich people live longer, it's that the life expectancies of Americans in poverty varies wildly depending on where they live.Here's how the Times summarizes it: \"The poor in some cities\u2014big ones like New York and Los Angeles, and also quite a few smaller ones like Birmingham, Ala.\u2014live nearly as long as their middle-class neighbors or have seen rising life expectancy in the 21st century. But in some other parts of the country, adults with the lowest incomes die on average as young as people in much poorer nations like Rwanda, and their life spans are getting shorter.\"For the wealthy, it doesn't matter where they live\u2014they seem to have the access to the same sorts of advantages wherever they go. \"It is as if the top income percentiles belong to one world of elite, wealthy US adults,\" wrote Nobel Prize\u2013winning economist Angus Deaton in an article that accompanied the study in JAMA, \"whereas the bottom income percentiles each belong to separate worlds of poverty, each unhappy and unhealthy in its own way.\"The obvious question, then, is what makes those individual islands of scarcity more or less healthy than other communities? That's beyond the scope of the paper, but it's clear that the answer isn't simply that some places have fewer or worse doctors. \"The JAMA paper found that several measures of access to medical care had no clear relationship with longevity among the poor,\" noted the Times. \"But there were correlations with smoking, exercise, and obesity.\"The places where the poor lived the longest include New York and San Francisco\u2014rich cities that can afford to provide a lot of services and have proactive public health departments. San Francisco was a pioneer in smoking bans; New York abolished trans fats. Poor people in and around Birmingham had a surprisingly high life expectancy, but there too there has been an investment in health services, according to the Times, and banned smoking in restaurants and other places in 2012.Any study like this comes with some caveats. One reason poor people in major metropolises have longer life expectancies could be that they have higher proportions of immigrants, who tend to live longer than native-born Americans. Some people have lower incomes because their poor health damaged their earnings power, not the other way round. And the authors adjusted the statistics for race and ethnicity in order to correct for racial differences in life expectancy (for instance, black people generally live less long than whites), something they've been criticized for. \"Social marginalization is not reducible to single variables,\" wrote Steven Woolf and Jason Purnell in a JAMA editorial. \"Race/ethnicity is inseparable from the economic consequences and stress associated with segregation, past and present marginalization in the distribution of resources, structural racism, persistent poverty, and violence.\"But if we accept the broader findings here, there seems to be almost a trickle-down affect when it comes to long life and health. In poverty-pocked areas in the Midwest and the South, poor people die sooner; in other words, in places that lack the services and infrastructure that wealthy big cities usually provide, people are less healthy.\"Health is about more than healthcare,\" Woolf and Purnell wrote. Good schools, crime-free neighborhoods, childhoods spared the trauma of family dysfunction, and other factors all contribute to whether someone is happy and healthy as an adult, or whether they're trapped in that old cycle of poverty begetting stress begetting illness begetting more poverty.Seen from this angle, inequality looks like not just a matter of unfair numbers but a public health problem. New York's example suggests at least the bones of a solution: higher taxes to fund a local government that develops policies to discourage people from eating crappy food and smoking. In many ways, this is a punishingly unfair city, but when it comes to having a healthy populace, it seems like other places could benefit from some New York values.", "answers": {"answer_start": [54], "text": ["Have a Bunch of Money"]}, "id": "721323075246112769"}, {"question": "Nerd Wins Scrabble Championship With Word You\u2019ve Never Heard Of", "context": "Image: GettyAs you probably already know, the World Scrabble Championship 2016 final took place on Saturday.

The trip was full of surprises: lizards in our suitcase, a couple days on islands with no Wi-Fi (and no English), and days spent doing yoga on the beach to round it all out. But what was perhaps the most baffling part of the whole thing was the one question I was asked again and again from fellow moms: \"Who is watching your kids?\"If I were a single mother, the question might be valid. But as a married mom whose husband has an equal hand in raising our brood to adulthood, it's quite astonishing to be asked that question again and again. No, I didn't hire a babysitter (at least not for the nights or weekends). No, I didn't leave them with the grandparents. My husband was with them.Why would anyone find this shocking?OK, so it's true. The list of daily tasks for the care and upkeep of three children is seemingly endless \u2014 from the moment they leap out of bed between 7 and 7:15 to the moment they hit the pillows around 8 or 8:30. The 2-year-old must be changed, washed, brushed, soothed, fed, held, rocked, amused, and watched multiple times a day. My 9-year-old and 7-year-old have homework to supervise, friend dramas to negotiate, permission slips to sign, and activities to attend. They dress and bathe themselves, but someone must be vigilant at all times to keep them on track.Most PopularTruth be told, I work part-time, so the bulk of the child duties does fall to me. But my husband knows the score. He is responsible for preschool drop-off every morning. He picks up from gymnastics every Wednesday, and takes charge of math homework and making sure our son reads for exactly 20 minutes every night. He changes diapers and also has access to the giant family calendar that hangs in our mudroom to track everyone's doctors appointments, playdates, birthday parties, and after-school activities. I might be behind the wheel mostly, but he's always next to me in the front seat reading the map.So why the question?Our society is full of all kinds of families, but our leafy suburb just outside of New York City often feels like there is one kind: traditional two-parent homes where one parent (usually the dad) works full-time while the long-suffering mother does everything with her kids. When I went on a business trip for a week two years ago, a friend confided in me: \"My husband wouldn't even be able to pack a lunch if I left.\"Why are we accepting this as normal?My husband regularly goes to California for work. Last year, there were long periods where he left every Tuesday and returned on Friday afternoon. Not once, in all those weeks of lonely nights and busy mornings, did anyone ask him who was watching the kids. It's obvious, right? Daddies get to go out in the world. Mommies stay home. Mommy has it all under control. And I do. Mostly. But it's not easy when one spouse travels. A job that really belongs to two people suddenly falls to one. It's a fact my husband understands well.This is why I needed a vacation. Alone.\"How long are you gone again?\" he texted me on Wednesday, six days into my 11-day trip.I had to laugh. But that is all I did. Because I knew that back home, even though he felt like he was drowning, he would doggy paddle his way back to shore somehow. My toddler's cot sheet might not get washed for preschool. And my son might get a B on a spelling test instead of his usual A, because my husband doesn't ride him as hard as I would've if I was home. But my children would be clean, well-fed, and (mostly) smiling when I got back. And they were.My husband is not a babysitter. He is a parent just like me. Being alone with the kids is a challenge even for the most organized and dedicated among us. But that doesn't make Daddy less capable of it.Upon my return, a friend said she could \"never do what you did.\" Her husband wouldn't be able to keep it together. Not without massive amounts of help. And that's exactly the reason to go. Kids need to know their daddies can care for them as well.

His plans were accelerated after unnamed scouts at the Senior Bowl in January were asking about his sexuality.\"At the Senior Bowl, it was the first question I got from the scouts almost every time,\" one of Sam's agents, Joe Barkett, told Outsports. \"He didn't feel there was an agenda behind the question other than trying to determine if the word on the Internet was true. \"They would ask about spending time with him, were there girls around? Who is his girlfriend? They didn't ask that about another client, Tom Hornsey. They only asked it about Michael.\"Wanting to come out on his own terms, Sam altered his initial timetable, eventually speaking with ESPN and The New York Times on Sunday. After the news broke, Sam took to Twitter to thanks those who helped him in coming out.I want to thank everybody for their support and encouragement,especially @espn, @nytimes and @nfl. I am proud to tell my story to the world! \u2014 Michael Sam (@MikeSamFootball) February 10, 2014While Sam was thankful for the support he received, Athlete Ally Youth Programs Director Akil Patterson was among those noting the impact that this pioneering decision could have on others.\"Having played Division I football as a closeted gay man, I recognize the game-changing potential here for athletes everywhere, \" Patterson, a former standout offensive lineman at the University of Maryland, said in a statement. \"If Michael Sam can navigate this transition into the NFL as an out man of color, it will open doors for young people everywhere, particularly in football. More athletes will feel comfortable being true to themselves at a younger age and that will translate into better performance on the field and in the classroom.

The 35-year-old was entering free agency and did not find a new team for the 2013-2014 season.

In fact, there are 22 countries where women have far more parity with their male counterparts than women do in the U.S.The Global Gender Gap Report ranks 136 countries (which collectively contain over 93 percent of the world's population) based on 14 indicators used to measure the size of a nation's gender gap in four key areas:1. Economic participation and opportunity, which includes female labor force participation, wage equality and the percentage of women in high-ranking, highly-skilled jobs.2. Educational attainment, which looks at female literacy, and women's access to and enrollment in both basic and higher education.3. Political empowerment, which examines the number of women holding political office as well as the number of female heads of state over the last 50 years.4. Health and survival, which is measured by comparing female and male life expectancy and mortality rates.Each country out of the 136 is assigned a score between 1 (total equality) and 0 (total inequality) for each of the 14 indicators. The scores are then averaged to determine the overall rankings. According to the report's authors, the index scores represent the \"percentage of the gap that has been closed between women and men.\"This year the United States ranked 23rd and received a score of 0.7392, nearly the same as in 2012 when the U.S. ranked 22nd with a score of .7373. Unfortunately, our ranking and score have both decreased since 2011. That year, the U.S. was ranked 17th, just behind the United Kingdom and just ahead of Canada, with a score of .7412.Where the U.S. really seems to falter is not in educational attainment -- we have near-perfect gender equality when it comes to enrollment in primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions. And though we ranked an abysmal 67th when it came to closing the wage gap, overall the U.S. ranked 6th for economic participation. But the U.S. has a serious gender issue when it comes to politics, receiving a score of .159 for overall political empowerment, mostly because we have so few women in legislative and ministerial positions. For example, women make up just 18.3 percent of the 113th Congress.And of course, this report does not account for everything that makes up the quality of a woman's life. For example, it is illegal in both Nicaragua and the Philippines for women to terminate a pregnancy.As always, these rankings show us the places where we have made incredible progress when it comes to gender parity in the U.S. -- and the areas where there is still much more work to be done.Here are 22 countries that are more gender equal than the United States:1.

Guess who is.", "context": "L ast year, ast year, Tesco\u2019s food waste mountain amounted to 59,400 tonnes . If you\u2019re finding that figure hard to envisage, it\u2019s the equivalent of 119m meals, and an increase of 4% on the year before. From this we can deduce that Tesco\u2019s voluble commitment to reducing its edible detritus has yet to yield results. But is Tesco any worse in this respect than any other supermarket chain? Probably wisely, the others don\u2019t publish their waste figures, but let\u2019s just assume that if they had a better story to tell us, we\u2019d already know all about it.Tesco\u2019s waste tally is certainly grotesque, but PR executives expert in techniques for smoothing over corporate difficulties would doubtless applaud the masterly way Tesco deflected criticism. On the day that his chain\u2019s depressing results were published, chief executive Dave Lewis addressed a food industry summit where he exhorted food manufacturers to do more to reduce their waste across the supply chain.After deftly passing the waste ball back to his supply base, Lewis reprised a favourite supermarket refrain: blame the consumer. \"While the majority of food waste arises from the home, industry recognises the need to lead by example.\" There you have the dramatis personae in Tesco\u2019s food waste script: profligate consumers, suppliers who earn a \"must work harder\" rating, and enlightened Tesco, leading the vanguard in the national war on waste.Just in case you aren\u2019t finding the plot line 100% credible, a further emotional strand is woven in: Tesco promises to redistribute all its unsold edible food to charities from 2017. Putting a gloss on your waste problem by repackaging it as a food poverty solution is a tactic increasingly deployed by our major supermarkets. Ideally, from a supermarket PR point of view, the term \"food poverty\" would appear in every headline that contains \"supermarket food waste\", for that allows our giant retailers to bask in the role of philanthropists who use their corporate might for the common good. It places a halo of saintliness around all their business activities.But a waste prevention strategy should never be confused with a poverty reduction strategy. Crumbs from the rich man\u2019s table is a shallow, and too easily self-aggrandising response to the unacceptable reality that millions of fellow citizens can\u2019t afford to eat good, fresh food. What\u2019s more, the red herring of food poverty draws attention further away from one essential fact about supermarkets we must digest if we are ever to make any progress: waste is hard-wired into the supermarket system.When the supermarkets began colonising the UK grocery market in the early 1980s, they appeared to be a newer, more efficient way of feeding the nation. They promised vast economies of scale by virtue of their collective buying power and state-of-the-art distribution logistics that would bring every agricultural product on the planet to our shelves, 365 days a year. This precision shopping model, we were assured, would produce dividends for consumers in the form of lower prices and more convenient shopping. Who needs parades of small, independent shops when chains can feed us so much more efficiently, and for less?Once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese; now we live in dread of food poisoningFour decades on, it\u2019s becoming obvious that supermarkets are incapable of delivering this promise. Why? They are retail dinosaurs, locked into a system that\u2019s riddled with problems.One such glaring issue is food waste. Far from discouraging it, the supermarket business model actively begets it.There aren\u2019t, to my knowledge, any robust statistics on levels of food waste in British households before the supermarket era, but I\u2019d hazard a guess that they were much lower than they are now.Our rubbish bins really started filling up when, instead of shopping for a little, as was needed, every day or two, we were persuaded to adopt the one-stop supermarket shopping trip. Theoretically, armed with a list, we could buy all the food we needed for a week. Nowadays, supermarket online ordering makes that even easier to do. Just press the same-as-last-week option. So supermarkets egg us on to overlook what we already have and to buy much more than we need. They encourage us to hazard a weekly guess about what we\u2019ll consume, rather than focusing on what\u2019s in our fridges and larders day-to-day.If the untouched remnants of last week\u2019s order are stacking up in the fridge when the supermarket van arrives at our door, most people will consign them to the bin, schooled to believe, thanks to supermarket use by and best before dates, that judging freshness is best left to distant experts. Once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese, now we live in dread of poisoning. Better safe than sorry, surely?But sell-by dates \u2013 the progenitor of use by and best before \u2013 were introduced by supermarkets as stock rotation tools, to help clunky, mammoth chains keep tabs on the unprecedented amount of product passing through their system, not primarily as safeguards against food poisoning.Undoubtedly, certain foods sold by supermarkets do pose a very real risk to health. Around two thirds of their raw chickens are contaminated with potentially lethal campylobacter at the point of sale, even though they are well within their use-by dates. Yet again supermarkets point the finger of blame at the stupid, sloppy home cook who fails to slay the bacteria through thorough cooking, rather than eradicating infection at their factory farms.And don\u2019t forget that supermarkets have actively undermined our national food handling experience and skill by telling us that we\u2019re too \"time poor\" to cook from scratch, largely because it is much more profitable for them to sell us value-added, processed foods whose apparent freshness is validated by reassuring dates. The bottom line here is that such dates are absolutely no guarantee that food is truly fresh or safe, yet they shape our daily decisions about what we eat and what we bin.Battalions of quangos, non-governmental organisations, government agencies and charities see supermarkets as allies in the war on food waste, but in reality, they are a huge part of the problem. If we are to stop waste at source, we must look to and learn from the burgeoning grassroots initiatives that aim to relocalise and scale down our food chain.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1718], "text": ["supermarkets"]}, "id": "4ospl7"}, {"question": "Is the NES Classic Edition available for pre-order?", "context": "Considering how popular Nintendo\u2019s little blast from the past is likely to be, this is a pretty important question.Not many video game hardware projects are absolute no-brainers, but the Mini NES Classic Edition \u2014 officially going by the unwieldy name Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition \u2014 checks off all the boxes.

This story, originally published on his 70th birthday on January 7, 2012, is being resurfaced to explain how he beat the odds and lived so long with the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).Stephen Hawking turns 70 on Sunday, beating the odds of a daunting diagnosis by nearly half a century.The famous theoretical physicist has helped to bring his ideas about black holes and quantum gravity to a broad public audience. For much of his time in the public eye, though, he has been confined to a wheelchair by a form of the motor-neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). And since 1985 he has had to speak through his trademark computer system\u2014which he operates with his cheek\u2014and have around-the-clock care.But his disease seems hardly to have slowed him down. Hawking spent 30 years as a full professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge. And he is currently the director of research at the school's Center for Theoretical Cosmology.But like his mind, Hawking's illness seems to be singular. Most patients with ALS\u2014also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, for the famous baseball player who succumbed to the disease\u2014are diagnosed after the age of 50 and die within five years of their diagnosis. Hawking's condition was first diagnosed when he was 21, and he was not expected to see his 25th birthday.Why has Hawking lived so long with this malady when so many other people die so soon after diagnosis? We spoke with Leo McCluskey, an associate professor of neurology and medical director of the ALS Center at the University of Pennsylvania, to find out more about the disease and why it has spared Hawking and his amazing brain.What is ALS\u2014and is there more than one form of it?ALS, which is also known as a motor-neuron disease\u2014and colloquially as Lou Gehrig's disease in the U.S.\u2014is a neurodegenerative disease. Each muscle is controlled by motor neurons that reside in the brain in the frontal lobe. These are controlled electrically and are synaptically connected to motor neurons that reside lower down in the brain\u2014as well as motor neurons that reside in the spinal cord. The guys in the brain are called the upper motor neurons, and the guys in the spine are called the lower motor neurons. The disease causes weakness of either upper motor neurons or lower motor neurons or both.It's been known for quite some time that there are variants of ALS. One is referred to as progressive muscular atrophy, or PMA. It appears to be an isolated illness of the lower motor neurons. However, pathologically, if you do an autopsy of a patient, they will have evidence of deterioration of upper motor neurons.There is also primary lateral sclerosis\u2014PLS\u2014and clinically it looks like an isolated upper motor-neuron disorder. However, pathologically they also have lower motor-neuron disorder.The other classic syndrome is called progressive baldor palsy\u2014or progressive supranuclear palsy\u2014which is weakening of cranial muscles, like the tongue, face and swallowing muscles. But it pretty much always spreads to limb muscles.Those are the four classic motor-neuron disorders that have been described. And it was thought for quite some time that these disorders were limited to motor neurons. It's now clear that that's not true. It's now well recognized that 10 percent of these patients can develop degeneration in another part of the brain, such as other parts of the frontal lobe that don't contain the motor neurons or the temporal lobe. So some of these patients can actually develop dementia, called frontal-temporal lobe dementia.One of the misconceptions about ALS is that it's only a motor-neuron disease, and that's not true.What has Stephen Hawking's case shown about the disease?One thing that is highlighted by this man's course is that this is an incredibly variable disorder in many ways. On average people live two to three years after diagnosis. But that means that half the people live longer, and there are people who live for a long, long time.Life expectancy turns on two things: the motor neurons running the diaphragm\u2014the breathing muscles. So the common way people die is of respiratory failure. And the other thing is the deterioration of swallowing muscles, and that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. If you don't have these two things, you could potentially live for a long time\u2014even though you're getting worse. What's happened to him is just astounding. He's certainly an outlier.Has he lived so long because he got the disease when he was young and had the juvenile-onset type?Juvenile-onset is diagnosed in the teenage years, and I don't know enough about his course to say. But it's probably something similar to juvenile-onset disorder, which is something that progresses very, very, very slowly. I have patients in my clinic who were diagnosed in their teens and are still alive in their 40s, 50s or 60s. But not having ever examined him or taken a history, it's a little hard for me to say.He's a very good example of the sparing of the non-motor parts of the brain that can occur.How frequent are these cases of very slow-progressing forms of ALS?I would say probably less than a few percent.How much do you think Stephen Hawking's longevity has been due to the excellent care that he has received versus the biology of his particular form of ALS?It's probably a little bit of both. I just know him from television, so I don't know what kind of interventions he's had. If he really isn't on a ventilator, then it's his biology\u2014it's the biology of his form of the neurodegenerative disease that determines how long he will live. For trouble swallowing you can elect to have a feeding tube placed, which basically takes malnutrition and dehydration off the table. But mostly it's about the biology of the disease.Hawking obviously has quite the active mind, and previous statements that he has made seem to indicate he has a pretty positive mental outlook, despite his condition. Is there any evidence that lifestyle and psychological well-being do much to help with patients' outcomes? Or is the disease usually too quick for that to make a difference?I don't believe that adds to longevity.ALS still doesn't have a cure. What have we learned about the disease recently that might help us find one\u2014or at least better treatments?Beginning in 2006 it became clear that like a lot of other neurodegenerative diseases, ALS was determined by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain. Ten percent of ALS is genetic and based on a gene mutation. I'm sure there are also at-risk genes for ALS, but there are now multiple genes that have been identified as potentially causing the disease. Each one of them are interesting in that they lead to the accumulation of different proteins in the brain. Knowing specific genes gives us particular mechanisms in the brain, and would potentially give us targets for therapies. But none of this has given us any robust therapies yet.What does Stephen Hawking's case mean for people who have the disease?It's just an incredible, incredible example of the variability of the disease\u2014and the hope for patients who have it that they could also live a long life.

After being heralded as \"the creation of a near-perfect blue pigment,\" this coincidental eureka moment is now being manufactured for artists\u2019 brushes.This burst of blue came about when scientists at Oregon State University (OSU) heated manganese oxide, along with other chemicals, to over 1,200\u00b0C (2,000\u00b0F). Although the scientists were actually looking at manganese oxide for some of its electronic properties, one of their reactions inadvertently birthed a new pigment: the catchily named \"YInMn blue.\"The findings of the original study were published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\"Basically, this was an accidental discovery,\" said Mas Subramanian, a Milton Harris professor of materials science in the OSU Department of Chemistry, in a statement. \"Our work had nothing to do with looking for a pigment.He added: \"Then one day a graduate student who is working on the project was taking samples out of a very hot furnace while I was walking by, and it was blue, a very beautiful blue.

Nighttime exposure to artificial light -- which for the great majority of us happens without much thought or awareness -- disrupts the body's circadian rhythm, altering the 24-hour biological clock that controls our sleep-wake cycle. In addition to wreaking havoc with sleep, disruptions to circadian rhythms also have been associated with a number of serious diseases, including cancer, diabetes, depression and heart disease.In particular, research in recent years has shown that blue wavelength light is especially harmful to circadian rhythm function. Studies have shown that blue wavelength light has uniquely harmful effects on humans and suppresses melatonin levels more vigorously than other light wavelengths. Unfortunately, many energy-efficient light sources produce high concentrations of blue light. Blue light is emitted by electronic devices, energy-efficient light bulbs, and other common light sources.Research investigating blue-light blocking -- most often in the form of goggles that filter out this particular wavelength of light -- has shown promise. A new study of cataract patients indicates that artificial lens implants can help improve sleep. Scientists at China's Sichuan University studied the effects of blue-light blocking artificial lenses implanted during cataract surgery. The study involved 40 patients who required surgery for cataracts in both eyes. Cataract surgery commonly involves removal of the eye's damaged lens and insertion of an artificial lens. Cataracts are a common condition among older adults -- approximately 60 percent of people over the age of 60 experience cataracts. The study subjects -- 26 women and 14 men, with an average age of 74 -- were given artificial lenses with blue-light blocking capability. Researchers assessed patients sleep quality before surgery and again two months after surgery. They found patients' sleep had improved significantly across several measures:Patients were sleeping more during the night.Their sleep quality had improved.Their levels of daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness had diminished.The number of subjects who met the criteria for \"poor sleepers\" had decreased.Lens replacement surgery is necessary for cataract patients. But there are other, less-invasive ways to filter out blue-light that are also being investigated by sleep scientists. Research has shown the benefits to sleep of manipulating and controlling exposure to blue light:A study of 20 adults who wore either blue-light blocking or ultraviolet-light blocking glasses for three hours before sleep found that both sleep quality and mood improved among those in the group who wore blue-light blocking glasses, compared to the ultraviolet-light blocking group.Shift workers are at especially high risk for circadian rhythm disruptions because of their non-traditional schedules. In a study by scientists at Quebec's Universite Laval, nightshift workers used blue-light blocking glasses at or near the end of their overnight shifts for four weeks. At the end of study period, their overall sleep amounts increased, as did their sleep efficiency.While nighttime exposure to blue wavelength light is damaging to circadian rhythms, exposure to blue light isn't always detrimental. Daytime exposure to blue light can stimulate alertness and help sleep later on. A study of 94 office workers found that daytime exposure to blue light during work hours resulted in improvements both to sleep and to daytime functioning, compared to exposure to white light. Subjects who were exposed to blue light experienced improvements to daytime alertness, mood, and concentration. These subjects also experienced decreases in daytime sleepiness and they slept better at night.This area of research is critically important, and I expect we will see a great deal more investigation into the effects of blue wavelength light on sleep and health. But you don't need special goggles or eye lens implants to protect your circadian rhythms and your sleep from the negative effects of artificial light. Here are some low-tech suggestions that can help you:Limit exposure to artificial light in the hours before bed. The last 1-2 hours before bed should be a time of winding down and preparing for sleep. Decreasing your exposure to light is an important part of this process. You don't have to sit in a pitch-black room, but you should think about beginning to limit your exposure to bright lights, whether from your computer screen or your television. Reading under moderate lamplight is fine. If you're using a tablet to read, bring the screen's brightness level down. Make the last 60 minutes of your bedtime ritual electronics-free -- and keep electronic gadgets and devices out of the bedroom altogether.Get light exposure during the day. Daytime exposure to light -- both sunlight and artificial light -- can help strengthen circadian rhythms and boost daytime alertness, leaving you better prepared to sleep when the time comes.If you need access to light in the middle of the night, use small nightlights. Rather than switching on hallway or bathroom lights -- and flooding your system with melatonin-suppressing light -- use low-illumination night lights to guide you when you need to get up in the dark.Being aware of the effects of nighttime exposure to light and making some basic changes to bedtime routines can go a long way toward getting you the darkness you need to sleep well, even in this ever-bright modern age.", "answers": {"answer_start": [644], "text": ["blue"]}, "id": "382166003905331200"}, {"question": "The saddest/happiest show on TV is...", "context": "Last season on \"Parenthood,\" viewers went on an emotional rollercoaster when Kristina Braverman was diagnosed with breast cancer.

What He Found Inside? Astonishing!", "context": "Investigating strange cries emanating from a West Virginia dumpster sounds like the start of a horror movie. Chances are, there would be nothing inside one of those that would make your day any better. But James Butler might disagree with you there.James was strolling through Coonskin Park, a riverside sliver of nature located in Kanawha County, West Virginia, when he heard a strange noise coming from one of the dumpsters there. Curiosity piqued, he investigated, only to discover something that had him fumbling for his camera...Retired West Virginia police officer and aviation enthusiast James Butler heard strange cries coming from a Charleston, West Virginia, dumpster on Tuesday, August 11, 2015. Curious, he investigated the sounds.Right away, he noticed two things. Five raccoons were trapped inside the Coonskin Park trash receptacle, and one of those raccoons was like nothing he'd ever seen before.As to how they got stuck, James said, \"The dumpster had apparently been emptied and the garbage level was low and the raccoons couldn\u2019t reach the top to get back out.\" And that rare raccoon?He didn't really look like like his family members\u2014or like any raccoon James had ever seen! This trashmonger was an albino raccoon, an incredibly rare specimen according to the Indiana Division of Fish and Wildlife. How rare, exactly?The organization stated only one in 750,000 raccoons inherit the albino gene, a mutation that means the animal creates no melanin and therefore has no pigmentation. Stunned by his find, James didn't forget the real trouble at hand\u2014these raccoons were stuck.Thinking quickly, James fabricated a little something to help the raccoons escape their trash pit prison: a wood plank. He leaned it on the inside of the dumpster, and the raccoons could use it like a ramp! They were free\u2014but that brought consequences.The albino raccoon had been \"a well-kept secret\" in Coonskin Park, according to Rodney Jones, chief of Kanawha's Park Police Department. And once James shared his pictures online, Officer Jones feared it would become the subject of the public's curious cameras...\"Now that the albino\u2019s getting publicity,\" Rodney said, \"I figure people will start looking to see if they can find it around the park.\" And people searching for a wild animal\u2014with a wild animal's instincts\u2014can be trouble.\"We try to tell people with animals to keep their distance and don\u2019t try to feed them,\" he said after emphasizing that raccoons carry deadly diseases. \"I'd really hate to see an animal like that be destroyed because of someone\u2019s curiosity or stupidity.\"Worse, the albino raccoon's appearance can make it a \"prize\" in the eyes of some people. Something special that needs to be captured or owned. Such was the case with a four-year-old albino raccoon in Georgia...For part of her early life, Isis the albino raccoon had a miserable existence. Because of her unique look, someone captured her and locked her in a small, wire cage, intending to use her for a taxidermy project. Luckily, there was good news in store for her...The Georgia Department of Natural Resources rescued Isis and delivered the raccoon to Maxine Rainey, below, director of the Georgia animal sanctuary, A New Hope. But both the sanctuary and the department of natural resources feared she was a lost cause...Understandably, Isis was aggressive. Human touch scared her, and she lashed out at anyone trying to help her. \"Since she was described as so aggressive,\" Maxine said, \"we were just going to hold her for a couple of days.\" But then what?When Maxine accepted the albino raccoon, she gave the poor animal a look over: she had urine burns, smelled horrendous, was obese, losing hair, and had sores all over her feet. No wonder she was aggressive. Maxine, though, had hope for the poor animal.She sat in the enclosure with the animal that, by all accounts, should've been trying to tear her head off if she got too close. But amazingly, that didn't happen.\"I'd been going through some stuff in my personal life, Maxine said, \"and I was kind of having a sad day, so I...sat by her and she came right up to me....she came up and sniffed me, and put her little hands in my hand.\" From there, the raccoon's life only got better.\"She's so gentle,\" Maxine said. \"She spent the last couple days glued to my side, sleeping on my lap, having me carry her around...I just saw a complete 180-degree flip in her personality the minute she was exposed to some kindness.\"For a raccoon once deemed so aggressive she had to be kept away from other raccoons at the facility, that's a pretty glowing review! But the story of Isis only underscored the worry of Rodney Jones, the chief of Kanawha\u2019s Park Police Department...People like James Butler are often fascinated with animals that are different and unique, but it's important to remember they're wild animals\u2014potentially dangerous and capable of love and affection.

The site spits out a seemingly never-ending bucket list of things we absolutely must do before we die: places to see, books to read, urinals to pee in. And as we all inch closer to our imminent deaths, BuzzFeed creates more and more of these articles, making it seemingly impossible to accomplish all of these things before we kick the can.If you're as young and bored as I am, though, you might wonder: Could you pull it off? Could you actually check everything off the BuzzFeed bucket list, and if so, how long would it take? A little while ago, I set out to find out for myself. Here's how I did it:First, I had to compile all of the lists BuzzFeed has published in its \"Before You Die\" format. At the time I filed this story, there were 182 lists. These ranged from appreciating the little things in life (like watching the sunset) to full-blown adventures (like going to South Africa's version of Burning Man). BuzzFeed writers also seem obsessed with food, since practically every other list is about stuffing your face with 21 amazing Aussie burgers or the ten best New Orleans po-boys or the 15 best cheese toasties in London.Next, I cataloged each task on each of the 182 lists. There are over a thousand individual tasks.On Motherboard: Counting the Hours I've Spent on the InternetNext, I calculated the time it would take to complete each of the tasks. This is where it all got slightly more complicated, since the time it would take to do most of these things is highly individualized. Eating fish and chips, for example\u2014how long does that take the average person? If you were really vying for time, you could probably scarf some down in five minutes, but I'd much prefer to spend an hour savoring of a nice, greasy plate. And what if the restaurant was really busy and it took a long time for your server to bring the fish and chips to you? I settled on 30 minutes for eating fish and chips, as well as the other food-related tasks.Other tasks required a fair amount of research, like hiking the Camino de Santiago, otherwise known as St. James' path, between Spain and France, which is less like a path and more like a pilgrimage. The trail is nearly 500 miles long. According to the trail's official website, it takes four to six weeks to complete. I decided to allot 30 days to complete the trail, even though the website also noted that you would need to hike 18 miles per day without any rest days to finish the trail in that time, which seems completely insane.I repeated this process for every single task on Buzzfeed's lists. Again, there are over a thousand individual tasks.Here is a time table showing a small sample of the time I allotted for certain tasks:Some of the lists contained fast, easy tasks that be completed entirely from your couch\u2014like this one, which requires you to look at 20 pictures of miniature pigs before you die\u2014but for most of them, you have to travel. Some of the lists, like the Five Highest Places to Visit Before You Die, require you to jet-set from the Haiku Stairs of Oahu, Hawaii to the Petronas Towers of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to the Taihang Mountains in China. In order to accomplish all of the tasks most effectively, you would need to travel the world. So I decided to calculate the travel time that it would take to work your way around the world, in an order most efficient for accomplishing each of the BuzzFeed tasks.I decided to begin my hypothetical bucket-list journey in Boston, where I live, and work my way west through North America. I would visit 36 states in the United States and stop in Canada and Mexico along the way. Then onto the Dominican Republic to explore the three shipwrecks of Bayahibe, followed by stops at Turks and Caicos, and Belize. Some stops later, I'd spend 175 hours and ten minutes flying from country to country in Europe, stopping in Estonia to see the beech tree in Hiiumaa before taking a quick ten-minute flight over to Finland to go to the Kontula indoor skatepark in Helsinki. I'd make my way over to Turkey to swim in the crystal blue mineral waters of the Pamukkale Springs in Hierapolis and then pop over to Jordan to grab a drink at the Cave Bar in Petra.I whittled the travel time down to one-hour flights over borders, stopping in some countries for only a few minutes to visit a bakery or for a few hours to watch a sports game. In total, the round-the-world trip would take 26 days in travel time alone, and would include 108 countries.The last thing I calculated was sleep time. I figured a person would be fairly tired after spending months on end climbing mountains, reading plays, and visiting museums every day, so I allotted the doctor-recommended eight hours per night. I really enjoy sleeping, so this is painful for me to even imagine, but when you're racing to finish an extensive bucket-list in the fastest amount possible, I suppose luxuriating in the REM cycle shouldn't be a priority. I also factored in how long it took me to calculate the trip\u2014around 40 hours in total\u2014and how long it would take to actually book the flights, hotels, and day-trips, which would be possibly twice that.In conclusion\u2014drumroll, please\u2014I determined it would take 1,448.7 days to do everything that BuzzFeed says you need to do before you die. That's 207 weeks, or just shy of four years.I'll repeat that some of the timing calculations were arbitrary. You could get stuck in a restaurant with poor service and it might take double the time to eat your fish and chips, or you could arrive somewhere like the Trinity Church on King George Island in Antarctica and decide it was too boring to stay the full hour. Your flights could get delayed, or you could get food poisoning at one of the restaurants and choose to bail on the next day's activities. If you got the timing wrong, you might miss the small window when all 39 Christmas markets on the list are open, or arrive at the Mendenhall Ice Caves in Juneau, Alaska, to find that they have all melted.But if you planned it just right and you had the time, money, and stamina to accomplish everything on the list, then you could definitely do it.That said, I'm not sure why anyone would want to. There are a lot of things on that list that I, personally, have no interest in doing. Why should I visit 39 different Christmas markets across Europe? I mean, I'm sure they're beautiful and each have nice hot chocolate and giant, neon candy canes, but what's the harm in not seeing all 39 of them? Is it really worth the hours it would take to learn all 44 of these air guitar songs? Would I really be a lesser person for not having visited these 19 penis-shaped objects around the world?I'm not saying I wouldn't do it. If someone offered me the chance to travel the world and see some of the coolest things this Earth has to offer, I'd be hard pressed to say no. Of course, I'll probably die before that happens.

The supplies are no longer new and shiny, and more than a few have met their untimely trash can demise. Used and broken crayons look better in that circular file than in pencil boxes. Glue sticks that still have some in them but are not the easiest to use just aren\u2019t worth it anymore. Markers find new homes in backpacks. Pencils that have no erasers have lost their appeal. Dry erase markers are dried up because they have been used to solve, spell, create. And then what happens?Supplies that were an extra $10 from you at the beginning of the year for one kid become extras in your kid\u2019s teacher\u2019s cart at Target during a grocery run. And forget the $10. Oh no. Multiply that sucker by \u2013 how many kids were in that classroom? Was it 20? 30? Let\u2019s see.Does your job ask you to shell out a couple hundred bucks to upgrade your software or buy staples? And if it\u2019s teaching your kid how to multiply better or be able to compose a sentence without referring to spell check, isn\u2019t that extra $10 a little worth it?I\u2019m frustrated by our entitlement. We act like we\u2019re doing the schools and the teachers a favor when we fill that backpack with tissues and markers.Umm, let\u2019s back up a minute. Aren\u2019t they the ones doing us the favor?I mean, are we willing to take a step (or 200) backward and fill in gaps caused by something as silly as a distracted kid (who then distracts others) because he can\u2019t find a glue stick to finish his project? And yes, we went through school without some of these things, but these kids are more accustomed to bright and shiny. Maybe sad, but still true. And if bright and shiny go away, attention spans shorten, and kids are more disruptive. And guess what? Kids don\u2019t learn as well then.I\u2019m frustrated that we can\u2019t see just how big a job these incredibly underpaid teachers are undertaking. So, my suggestion is to watch for sales and stock up. Buy the extra box of tissues. Do the right thing and thank that teacher for all the efforts to make our future decision-makers great ones.

You Won't Believe What Killed Them", "context": "As of January 29th, just on the shores around the North Sea, sperm whales were found stranded in the shallow area that is not meant for marine wildlife.However, the details of the animals' necropsy that was released shows a very gruesome truth as to how the whales dyed to begin with. Scientists were very concerned and deeply disturbed as to what they found inside the unfortunate whales.Wadden Sea National Park located in Schleswig-Holstein, shows that many of the stranded whales stomachs were actually filled to the brim with plastic debris, which includes a 70 cm piece of plastic known to be apart of a car, a 13-meter-long fishing net, and a variety of other plastic debris that was found as well. Clearly, with this much debris in a whales stomach, there is no possible way for them to digest and get the nutrition necessary in order to survive. Having a full stomach and dying of starvation is one of the cruelest ways any marine animal could perish. The press release that was given fromlocated in Schleswig-Holstein, shows that many of the stranded whales stomachs were actually filled to the brim with plastic debris, which includes a 70 cm piece of plastic known to be apart of a car, a 13-meter-long fishing net, and a variety of other plastic debris that was found as well. Clearly, with this much debris in a, there is no possible way for them to digest and get the nutrition necessary in order to survive. Having a full stomach and dying of starvation is one of the cruelest ways any marine animal could perish.Some people suggest that this is due to the whales thinking that the plastic items were food, like squid since that is a whales go to staple. People on the other hand, however, believe that this is what happens when humanity continues to disregard marine life as well as the overabundance of plastic that is now circulating all over our oceans.Environment minister for the state of Schleswig-Holstein, Robert Habeck states:\"These findings show us the results of our plastic-oriented society. Animals inadvertently consume plastic and plastic waste, which causes them to suffer, and at worst, causes them to starve with full stomachs.\"I n addition to this statement, Nicola Hodgkins who is affiliated with Whale and Dolphin Conservation states:\"Although the large pieces will cause obvious problems and block the gut, we shouldn't dismiss the smaller bits that could cause a more chronic problem for all species of cetacean \u2013 not just those who suction feed.\"It is very important thing to note that the young whales did not die due to the plastic in their stomachs. In fact, according to National Geographic, the whales had died due to heart failure. This was a consequence of them mistakenly swimming into the North Sea, most likely in search of squid, but then not being able to support the weight of their own body's in such shallow water. As an unfortunate result, the whales internal organs had collapsed.Even that being the truth, humanity still needs to address this situation as a major warning sign about how much pollution we are pouring into our oceans. Do not dismiss their deaths as if it were meant to be, because it certainly wasn't.

Some people go so far as to turn on the sink and let the water run, so it only sounds like they're washing their hands.When researchers hid in a public restroom in a Michigan college town, they reported that 10 percent of people didn't wash their hands after using the bathroom, and nearly one in four just rinsed with water. The average handwashing time? Six seconds, far short of the CDC's recommendation for a 20-second scrub. Men were more than twice as likely as women to leave without washing up.\"Men are less concerned about things,\" study author Carl P. Borchgrevink, an associate professor at Michigan State University, tells The Huffington Post. \"They're not as thoughtful and they don't like to be told what to do.\" Men also seemed to think they were clean if they were dealing only with their genitalia. \"Many men suggested that unless they had a bowel movement, there would be no need for washing their hands,\" Borchgrevink says.Michael Sykes, founder of the humor site the International Center for Bathroom Etiquette, says that the act of peeing is so easy for men that it may not register as a way of spreading germs.\"Men don't have to do much more than unzip their pants to take a pee, and they might simply feel like going to the bathroom is so insignificant as to not even merit a hand washing,\" he writes to HuffPost in an email.Seventy percent of people confessed to sometimes rinsing without soap, and 81 percent said they had witnessed a \"non-washing event\" in a public restroom within the past year, according to a 2013 survey by Bradley Corporation, which happens to be a manufacturer of bathroom products.

I tried to bind my chest with an Ace bandage every day. I wore some masculine clothes and told my friends to call me Emmett.\"Neither category applied. \"It felt not only like I was invisible but, especially at that time when hormones are aflutter, like no one would really know what I was like for the rest of my life.\"Gieselman began spending time at Outright Vermont, a trans and queer youth center where the gender lexicon of activists and academe is widely accepted. \"As soon as I learned about a genderqueer identity, I was like, \u2018Oh! That\u2019s the one!\u2019\" said Gieselman, who frequently ends sentences with a gentle laugh. \"Before, it had been really difficult to explain how I was feeling to other people, and even really difficult to explain it in my own head. Suddenly, there was a language for it, and that started the journey.\"Gieselman dumped the girlie name bestowed at birth, asked friends and teachers to use Rocko, the tough-sounding nickname friends had come up with, and told people to use \"they\" instead of \"he\" or \"she.\" \"They\" has become an increasingly popular substitute for \"he\" or \"she\" in the transgender community, and the University of Vermont, a public institution of some 12,700 students, has agreed to use it.While colleges across the country have been grappling with concerns related to students transitioning from one gender to another, Vermont is at the forefront in recognizing the next step in identity politics: the validation of a third gender.The university allows students like Gieselman to select their own identity \u2014 a new first name, regardless of whether they\u2019ve legally changed it, as well as a chosen pronoun \u2014 and records these details in the campuswide information system so that professors have the correct terminology at their fingertips.For years, writers and academics have argued that gender identity is not a male/female binary but a continuum along which any individual may fall, depending on a variety of factors, including anatomy, chromosomes, hormones and feelings. But the dichotomy is so deeply embedded in our culture that even the most radical activists had been focused mainly on expanding the definitions of the two pre-existing categories.Today, a growing number of students are embracing the idea that when it comes to classifying gender, there should be more than two options \u2014 something now afforded by the dating website OkCupid and by Facebook, which last year added a tab for \"custom\" alongside \"male\" and \"female,\" with some 50 options, including \"agender,\" \"androgyne,\" \"pangender\" and \"trans person,\" as well as an option for controlling who can see the customized version.Activists on campuses as diverse as Penn State, University at Albany, University of Chicago, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, and University of California, Riverside, are laying claim to a degree of identity freedom nearly unimaginable when the first L.G.B.T student centers were established. Today\u2019s students, who grew up with Gay-Straight Alliances in their high schools, with transgender people represented in the media and with transgender rights percolating through the courts, arrived on campuses already L.G.B.T.-friendly and, in many cases, equipped with gender-neutral housing and bathrooms.In hopes of raising consciousness of the biases built into social structures and into the language we use to discuss them, students are organizing identity conferences and inventing new vocabularies, which include pronouns like \"ze\" and \"xe,\" and pressing administrations to make changes that validate, in language, the existence of a gender outside the binary.Certainly, there\u2019s a long line of people throughout history whose traits have put them outside norms, and some cultures long ago formalized the existence of a gender that isn\u2019t purely female or purely male, like the American Indian\u2019s two-spirits or India\u2019s hijras. But the binary is a belief system at least as old as Adam and Eve, and most people don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s there. \"It\u2019s like a constant coming-out process, educating those around you that there is a gender binary, and this is what it means to identify outside of it,\" said Gieselman, who works on campus planning gender-related events.Identifying as genderqueer is an opportunity to self-invent, unburdened from social expectations about dress and behavior. Occasionally Gieselman wishes for a lower voice and flatter chest, but other times feels O.K. with, even happy about, having a feminine physique.\"Even within the same day or the next day I can suddenly really love how my chest looks in a sundress,\" said Gieselman, who wears two small nose rings. In the bedroom closet hang T-shirts, flannels, dresses and a rack of bow ties.It might seem a simple turn of events, but adding gender-neutral options to the University of Vermont\u2019s information system took nearly a decade of lobbying, the creation of a task force of students, faculty members and administrators, and six months and $80,000 in staff time to create a software patch.One key to the developments is Dorothea Brauer, a plain-spoken, big-hearted mental health counselor known to everyone as Dot. Ms. Brauer spent nine years working at the campus counseling center before becoming, in 2001, the director of what was then called the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning & Ally Center.While in her 20s and living in New Jersey, Ms. Brauer, who wears her hair cut short with a single, long braid down her back in tribute to a Cherokee grandmother, was spending time with a woman when an acquaintance changed the course of her life by inquiring about the relationship, and then pointedly but nonjudgmentally asking, \"Honey, are you gay?\"\"I said, \u2018Well, yeah, but only with Anita,\u2019 \" recalled Ms. Brauer. (Anita would turn out to be her life partner \u2014 32 years and counting.) \"That\u2019s how clueless I was,\" she said, chuckling over a taco salad lunch at the Penny Cluse Cafe\u0301 in downtown Burlington. \"I was 24, 25, and scared to death. I came out to my mother, only my mother, because I became physically ill with depression.\"A decade later, as one of the few out women on campus in the 1990s, she treated students with debilitating identity issues, some of whom attempted suicide or faced a psychotic break. (L.G.B.T.Q. youth are more than twice as likely to attempt suicide as their heterosexual peers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) Ms. Brauer\u2019s first act upon being installed as the center\u2019s director was to assign a graduate student to research and catalog the unmet needs of the transgender community.Among the difficulties faced by transgender students: inability to use bathrooms marked \"men\" or \"women\" for fear of a confrontation with a confused classmate; being accused of using a stolen student ID in the cafeteria because the name printed on it didn\u2019t match someone\u2019s gender appearance; and having the faculty rely on a student-information system that listed only legal names, leading to occasions when a student might be embarrassed or inadvertently outed. Ms. Brauer heard about one distraught transgender freshman whose professor, while calling roll, first read the student\u2019s feminine legal name, then announced the male nickname.Ms. Brauer reached out to the registrar, Keith P. Williams, who worked with the university\u2019s lawyers to allow transgender students to change their first name in the schoolwide system, but doing so required an in-person visit to the dean of students\u2019 office and filling out paperwork. She then set to work waging a campaign to educate, face to face, members of the faculty, staff and administration on why language sensitivity was so important to a student\u2019s self-respect \u2014 and assisted students in getting school policy amended to specifically prohibit discrimination based on gender identity.By 2009, faculty members themselves began pushing for a broader solution to the identification issue, and Mr. Williams created a task force to look into how students could register a preferred first name without having to make a special request. The task force realized that the only way to guarantee a professor would properly refer to a student was to supply the student\u2019s pronoun on class rosters and advisee lists. Then came the question of which gender-neutral pronoun to offer.\"Students proposed \u2018they/them\u2019 pronouns, but the faculty vetoed the idea because they said it is grammatically incorrect,\" Mr. Williams recalled. \"They said, \u2018You don\u2019t put a plural pronoun with a single individual.\u2019\" A second option, also being used in various trans communities, was \"ze\" (pronounced ZEE), a riff on the German pronoun \"sie,\" with \"hir\" replacing \"his/her.\"Bowing to the faculty, the task force selected \"ze\" and revised its information system, becoming the first school in the nation at which students could select their pronoun. They could also leave the field blank, or opt for \"name only,\" indicating a preference for being referred to by name instead of by pronoun.The change fueled gender-awareness campaigns by students all over the country. So many administrators were receiving requests that, in 2012, the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers convened a task force to draft a list of best practices for handling transgender student records.So far, about 100 schools now allow students, and sometimes employees, to indicate a moniker other than their legal first name, according to the Consortium of Higher Education L.G.B.T Resource Professionals, and hundreds more have contacted Vermont on how to implement the pronoun choice.In September, the university\u2019s pronoun options were expanded yet again to include \"they,\" as grammarians have reminded naysayers that the English language is constantly evolving. Since 2009, 1,891 University of Vermont students have specified a preferred pronoun, with 14 opting for \"ze,\" 10 for \"they\" and another 228 for name only.On campuses across the country gender-conscious students have adopted the earnest, P.C. practice of starting social interactions by introducing themselves by name and \"P.G.P.,\" or preferred gender pronoun. (The most semantically obsessed still object to the word \"preferred.\")Robyn Ochs, an educator who helped found an early L.G.B.T. faculty and staff group at Harvard, believes that Vermont\u2019s changes are nothing less than lifesaving.\"Some people try to reduce this whole topic to kids trying to be cool or they\u2019re just acting out or whatever, just trying to be different or new,\" said Ms. Ochs, who has visited some 500 campuses to speak on L.G.B.T. issues, and often facilitates a discussion she calls \"Beyond Binaries.\" \"But there have always been people who have felt profoundly uncomfortable in their assigned gender roles,\" she said. \"Anything we can do to make them safer, or make them feel recognized, heard, seen, understood, we should do. To validate their identity and experience could, in fact, save their life.\"How does one explain to family members what it means to be neither male nor female? Once, at age 15, in conversation with an aunt at the kitchen table, Gieselman tried unsuccessfully to diagram the concepts of gender and sex on a napkin, with gender referring to the attitudes and behaviors a society associates with a person\u2019s biological sex, and sex referring to a person\u2019s biological status (not to be confused with sexual orientation, one\u2019s romantic interests). \"I don\u2019t even know what it was I was trying to show,\" Gieselman, an eighth-generation Vermonter, recounted with a laugh. Gieselman\u2019s grandmother, too, had a few questions about the napkin. \"They were very confused,\" Gieselman said, \"and still are.\"Sara Miller, Gieselman\u2019s mother, said that when her teenager first came out to her and offered to provide a pronoun chart for reference, she scoffed.\"At the time, it irritated me to no end,\" said Ms. Miller, a social worker. \"I was like, \u2018Really? This is what our struggle is going to be about? Pronouns?\u2019\"But Ms. Miller has learned to accept the person her former little girl has become. \"It\u2019s grown out of the process of really seeing how Rocko has grown as an individual and an adult, seeing how Rocko is their own person, and not a child,\" Ms. Miller said. \"This is how they presents themself to new friends and colleagues and employers and students. That group knows Rocko only that way.\"Although Ms. Miller tries her best to always use \"they/them\" pronouns, she often slips up, but Gieselman isn\u2019t bothered. \"Rocko and I have an understanding. She knows I try,\" said Ms. Miller, slipping up again.At last summer\u2019s orientation for new faculty members, Ms. Brauer handed out pocket-size pronoun charts created by the L.G.B.T. Resource Center at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.

It sits in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, orbiting the sun at a distance almost 46 times farther away than Earth and completing an orbit once every 310 Earth-years. Recent observation by the Hubble Space Telescope, however, has revealed that Makemake is not as lonely as it once appeared: it has a moon.Finding a Dark MoonUntil this new discovery, scientists believed Makemake was the only one of the four officially recognized dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt (Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris) without a moon - the fifth official dwarf planet, Ceres, is closer to Earth and also moonless. However, there were some inconsistencies in prior measurements of Makemake\u2019s light and heat. Observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes revealed warm, dark areas on Makemake\u2019s otherwise bright, cold surface. However, Makemake\u2019s apparently mottled surface would not make sense with a normally rotating dwarf planet unless it was spinning with one of its poles facing directly toward Earth, a fairly unlikely situation. The \"dark moon hypothesis\" offered a simpler explanation: a charcoal-black moon orbiting Makemake. \"Imagine that the dark material isn\u2019t on Makemake\u2019s surface... it\u2019s in orbit!\" image analysis lead and paper coauthor Alex Parker tweeted. \"If the moon is very dark, it accounts for most previous thermal measurements!\"Makemake is the second-farthest away of the official dwarf planets (Eris is the farthest) and the second-brightest (after Pluto). While it may seem strange that astronomers had been able to see moons around farther and dimmer planets while missing Makemake\u2019s moon, the reality is that this moon, informally called MK2, was very good at remaining hidden.MK2 is over 1300 times dimmer and much smaller than Makemake, and its orbit appears to be edge-on to Earth, so we don\u2019t see it circling Makemake, only oscillating back and forth. Looking for it is like looking for a firefly flitting back and forth across a spotlight. If you watch it long enough and are lucky enough to look at the right time, as this team of astronomers did, the firefly might look obvious (in Parker\u2019s words, \"not actually that faint\"), but it was easy to miss before.Part of a team from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, Parker was the first to notice Makemake\u2019s moon in data from the Hubble Space Telescope. At first, hethought someone else must have already seen it. Just to be sure, he asked collaborator and team leader Marc Buie, \"Has anyone seen the moon in the Makemake data?\" When Buie replied, \"There\u2019s a moon in the Makemake data?\" they knew they\u2019d made a major discovery.The Moon in the DataIt is unclear where exactly the moon came from or why its surface is black. More observations of MK2 from Hubble will help astronomers determine whether its orbit is circular or elliptical, which will provide clues to its origin. If MK2\u2019s orbit is elongated, it was probably simply captured in Makemake\u2019s gravity as it floated by. Many smaller Kuiper Belt Objects have dark surfaces like MK2. This is often because they are too small and their gravity too weak to keep bright ices (like the ones that cover Makemake) in place.However, MK2\u2019s darkness could be due to constant interactions with the escaping atmospheric gases streaming off Makemake: like the top of a hearth blackened with ash, it could have accumulated compounds from Makemake\u2019s past atmosphere. If MK2\u2019s orbit is circular, as preliminary estimates indicate, the moon may be merely debris from a collision between Makemake and another Kuiper Belt Object. If MK2 was created by an enormous crash between two Kuiper Belt Objects, according to the paper, \"The apparent ubiquity of trans-Neptunian dwarf planet satellites further supports the idea that giant collisions are a near-universal fixture in the histories of these distant worlds.\" If all of the dwarf planets have satellites (moons), that may mean that Kuiper Belt Objects are often subjected to huge impacts.The New, Improved Makemake SystemWhile MK2 does create questions about the Makemake system and the Kuiper Belt, it will also provide answers. According to Parker, \"The discovery of this moon has given us anopportunity to study Makemake in far greater detail than we ever would have been able to without the companion.\" Makemake is sometimes referred to as \"Pluto\u2019s little sister\" because of their similarities: both are dwarf planets, both have surfaces coated in methane ice, and both have temperatures that can drop to -400 degrees Fahrenheit. The discovery that Makemake has a moon adds yet another similarity to Pluto. When Pluto\u2019s largest moon, Charon, was discovered in 1978, it led to enormous new insights about Pluto itself, including that it was hundreds of times lighter than was originally estimated. \"That's the kind of transformative measurement that having a satellite can enable,\" Parker said: MK2 will almost definitely lead to a fundamental change in how we view the dwarf planet Makemake.Looking at how MK2 orbits Makemake will allow scientists to calculate the system\u2019s mass and probe its inner composition. As Caltech\u2019s Mike Brown, a member of the team that discovered Makemake in 2005, said, \"The wide range of densities of the dwarf planets is one of the most interesting mysteries out there. But we still have so few objects that each one adds a critical part of the story.\" Small worlds like Makemake display a variety of internal compositions: they can contain rock and water ice, as well as other, more \"exotic\" ices and compounds. Since MK2 will allow scientists to tell Makemake\u2019s density and thus the densities of the materials it\u2019s made of, it provides a new clue about the family of dwarf planets.The James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2018, will be able to conclusively test the dark moon hypothesis. Even before then, though, information about Makemake and its moon will continue to accumulate from new Hubble observations, teaching us about the outskirts of our solar system. \"This new discovery opens a new chapter in comparative planetology in the outer solar system,\" Buie said, and it will add to our understanding of the many worlds around us.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1158], "text": ["a charcoal-black moon"]}, "id": "1100188040002123_1107266289294298"}, {"question": "PGA Just Cancelled A Huge Tournament At Trump\u2019s Resort.

The Professional Golf Association (PGA) has decided to not hold their PGA Tour event at Miami\u2019s Trump Doral resort. Instead, they will be moving the prized golf tournament \u2013 which has been held in Miami since 1962- away to Mexico City. It only took the New York real estate mogul and scam university pitchman four short years to destroy the relationship and lose the deal.The orange-faced one is surely red in the face with embarrassment and rage as Mexicans publicly make a loser out of the profane bigot who dreams of building border walls at Mexico\u2019s expense. There is little doubt that the racist Republican\u2019s presidential campaign has cost the vulgarian\u2019s company the prestigious PGA Cadillac Championship tournament at Trump Doral Resort, home to the famed Blue Monster.Mexican conglomerate Grupo Salinas has picked up sponsorship when no American corporation would, and the television production and financial service behemoth got the golf tournament location they wanted in return: Mexico City. As the Miami Herald reports, it\u2019s highly unusual to be unable to replace a sponsor in America\u2019s televised professional sports leagues:Losing a title sponsor, whether of a sporting venue or event these days, defines common. Being unable to replace one, especially for a popular golf tournament with international reach and a half-century of history, defines uncommon. Even in the economically stretched times of 2009-10, the PGA signed lucrative sponsor agreements. Now, the tournament seems headed on the other side of a border on which Trump declares he wants to build a wall.The PGA needs a clean break from the sport\u2019s less than glorious past track record for racial relations after an era when Afro-American-Asian legend Tiger Woods was by far the top draw for the sport. Golf\u2019s professional bodies have worked long and hard to integrate their sport into America\u2019s mainstream majority of tolerant society, the sport having started at member\u2019s only golf clubs which used to exclude women, African-Americans, Latinos and Jews from many private courses.

Trump\u2019s open bigotry caused Cadillac to pull out as the title sponsor, and nobody else in corporate America wanted to touch Trump\u2019s signature golf course with a ten foot pole.Trump handled the news poorly, blurting this out on a Fox News appearance: \"They\u2019re moving it to Mexico City which, by the way, I hope they have kidnapping insurance.

They even find inspiration from past trends, making everything old, new again. TV shows like Mad Men brought back the Don Draper cut, with tightened sides and a sharp part on the left side of the head that was typical among business professionals in the late 60s.With a population of roughly 318 million people here in the U.S., there is a huge range of styles and opinions when it comes to haircuts. But which is the cut that gets requested the most? GQ recently asked 500 barbers and stylists across our nation for the top three most requested haircuts. Their expectations about haircut preferences varying by region were...cut short. Before revealing the most requested haircut, here's a look at what's not on the top of everyone's list. Perhaps the mullet dominates in Kentucky or Oklahoma. Popularized by musicians like Rod Stewart and David Bowie (RIP), the mullet was predominant as far back as the early 70s. Some guys prefer to stay stuck in the era of disco. Still, it is not a popular haircut. No judgment here. You do your 'do the way you do!Perhaps the buzzcut is favored more in Iowa.Sadly, the buzzcut lacks the length of hair enough to be sweeping the nation. Maybe the Southwest prefers the Caesar's cut.None of these styles were in hot demand. But when all the data was compiled, there was one haircut that was consistently favored among men from Schenectady to Cincinnati, Portland to Nashville, Juneau to NYC, and every city in between. So which cut made the cut? There's no official name for the style, but it's basically the 'undercut,' long on top and short on the sides. The clean-cut style of a longer crown with a clipper cut fade on the sides won out as the preferred cut of choice. The prime example of the desired haircut is sported here by one of the most desirable men in Hollywood: Ryan Reynolds.The style is easily adaptable for both casual and formal occasions. This haircut works with most types of hair, including thick, wavy and curly hair. Want the same haircut? GQ shares how to ask your barber for the popular cut:The popular style is also easy to maintain, and there are plenty of options to play with.The word is out. This is the nation's popular haircut for now. But how long can it last? Will barbers be forever shearing this time-transcending method of the undercut, or will the style last as briefly as a cheap bottle of Dep gel?

Ask any true Roman about it and you'll be met with a befuddled \"who is-a Alfredo?\" That's because, fellow Americans, Roman children didn't grow up scarfing down plates of this creamy comfort food like we did here. (Then again, Olive Garden has yet to hit Mediterranean shores.) Alfredo, after all, isn't found alongside carbonara and amatriciana in the pantheon of celebrated local dishes\u2014not because it isn't Roman, but because it never spread throughout the city. Its origins lay in a single, no-name trattoria on a side street near the Trevi Fountain. In the early 1900s, the eponymous Alfredo di Lielo needed a calorific meal to feed his pregnant wife. So he combined butter and cheese and melted it over fettuccine noodles. Sated, his wife insisted he add it to his menu.But it remained a strictly of-the-house specialty. Despite the acclaim (rumors swirl that Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks ate it on their Roman holiday in 1927), other trattorias likely rejected it due to inauthenticity. Alfredo used parmigiano for the cheese (a bold move in Pecorino Romano country) and butter, which was pretty much as foreign an ingredient to Italians at the time as milk was to the Japanese. But it did take off stateside thanks to a Pennsylvania noodle company: Pennsylvania Dutch marketed a creamy sauce called Alfredo after influential New York restaurateur George Renart raved about the dish in the Saturday Evening Post when he returned from a trip to Rome. The version we eat now\u2014loaded with cream, often with chicken\u2014is a bastardization of what Alfredo cooked up a century ago. And it's definitely not what you would find in Rome now, even if those trattorias from Testaccio to Prati had Alfredo on the menu (which they don't).Should we just quit the search and make do with carbonara instead? Local food expert Elizabeth Minchilli says no way. \"I always encourage travelers to seek out Alfredo in Rome,\" she says. \"You just need to know where to go.\" That would be Trattoria della Scrofa, between Piazza Navona and the Trevi Fountain, a 103-year-old restaurant that Alfredo started after his first spot was flattened to make space for a shopping center. What you\u2019ll get is a heaping plate of pasta prepped as Alfredo did it all those years ago: hot noodles, on a hot plate, mixed with (lots of) softened butter and (lots of) grated parmigiano right at your table. What you won\u2019t get is cream, garlic, or an overwhelming crush of travelers.

Today, few theaters still have marquees that you can see without standing in front of the ticket window, and the amount of space given to each title is such that even titles much shorter than Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption end up getting cut off.While we\u2019ll never know if the title change would have meant earlier financial success for Shawshank Redemption, making it one of the most popular films ever made.Throughout his career, Morgan Freeman has been in a ton of incredible movies like Shawshank. In fact, his mere presence is enough to get most people excited about a movie, but did you know he was actually in one of the biggest flops of 2015? In fact, the movie made so little that almost no one even knows the film exists. Click over to the next page for the full story. As of this writing, The Shawshank Redemption is sitting atop the IMDB rankings of the most popular movies of all-time. The film is truly beloved today. However, that wasn\u2019t always the case. While the film was critically praised upon its release, it was a commercial failure. Nobody saw it in the theaters, and most fans found it on home video or cable later. Morgan Freeman thinks that a large part of the reason the movie did so badly at first is because the title is awful.Appearing on Late Night With Seth Meyers , Morgan Freeman says he knew thatwas a great film as soon as he read the script, and that he was willing to play any role just to be in it, but if there was one thing he could have changed about it, it was the title page.While the original title of Stephen King\u2019s novelladoesn\u2019t do any better job telling you anything about what the movie actually is, Morgan Freeman has a point that at least that version has the name of a famous movie actress included, which is something people will recognize. Shawshank, the name of the prison where the film takes place, is a meaningless word by itself. Morgan Freeman jokes in the interview that many people would mispronounce the word, even while telling him how much they loved the movie.Hearing that the reason the title was shortened was so that it could fit on theater marquees is almost quaint. Today, few theaters still have marquees that you can see without standing in front of the ticket window, and the amount of space given to each title is such that even titles much shorter thanend up getting cut off. Morgan Freeman makes a good point, that by doing the title his way, the part that you see has Rita Hayworth\u2019s name, which is something, although it\u2019s possible the studio was afraid people would think the theater was showing old movies.While we\u2019ll never know if the title change would have meant earlier financial success for The Shawshank Redemption we do know that the title they chose didn\u2019t help.

And the results will surprise you.It's logical to think that states with notoriously bad traffic would produce some of the nation's rudest commuters, and while states like New York, New Jersey and the District of Columbia fall in the top 10, the state with the absolute rudest drivers is tucked away in the Rocky Mountains: Idaho.(MORE: 10 Cities With the Worst Drivers)The survey concluded that Idaho is made up of two main types of drivers -- \"those who are moving so slowly that they're judged to be rude, and the aggressive drivers who speed around them and flip them off.\" The imperfect marriage of these two driving types propels the Gem State to the top of the list.One responder took a stab at explaining the strange dichotomy happening in the Northwest.

What Science Is Saying About Fiction Readers", "context": "Will S.For most, the love of books starts in childhood. For others, this love blooms later, eventually revealing the vibrant colors of a true bibliophile! But science has started looking into the effects of reading on the brain. They\u2019ve done experiments, ran MRIs, polled, and surveyed, all to what end? Studies have been released in the past several years that have given scientists some interesting data about fiction readers and what type of fiction they should read!What has science concluded? Studies are showing that readers of fiction are more empathetic towards others. By engaging with a story, readers are temporarily placing themselves in a character\u2019s shoes, therefore, the more stories you read, the more shoes you\u2019ve tried on. It\u2019s a fascinating insight into the world of reading.In 2012, Standford University did research into why this is. According to neuroscientist Bob Dougherty,\"The right patterns of ink on a page can create vivid mental imagery and instill powerful emotions.\"Your brain does amazing things while you\u2019re reading, the breadth of which researchers are still defining. And by placing yourself into the world of a great novel, you are given the chance to experience something new that could be informative in your interactions with other people.This compassion was notably detected in children reading Harry Potter. Another experiment \"conducted three studies to test whether extended contact through reading the popular best-selling books of Harry Potter improves attitudes toward stigmatized groups (immigrants, homosexuals, refugees).\"The conclusion of the study was that children who identified with Harry as a character reacted to his sympathy for marginalized groups (such as \"mudbloods\") by becoming more sympathetic towards similar groups in contemporary society (such as the LGBT and immigrant communities). But this was only shown after these connections were explicated to the children and only if they identified with Harry.What does this all mean?Sure, we create images in our heads of the stories we read \u2013we engage with language, we sympathize with the characters in our books\u2013 but besides Harry Potter, which books should we be reading to maximize these cognitive benefits?The authors of another study, David Comer Kidd and Emanuele Castano, tackled this question, but also asserted that what you choose read is important! As Castano explained to Mic.com:\"We believe that one critical difference between lit and pop fiction is the extent to which the characters are complex, ambiguous, difficult to get to know, etc. (in other words, human) versus stereotyped, simple...\"Through their research, they found that readers of literary fiction receive more of the empathetic benefits of reading than those who read pop-fiction or non-fiction. The term \"literary fiction\" seems arbitrary, but Kidd and Castano explain that literary fiction merely denotes the level of complexity in stories and their characters (at least, that\u2019s what it means in the context of their study).In 50 Shades Of Grey, for example, the characters are laid out. They react to each other and to their environment. By no means are these characters simple or easy, but they do not evoke the same complicated and uncanny feelings that one experiences with Nick Carraway as he narrates The Great Gatsby.Reading in general helps with empathy, but literary reading amplifies this effect. By reading a challenging book, you\u2019re not only becoming a smarter person, you\u2019re also become more empathetic. Literature is not always easy, but by attempting to tackle harder books, we create new connections in our minds that we might not have otherwise.Like opening a window to let fresh air into your home, literature opens up our minds to the myriad ideas that we wouldn\u2019t be able to experience on our own!

Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard/Bloomberg\"There\u2019s a large Middle Eastern population in Detroit, and I\u2019ve been really influenced by the brightness of Middle Eastern flavors,\" Ludwinski said over the phone. \"Also I have a total obsessive love for tahini.\"One of Michigan native Ludwinski\u2019s earliest memories is of her parents taking her to a Cinnabon and seeing the magic behind the scenes. \"I will always remember watching people put the cinnamon into the dough, the slicing and the icing,\" Ludwinski says. It\u2019s no coincidence that at Sister Pie she designed an open kitchen, too. Anyone walking in for a cup of coffee and some shortbread can see bakers scooping cookies, sealing hand pies with a fork, or rolling out dough by hand.Sister Pie's counter is filled with other goodies, such as these freshly baked peanut butter cookies (spiked with paprika). Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard/BloombergLudwinski moved to New York in 2006 to pursue a career in theater, but she was sidetracked by the food scene. At Momofuku's Milk Bar, where she worked for Christina Tosi, she developed a taste for low-moisture, high-fat Plugra butter, which Ludwinski now uses for all her doughs. \"You\u2019ve got to use it every time,\" she says, \"because the flavor is so different, and so clear.\" She picked up the habit of adding a splash of apple cider vinegar to the dough at Four & Twenty Blackbirds pie shop in Gowanus, Brooklyn, where Ludwinski spent a year making pies. Ludwinski says this gives the crust a bit of extra flake and a mild tang.This Thanksgiving will mark the shop\u2019s first holiday since its opening back in April in Detroit's West Village, and Ludwinski is planning to stay open until noon to sell locals fresh pies like sweet potato-marshmallow, brandy-pecan, and salted maple pumpkin. \"It just seems kind of silly for a pie shop to be closed on Thanksgiving,\" she says.Lisa Ludwinski of Sister Pie in Detroit.

Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard/BloombergMethod:1. Prepare the pie dough: I\u200bn a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour until it\u2019s in coarse pieces about the size of peas. Add the ice water a tablespoon at a time and begin to gather the dough together with your hands. Pat the dough into a 1-inch-thick square and wrap in plastic to chill for a couple of hours in the fridge (or at least 30 minutes).2. Roast the squash: While the crust is chilling, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Using a sharp knife, halve the squash and hollow out the seedy center with a spoon. Place squash cut sides up on a baking sheet and brush with butter. Bake for about one hour, or until the flesh is soft and cooked through. Once it's cooled, scoop out the flesh and add to a food processor with the pumpkin pure\u0301e and mix until smooth. (If the squash is very wet, place in a cheesecloth and press to get rid of any excess moisture.) Set aside.3. Make the cardamom cream: I\u200bn a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring cream and cardamom to a gentle simmer. Turn off heat, cover, and steep for 20 minutes. Strain and set aside to cool.4. Mix the filling: I\u200bn a medium bowl, w\u200bhisk together light brown sugar, spices, cornmeal, and salt. In another bowl, mix eggs with cardamom cream, squash, and vanilla and whisk until smooth. Slowly pour egg mixture into sugar mixture and whisk until combined.5. Prepare the pie crust: Flour your work surface and place the unwrapped dough in the center. Roll out, keeping it moving with your hands and throwing on more flour as needed to prevent sticking, until you have a disk of even thickness that\u2019s about 12 inches in diameter. Invert your pie tin or dish onto the circle, and cut a circle that is about 1 to 2 \u00adinches larger than the tin. Place the folded dough into the pie tin and gently press it in. Roll up the extra dough hanging over the edge toward the center of the pie, creating a ring of dough, then crimp it all around. Put the crust in the freezer for at least 15 minutes.6. Blind bake the pie crust so that it holds its shape and is cooked through in the finished pie: P\u200breheat the oven to 425 degrees with a rack on the lowest level. Remove the pie crust from the freezer and place a square of aluminum foil over it. Fill with dried beans and place on baking sheet. Bake in oven for 15 minutes. Cool for 6 minutes, then carefully remove foil and beans. Turn heat down to 325 degrees.Travel with us, drive with us, eat with us. Get our weekly Pursuits newsletter.7. Fill and finish the pie: Brush the crimped edges of pie crust with a little bit of egg wash, then spoon all of the tahini\u00ad-walnut paste onto the bottom of the crust and spread evenly (you can use your fingers to gently press it down). Pour the squash filling over the paste and carefully transfer back to oven. Bake pie for 40 minutes to 1 hour, until the edges are puffed up and the center is only slightly jiggly, then remove from oven and sprinkle lightly with sesame seeds. The pie should rest for at least 2 hours before slicing, and can also chill for a couple of hours in the fridge after it\u2019s cooled if you like to serve it cold.Tejal Rao is the New York food critic for Bloomberg.

The country is Samsung's home turf.(Scurzuzu / Flickr)Apple is massively known as one of the top purveyors of new innovations and advancements in technology. With the new patent filed by Apple recently, no one would not think what the Cupertino-giant is preparing in the pipeline.Apple has filed lately a patent application with code US 20160264304 A1 for a paper bag. According to a report by The Telegraph, the patent is described as \"a bag container formed of white solid bleached sulfate paper with at least 60% post-consumer content.\"The report stressed that this quirky innovation by Apple has already been in use around its stores across the globe and not too many noticed it until the patent came out. Apart from the patent being filed by Apple, the new paper bag innovation caught the attention of the tech community because of its support to environmental preservation.Accordingly, this paper bag is made of 60% recycled materials. As Apple's application stated, \"The bag may be formed entirely of paper with the potential exception of adhesives for fixing together portions of the bag. This can help to reduce any environmental impact from production, use, and disposal of the bag.\"It furthered that the bag container material can be suitably used for many times even after slight tearing. However, like the wireless earbuds Apple produced for the iPhone 7, the paper bag technology has drawn flak and sarcasm from netizens.Meanwhile, the company has slowly been introducing efforts to improve current state of the environment. Earlier this year, Apple made public a robot called Liam to partake in recycling old iPhone units.

Because regardless of your feelings on legalized pot, Colorado will leave you feeling absolutely magical.If you're an urbanite, a mountaineer, a ski bum, a history nerd, an outdoor adventurer... you get the point... there is something for you in Colorado. And if you're not dazzled by the epic natural wonders Colorado has to offer, you might not have a soul.Not convinced? Maybe these 19 reasons will prove that Colorado is the most magical state in America.1. Because with \"300 days of sunshine,\" Colorado is one of the sunniest places in America.And who doesn't love a sunny day? The \"300 days of sunshine\" thing is actually a myth. According to the Colorado Climate Center, there's no technical definition of \"days of sunshine,\" so measuring it gets tricky. They go on, however, to state that Colorado only has 30-40 overcast days per year, leaving at least 300 days of partial sunshine. They estimate only about 115 days that would fit the classic definition of clear... but 300 days of partial sunshine, at the least, still sounds awesome.2. Being at a high altitude just makes things more fun.Colorado has the highest average elevation in the country. The lowest point in Colorado, located at the Arikaree River, is 3,315 feet above sea level. The highest is Mt. Elbert, located at 14,433 feet above sea level. Denver, the state's capital, legitimately earns its nickname of \"Mile High City\" standing at an elevation of 5,280 feet high. At these elevations, the sun is stronger. You also could potentially get drunk faster.3. Colorado is a beer-lover's happy place.Colorado consistently ranks among the best craft brew states in America. The state has more than 200 breweries, including 130 microbreweries, according to USA Today's 2013 count. Denver itself has more than 20 breweries.4. Because, the Rockies.Whether you're into skiing, hiking, climbing, driving or just looking at pretty scenery, the Rocky Mountains are easily one of America's greatest natural wonders. Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the most visited national parks, for good reason. Breathtaking views are guaranteed, whether the mountains are blanketed in snow or lush green trees.5. You can rock out surrounded by rocks at Red Rocks Amphitheater.It's been called one of the best amphitheaters in America. If you can't get concert tickets, visiting by day and hiking a trail or having a picnic is a great way to experience Red Rocks.6. Or spend some heavenly time at Garden of the Gods.As far as U.S. natural wonders go, this is a must see. The National Natural Landmark offers beautiful rock formations and other archeological wonders.7. Or visit the Flatirons, which are some of the coolest looking foothills you'll ever see.The Flatirons are located in Boulder and have a rich climbing history. They're cool to view from afar and the climbs themselves offer terrific views and some challenging routes.8. Winding mountain roads are basically nature's roller coaster.Well, nature provided the mountain. Man built the road. But still, driving up and then down a mountain is an experience every thrill-seeker should experience, and the Rockies are perfect for it. Try Loveland Pass for steep climbs, hairpin turns and views that will make both your stomach and jaw drop.9. Travel back in time and visit gold rush and mining towns.These cool little old-school mining towns look like they're out of a movie (or Snow White, maybe?). Most people associate the gold rush with California, but let's not forget Pike's Peak and Colorado's role in the fun. Follow the Colorado Gold Trail and pass through gold and silver mine towns like Idaho Springs, Breckenridge and Black Hawk. Mine tours are also available in many towns as well.10. Denver's homegrown burger chain, Smashburger, is beyond delicious.While it's up for debate where the original smashburger came from, Smashburger as we know it today is Denver born and bred. Denver is also home to the first ever Chipotle... which is pretty cool, though you can eat Chipotle pretty much anywhere these days.11. Or, if you're feeling really adventurous, you could always try Rocky Mountain Oysters.Warning: Rocky Mountain Oysters are not actually oysters. They are bull testicles and they are a delicacy...we kid you not.11. Coors Field is not just a place to watch baseball.The home of the Colorado Rockies is consistently ranked as one of the top ballparks in the country. And the ballpark's not just for fans -- the over-the-top stadium offers plenty to eat and drink, and sweeping views of Denver and the mountains beyond. Tickets start as low as $4, so it's a great deal.12. Colorado's welcome signs are cooler than yours.13. Denver is mecca for all things delicious, fun and cheap.Beer is cheap, ice cream is in abundance and the cost of living won't leave you totally broke. Denver is also near plenty of outdoor adventure, so urbanites can escape from the city whenever their hearts desire.14. And Boulder is a haven for crunchy types with no shortage of activity, and awesome proximity to nature, of course.15. Because you can walk into a recreational marijuana dispensary and buy marijuana, legally.Both in-state residents and visitors (over 21-years-old) can shop at the dispensaries, though Coloradans can purchase more product than tourists. And these shops don't just sell weed... they sell marijuana-infused edibles, oils, beverages and more. If you fancy yourself a consumer of marijuana, you will be in heaven. Keep in mind, you can only smoke in private, buy from licensed dispensaries and cannot bring marijuana products out of the state.16. Colorado is home to the North American Aerospace Defense Command... And you know what they do, right?They track Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, duh.17. Want some thrills? How about white water rafting? Zip lining? Ice climbing? Hang gliding?The state is an adrenaline junkie's paradise.18. Because Colorado sets records... Zombie Crawl records, that is.19. And, if you haven't figured it out yet, Colorado is paradise for the outdoorsy type.You can't beat these numbers -- Colorado boasts four national parks, 42 state parks, 11 national forests, two national grasslands and eight national wildlife refuges.

Chicago's per-pack cigarette tax will be 31 cents higher than New York City\u2019s $6.86 per pack making them the priciest cigarettes tax-wise in the nation.According to Emanuel's budget, the 50-cent tax increase is expected to bring in $7 million for the city, the Tribune reports.Though the tax increase is relatively hefty, it actually marks a rare concession from Mayor Emanuel. The mayor originally proposed at 75-cent increase to the objection of city councilmen concerned it would be met with increased illegal sales of loose cigarettes in their wards.The $3 million shortfall left by the lower tax increase will be filled by increasing the fine for parking in front a fire hydrant from $100 to $150 and tapping other revenue streams at the city's two airports.Ald.

And only 22 percent of infants are exclusively breastfed to 6 months, which the WHO recommends due to breastmilk\u2019s unparalleled nutritional properties. Those deficiencies are largely due to a lack of institutional support, as less than half of moms receive any paid time off after childbirth, limiting their ability to breastfeed.The report also found that at least 40 percent of parents introduce solid foods and sugary drinks to their children too early, and one in four toddlers don\u2019t receive enough iron in their diet.That doesn\u2019t even begin to address all the economic factors at play.\"Half of the babies born in this country are participating in Women, Infants and Children program here in the United States,\" Lucy Sullivan, the executive director of 1,000 Days, said on Capitol Hill Wednesday, referring to the program commonly known as WIC.\"That\u2019s a reminder that the problems we are dealing with is not a small population over here somewhere in the U.S. that maybe looks like the population of a developing country,\" she added. \"It is all of us. The face of hunger and malnutrition looks like America.\"Hugh Welsh, the president of DSM, a major global producer of vitamins, minerals and nutrition supplements, highlighted the lack of understanding in the U.S. about the dire need for a well-balanced mix of vitamins and nutrients.\"I could travel to Malawi, and everyone there would understand, but I could travel to Milwaukee and no one would understand what I was talking about with micronutrients,\" he said.In the first 1,000 days of a child\u2019s life, the brain needs the proper mix of nutrients to fully form. Without enough iron or specific vitamins, a child\u2019s brain may never form all its potential synapses. They can also be physically weaker, and the combination can set the child up to be less competitive in the workforce later in life and raise their health care costs.Experts also worry that the nutritional diets of infants today mimic those of a growing number of overweight and obese American adults, setting them up for a lifetime unhealthy food choices and health problems.The face of hunger and malnutrition looks like America. Lucy Sullivan, Executive Director of 1,000 DaysBarbara Bush, daughter of former President George W.

The food then mysteriously appears on location in a glass \"cubby\" displaying the customer's name, and they're free to chow down. This means no lines, no counter and no human conversation, because what could be worse? The concept, while intriguing, also sounds a bit terrifying. So with a mind full of skepticism Mashable headed down to the newly opened Midtown Manhattan location to see what all the hype is about.While one might assume a cashier-free environment would be completely devoid of human interaction, that was far from the case. Though I initially feared the establishment would have a lifeless art gallery-esque vibe, the music was pumping, the customers were chatting and upon walking into the sleek restaurant I was instantly greeted by a friendly Eatsa \"mascot.\"Much like Apple Geniuses, Eatsa has several employees stationed on the floor to offer customer assistance and ensure you're not entirely left alone. \"There are always people on the floor \u2014 our mascots, we call them \u2014 and we\u2019re out here helping the guests and getting them through the process,\" explained Scott Bruggman, an Eatsa corporate trainer who began as an R&D chef creating bowls.To the right of the wood-floored room stood a row of electronic ordering kiosks, and to the left, the restaurant had several tables for those who wanted to engage in a slightly more familiar dining experience. This all felt relatively tame, but the back of the restaurant held the real magic: a wall made entirely of electronic, microwave-looking cubbies that would reveal your mysteriously prepared meal. Zap. Since there was no one to take my order, I made my way to the kiosk to choose from the customizable bowls, bites and beverages on Eatsa's strictly vegetarian menu. Once I put in my request for a Hummus & Falafel Bowl, I walked toward the illuminated cubbies and within minutes my name was displayed on the screen above them, alerting me that my order was up. This was the moment of truth.Right before your food arrives in your cubby, Eatsa fills you with intrigue. Your cubby turns completely dark to prevent you from seeing the secrets of the kitchen and tantalizingly displays the words, \"It's coming.\" After you're given a playful peek at your meal, the cubby gives you the literal green light and you can receive your meal by tapping the glass twice.TBH, it felt like something straight out of The Jetsons.The process was quick, simple and the food was fresh, as promised.Though I was satisfied with the space-age experience, I couldn't stop wondering what the hell was going on behind that wall of mystery. I turned to Dean Marsh, director of market operations for the East Coast for some answers, but was kindly shut down. Marsh adamantly explained that much like the secrecy of costumed characters at Disney World, the public is not supposed to know what truly goes on in the depths of the Eatsa kitchen.Very ominous.Despite the attempt to keep the tricks of the trade to themselves, many believe that several human chefs work alongside robots. \"The Eatsa bots are back there,\" Bruggman said. \"There\u2019s a lot of different things going on and we use as much technology as we can to better enhance the experience.\"First-time customers and vegetarians Madee Bryke and her boyfriend Andrew Powell also had their theories. \"There are people back there; I know that,\" Bryke said. \"I think it\u2019s fun that there\u2019s robots, but there are definitely people still working.\"As of right now, Bruggman described the tech and human ratio as \"a real blend \u2014 that\u2019s how we make it so fast and so quick.\"With the rise of technology creating strong barriers against personal interaction, one of the major concerns the innovative restaurant raises is that the lack of human interaction may come across as too impersonal.While this may seen like a dream for introverts, surprisingly, the futuristic vibe only made things more fun. Millennials, such as Sabina M. who works a few blocks away and was eating there for the second day in a row, felt that if anything, the environment was encouraging people to be more social. \"Maybe it\u2019s just because of the novelty,\" she said, \"but it seems like people are almost more social here cause everyone\u2019s like woah this is crazy. So it\u2019s kind of getting people to talk to one another.\" Bryke and Powell, also millennials, agreed. \"I definitely think it almost opens it up to more talk, it seems like they have a community,\" Bryke said.Her boyfriend, Powell, said that when you think about it, the automated restaurant is not much different from other forms of take-out. \"People already order Seamless and then go pick it up from a delivery guy so how is this much different? It\u2019s almost like a robot\u2019s making it anyways.\"To get a sense of how the older demographic was feeling about the revolutionary service, Gen X-er and first-time customer, Maarten Nederlof gave Mashable his two-cents. \"We\u2019re a little older and have been watching the whole decline in social interaction,\" he said. \"So this is a walk on the non-interacting side for us, but I think for younger people who have no social interaction, coming here is a great avoidance scheme.\"Nederlof explained that there are still tables, so people getting food can sit down inside and socialize. Therefore it's the best of both worlds. \"Are you really missing out on that much?\" he questioned. Marsh, director of market operations for Easta, feels the restaurant's technology is actually giving people more time to engage in social interaction. \"Where you may spend 15 to 20 minutes at any of our competitors getting in and out with the regular fast food concept, for us it's three to four minutes. We feel that extra time gives you even more time interact with people,\" he said. Though the Manhattan Eatsa has only been open for a few days, the restaurant's unique style is receiving a lot of love (just like like the five other locations in California and D.C.)\"Every restaurant competitor on the street has been in at least two times and we\u2019ve only been open for two days. We\u2019ve gotten a lot of interest from the big boys: the McDonalds and Starbucks of the world,\" he said.What's next?

In addition to feature films, it also includes comic books, short films, and television series. Films in the MCU have been split into three distinct phases.It was acquired back in 2009 by the Walt Disney Co. DIS for $4 billion. Many were worried that the deal would both ruin beloved Marvel characters like Iron Man and damage Disney's financial standing and stock valuation. Fast forward to 2016, and Disney's acquisition could very well be one of the best things to happen to both the media giant and the comic book publisher.However, it looks like the MCU is quickly coming to an end, at least as we know it. In an interview with IGN , Anthony Russo-who will be directing the upcoming Avengers films with his brother Joe-said that \"these two movies are intended to be the culmination of everything that has happened in the MCU since the very first Iron Man movie...In being a culmination, these movies are in some ways going to be an end to certain things, and in some ways, they're going to be the beginning of certain things.\"With this in mind, how much money has Marvel grossed at the total worldwide box office? And how much more can it bring in? Let's break it down:Phase OneIron Man - $585,174,222The Incredible Hulk - $263,427,551Iron Man 2 , bringing in $623,933,331Thor - $449,326,618Captain America: The First Avenger - $370,569,774The Avengers - $1,518,594,910Phase TwoIron Man 3 - $1,518,594,910Thor: The Dark World - $644,783,140Captain America: The Winter Soldier - $714,121,534Guardians of the Galaxy - $774,176,600Avengers: Age of Ultron - $1,398,858,115Ant-Man - $518,585,201Phase ThreePhase three is just in its beginning stage, but will wrap up by 2019. The first of the last 10 films of the MCU, Captain America: Civil War , brought in almost $1.5 billion worldwide during its theatrical release.Audiences can look forward to Doctor Strange hitting theaters this fall; Guardians of the Galaxy 2 , Spider-Man: Homecoming , and Thor: Ragnarok debuting in 2017; Black Panther , Avengers: Infinity War , and Ant-Man and the Wasp premiering in 2018; and Captain Marvel and the untitled Avengers sequel coming to theaters in 2019.The Marvel EffectAs of now, the MCU has grossed $10,527,843,932 at the box office, and if the next nine films can live up to each of their respective predecessors, the franchise could very well double, and even triple, its worldwide earnings. Both of the next Avengers films could easily make $1 billion each, and if the next Guardians , Thor , and Ant-Man movies follow in common sequel fashion, they could all make well over their originals' total earnings.Predicting gross profit from films is difficult, as Hollywood accounting is notoriously complicated, but it is safe to argue that Marvel has proven to be the ultimate money maker. Its films, comics, TV shows, merchandise, and all other revenue sources show that Disney made the entertainment deal of a lifetime.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Only 3 percent said it's not an issue at all, while 22 percent called it a \"minor problem.\" Yet even among people who weren't enrolled in college, 54 percent still considered student debt a major issue.A plurality -- 39 percent -- blame colleges and universities for the rising amount of student debt, compared with just 10 percent who think students are at fault. Survey respondents were more likely to blame colleges for rising student debt if they were currently enrolled in school.The cost of a college degree has increased 12-fold in the last 30 years, while having such a degree has become even more important to those seeking full-time employment. But policy experts and consumer watchdogs have increasingly flagged the wealth loss and ripple effect that the nation's $1.2 trillion in student debt is having on the economy as a whole.\"Young people who are coming of age today understand that getting a postsecondary education is important [but] they have a lot of fear about the rising cost of higher education,\" said Rory O'Sullivan, Policy and Research Director at Young Invincibles, a group that aims to represent young people in policy debates.Matthew Segal, co-founder and head of millennial advocacy nonprofit OurTime.org, was \"pleasantly surprised\" to see that young adults are putting responsibility for the trend with colleges.\"People are finally realizing that the college arms race must stop if we are ever going to rein in costs,\" Segal said.Segal noted that George Washington University, for instance, is currently building a $130 million \"super dorm\" on campus, and students at the University of Pennsylvania are able to dine at a juice bar after hitting up the golf simulator at one of the campus fitness centers. This phenomena of spending resources on extravagant secondary amenities isn't limited to private schools, either: Iowa State University recently spent $46.2 million renovating one of two campus gyms, resulting in a facility equipped with rock walls and hot tubs, while the University of California-Davis offers swimming pools in some residence halls.\"Too many colleges are acting in the interest of building prestige over providing an affordable pathway to higher learning for their students,\" Segal said.However, 32 percent of respondents in the new survey pointed the finger at the federal government, which handles roughly 85 percent of the nation's outstanding student debt. The U.S. Department of Education collected $42.5 billion from borrowers in fiscal year 2013 alone.Although O'Sullivan believes there's plenty of blame to go around, he was struck by how few placed responsibility on state governments, despite the connection between state legislative appropriations and tuition at public colleges. Only 8 percent of Harvard's survey respondents said state governments were to blame for rising student loan debt.A 2012 New York Federal Reserve study linked mounting tuition costs at public universities, where a majority of students get their degrees, to state budget cuts. A previous Huffington Post/YouGov poll found most Americans believe state universities are no longer affordable.\"We invest less than we used to, per student,\" O'Sullivan noted.Young Invincibles is currently working with student groups on campuses to raise awareness of how the state budget process affects their tuition bill. O'Sullivan believes the trillion-dollar number has captured the attention of many people, but now it's important to explain why student debt is big and \"what it is we need to fix it.\"More than 7 in 10 in the Harvard poll said that their own financial circumstances were an important factor in whether or not they attended college.The Huffington Post collaborated with the Harvard Institute of Politics on questions asked of college-age Americans.

According to a recent study at the University of Chicago, sleep deprivation is also the cause of an increase in the appetite for salty and sweet treats. The results are quite substantial, going into the link between obesity and sleep deprivation.Just by depriving oneself of sleep, one can experience an increase in appetite a lot like the one experienced after getting stoned. The results even suggest that it may be a reaction of the body that causes the hunger boost much like getting the munchies after a joint.Conducting the studyThe University of Chicago invited 14 men and women in their twenties to come and participate in two sessions at the clinical research centre there at the university. The researchers controlled the sleep patterns of the participants, meaning that sometimes they slept 7 hours and at other times their sleep was reduced down to only 4 hours and 11 minutes. The researchers also controlled how much food and what food was being served to the participants, serving them three meals a day at 9 am, 2 pm and 7 pm.After the fourth night of each session, the participants were offered snacks from which to choose. They included the kind of snacks we like to indulge in when we are stoned, such as extremely sweet or salty food. They found that those that were sleep deprived were far less likely to resist the offer of snacks, and their urge to binge on them was highest in the afternoon right through to the early evening.Sleep deprivation and obesityIt has long been believed that there is a link between sleep deprivation and obesity, and this study can confirm the very reason that they may be linked. Depriving the human body of sleep interfere\u2019s with its production of hormones that control things like appetite and satiety.The scientists conducting this study looked into the kind of hormones that were present in the blood during the study. They looked specifically at the hormones ghrelin and leptin. Ghrelin is the hormone that deals with appetite whereas leptin is the hormone that tells the brain when the body is full of food.The endocannabinoid systemFinally, the scientists decided that they would delve a little further into the body\u2019s craving for food and have a look at the endocannabinoid system, the same system that is excited and activated by using marijuana. Erin Hanlon, who lead the study, found that there was a certain endocannabinoid that was increased after sleep deprivation that could be the cause for the increase in appetite.Endocannabinoid 2-AG is the chemical that increases the amount of pleasure you feel after you eat, and is an endocannabinoid that also increases after the use of marijuana. \"We know that marijuana activates the endocannabinoid system and causes people to overeat when they are not hungry, and they normally eat yummy sweet and fatty foods,\" Hanlon said. \"Sleep restriction may cause overeating by acting in the same manner.\"So it seems that sleep deprivation has a very similar effect on the body in terms of appetite as using marijuana does. This means that a future of dealing with obesity through medicine that targets the endocannabinoid system is possible, although much more consideration would be required before moving into it.Do you experience the munchies when you are sleep deprived?

Turns out, according to the second annual TD Bank Love and Money Study, millennials are better at handling their money and talking about it with their partners.The study says that 74% of millennial couples talk about their money weekly, and that those who do report higher levels of satisfaction and happiness in their relationships.This is very important, because as many relationship articles will tell you, money and talking about money is one of the highest stressors in relationships, which makes sense.

I was rearranging the bedclothes over my new knee when I realized the down comforter felt like lead, and lifting it felt like doing a bench press.That seemed curious, but I was so bent on getting the new knee to work properly that I ignored my sore arms as well as a stubborn stiffness in my neck and hips. Physical therapy was my focus, and the goal was to get back to my favorite pastime \u2014 rowing. It had kept me in shape for years, and I was missing early mornings on the Potomac.Months later, I still hadn\u2019t picked up an oar. Instead, I\u2019d endured anemia, weight loss, fevers, stiffness and sometimes excruciating pain in my hips and legs. I felt as if I\u2019d been hit by the flu, or maybe a truck. Getting out of bed was painful, and getting into a boat again seemed an impossible task.The culprit: polymyalgia rheumatica, or PMR, an autoimmune disease that spreads painful inflammation through most of the body\u2019s joints.Never heard of it? Neither had I. Yet it strikes many older Americans, usually in their 70s and 80s, more women than men. The afflicted are more often of Northern European extraction, indicating to researchers that genetics may be at work.Fortunately, PMR responds quickly to the steroid drug prednisone. The important thing is to recognize, not ignore, the symptoms and seek help. I felt better within a day of finally seeing my doctor, being diagnosed and taking my first dose of prednisone. In most cases, the condition can be cured, although slowly over months, sometimes years. And in some situations it can be complicated by a more serious disease.Why and how PMR strikes is mysterious, although researchers are looking at viruses or stress as triggers for the disease. But undeniably, it is associated with aging, and particularly the aging immune system.With the first wave of baby boomers heading into their 70s this year, America\u2019s elderly population will swell, and doctors think there will almost certainly be more cases of PMR.Basically, polymyalgia rheumatica tricks the immune system into attacking its own body \u2014 sending antibodies and immune cells into the hundreds of fluid-filled sacs called bursae that lie throughout our joints and surrounding soft tissue. In the healthy body, those sacs \u2014 some no wider than a dime, others the size of a silver dollar \u2014 keep our joints moving smoothly. But when inflamed by PMR, they cause pain and stiffness. PMR also impedes the bone marrow\u2019s ability to make red blood cells, causing anemia.Such an inflammatory response is like a complex cascade, according to Marcy O\u2019Koon Moss, director of consumer health for the Arthritis Foundation, which counts PMR among more than 100 diseases it focuses on.\"It\u2019s not one thing that happens. The cells involved signal each other and communicate,\" she said.Many people stricken with PMR confuse their symptoms with aging and just soldier on. But as the disease progresses and becomes more debilitating, most figure that something beyond old age is at work.Phil Ringo, 74, of Haverford, Pa., couldn\u2019t imagine what was wrong four years ago when he began feeling sore and ill.\"I thought I\u2019d gone from a pretty vigorous 70-year-old to an old, old man,\" he said. \"Grandchildren were saying, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with Papa?\u2019 \"Unable to get out of a chair or into a cab without a struggle, he got no answers from his doctors. And when he tried for an appointment with one of the nation\u2019s top diagnostic clinics, \"they basically said, \u2018You\u2019re an old guy.\u2019 \" Ringo said. \" \u2018 Just get used to it.\u2019 \" He was finally diagnosed and treated after a friend with the disease convinced him to see a rheumatologist.Actually PMR is famously tricky to diagnose.\"A definitive test does not exist for PMR,\" said rheumatologist Rebecca Manno, a Johns Hopkins School of Medicine faculty member and researcher. \"And there are other conditions that mimic PMR,\" such as rheumatoid arthritis, various infections and even some forms of cancer.So the diagnostic process can be torturous. Leslie Kermath, 70, of Whitefish, Mont., spent almost a month undergoing tests before her doctor felt confident that PMR was causing her pain, stiffness and fever.Along the way, she got antibiotics for an existing urinary tract infection, was sent to the hospital for a chest X-ray and a CAT scan after a test flagged a possible blood clot. Later she had another CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis, because her hips were terribly painful. A Lyme disease test came back negative.Eventually, her blood tests, which showed increasing levels of inflammation, plus her symptoms and age, nailed the diagnosis for Kermath\u2019s doctor, who started her on prednisone.\"How many women of Caucasian origin, who are older, think they\u2019re just aging and can\u2019t do everything they used to \u2014 when they actually have this disease?\" said Kermath, who is an avid hiker.Most doctors suspecting PMR order several blood tests, almost always two that look for inflammation: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, known as the ESR test, and another for CRP, or C-reactive protein. Doctors also check for antibodies associated with rheumatoid arthritis, to rule out that disease.When I finally dragged myself to my internist three months after my symptoms showed up, she immediately suspected PMR. Given my age \u2014 73 \u2014 my symptoms and lab results showing considerable inflammation and anemia, she started me on prednisone and sent me to a rheumatologist. After eight weeks of prednisone, my inflammation numbers had fallen to near normal and my anemia was under control.My rheumatologist has reduced my steroid dose, but only very gradually because rebounds do happen. The hope is that I can be steroid-free \u2014 a sign of a cure \u2014 sometime in 2017.\"Treating PMR is one of the more gratifying parts of my practice,\" said my doctor, Joseph P. Laukaitis. \"In my experience, about 95 percent of patients fully recover.\"For a PMR patient, prednisone feels like a miracle drug because it so quickly attacks inflammation and banishes the pain and stiffness. But in fact, prednisone is \"wonderful, wicked\" in Manno\u2019s words. The side effects that some people experience are considerable: a thinning of the bones (already a problem for many older women), high blood pressure, weight gain, high blood sugar, insomnia and a distinctive addition of facial fat known as \"moon face.\"Most patients who take prednisone for PMR will also be prescribed a drug to slow bone loss, and that medication, too, has side effects.Although diagnosing PMR can be difficult, doing so is crucial because a much more serious disease, giant cell arteritis, strikes about 10 to 20 percent of people with PMR. Giant cell arteritis causes inflammation and damage to blood vessels in the head and elsewhere. Untreated, it can cause blindness, stroke, even death. PMR patients can expect their doctors to look for symptoms of GCA: severe headaches, tender scalp, jaw pain and blurred vision.Any one of those can indicate that the arteries of the head are inflamed. The diagnosis often requires a biopsy of one of the arteries in the scalp to confirm inflammation. Again, prednisone is the treatment.Much of today\u2019s research into PMR and GCA looks for alternatives to prednisone.Biologics \u2014 drugs made from living organisms \u2014 hold promise because some can \"inhibit an inflammatory response as it picks up steam,\" the Arthritis Foundation\u2019s O\u2019Koon Moss said. \"It\u2019s like interrupting a chain reaction.\"\"There are also promising clinical trials of drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and have FDA approval for that. And they may be effective for PMR,\" Manno said.Until other drugs become available, prednisone will remain the preferred treatment despite all its of downsides.As I face months of treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica, taking smaller and smaller doses of prednisone each month, I hope to avoid remission and eventually regain my strength. Exercise is key, as it so often is when ill health strikes, so you\u2019ll find me on the stationary bike or walking or, if not rowing, at least beginning to build up stamina on the indoor rowing machine.The rowing season of 2016 may have eluded me, but the 2017 season is only months away.", "answers": {"answer_start": [881], "text": ["polymyalgia rheumatica"]}, "id": "820502522343411712"}, {"question": "Did You Know The Lids From Plastic Cups Were Made To Do This?", "context": "I\u2019ll admit it, I didn\u2019t until I recently read about this novel use for the plastic lids of Starbucks cups, like the kind they use for iced coffee.However, I\u2019m not part of the Starbucks cult fan base, as I only visit there at Christmas time for their beyond-belief-fantastic hot chocolate.

Armed with this information, scientists had for many years searched for the source of blue eyes on the OCA2 gene, but without success.More recently, a mutation to a separate, nearby gene called HERC2 has been identified as the cause of blue eyes. This alteration switches off OCA2, the gene that determines the amount of the brown pigment melanin that we make. It is thought to have first occurred when humans began to migrate from Africa to Europe, meaning that every person with blue eyes is a descendent of a single early European.The fact that every blue-eyed person alive today has this same mutation is pretty compelling evidence for this theory, although the identity of the initial mutant remains something of a mystery.

Judge grew up in Linden, California, about two hours from what was then Pac Bell Park.\"I was a Giants fan and that was the time he was putting up 70 homers a year,\" said Judge, who's now a 6-foot-7, 282-pound right fielder for the New York Yankees. \"That was pretty impressive to watch as a kid.\"On Wednesday, Judge will celebrate his 25th birthday by playing his first game in the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry. He will step to the plate as a rookie sensation; his six homers are tied for the second most in the American League.But it's not just about how many balls he has hit over the fence -- it's how far he has hit them. Judge is challenging the current champ, Giancarlo Stanton, as the king of the XXXL home run.Judge\u2019s 460-foot homer on Saturday in Pittsburgh was the third longest for a Yankee since ESPN started tracking distances in 2009. Only Alex Rodriguez's 477-foot homer in August 2015 and Juan Miranda's 469-foot shot in October 2009 traveled farther. In the past two seasons, Judge has three of the four longest Yankee homers. Only Chase Headley, with a 453-footer in July 2016, cracks the top four. Headley believes he got all of that one, but he said he and his teammates are eager to see what would happen if everything clicks in perfectly for Judge.\"We are all just waiting for that time where everything just syncs up and he gets every bit of it,\" Headley said. \"I want to see him do that. He is just a humongous human being that has out-of-this-world power. Five hundred fifty feet is not out of the question.

He remembers being around Stanton in the Arizona Fall League in 2009 and taking a few glances, but besides that, Castro said he has never been much of a gawker -- until now.\"He is the first guy,\" Castro said. \"I\u2019m really happy we are in the same group. It is really motivating. It is really fun to watch. We feel like every swing he takes, something big is going to happen.\"Matt Holliday, on the other hand, has always studied standout teammates and opponents in BP as if there'd be an exam afterward. It's not just tape-measure specialists, but contact guys too. Holliday looks for any little ingredient he can add to his game, making the 37-year-old slugger as qualified as anyone to weigh in on Judge\u2019s power.\"We are all just waiting for that time where everything just syncs up and he gets every bit of it ... I want to see him do that. He is just a humongous human being that has out-of-this-world power. Five-hundred fifty feet is not out of the question. If there is nothing in the way, he is hitting it 550.\"\"There aren\u2019t many guys that can hit the ball as far as him in batting practice, if any,\" Holliday said. \"Obviously, Stanton is the easy one that comes to mind that I\u2019ve played against. Barry Bonds, too.\"Holliday has seen Stanton do his damage only as an opponent, while he receives a daily dose of Judge. He said it might just be familiarity, but he would take Judge in a distance contest.Mark Teixeira, who just completed a 14-year career in which he swatted 409 homers, said he used to watch Nelson Cruz launch some balls in the Arlington heat when they were teammates in Texas. In 2013, Teixeira played with Stanton in the World Baseball Classic.\"Judge\u2019s power is right there with those two guys,\" said Teixeira, now an ESPN analyst.In 2016, Judge struck out in 42 of his 84 at-bats, a performance so bad it made the Yankees hesitant to hand him the right-field job in spring training, even with a full winter endorsement from team owner Hal Steinbrenner. In the final days, the Yankees finally gave Judge the nod over Aaron Hicks. Judge has struck out 17 times in 61 at-bats thus far.\"I knew it was going to take some time for him to get used to minor league pitching and big league pitching and really grow into his swing, because he is a big guy and he has to grow into his strike zone,\" Teixeira said. \"The smarter he has gotten about swinging at certain pitches and the more ready he is at the plate, he looks like he is so dangerous right now.

Iulian Valentin/ShutterstockIf processed foods are addictive, scientists have argued, it should be possible to create an addictiveness scale to find the crack cocaine among common meals. Surprising as it may seem, their answer isn't chocolate.\"We propose that highly processed foods share pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. concentrated dose, rapid rate of absorption) with drugs of abuse, due to the addition of fat and/or refined carbohydrates and the rapid rate the refined carbohydrates are absorbed into the system,\" write graduate student Erica Schulte and Dr. Ashley Gearhardt of the University of Michigan in PLOS ONEThe authors characterize addictiveness by factors such as \"loss of control over consumption, continued use despite negative consequences, and an inability to cut down despite the desire to do so.\" They back up their claims with a study of 504 participants, who helped them assess which foods are hardest to resist.\"Although the causes of obesity are multifactorial, one potential contributing factor is the idea certain foods may be capable of triggering an addictive response in some individuals, which may lead to unintended overeating,\" the authors write.To test the differences between foods, the authors had 120 undergraduate students fill out the Yale Food Addiction Scale , of which Gearhardt was one of the original authors, to determine the individuals' substance dependence. The students were then shown pictures of 35 common foods, presented in pairs, and asked to say which they considered more likely to produce addiction-like eating behaviors.Unsurprisingly, foods dense in fat and glycemic load (the amount of carbohydrate in a food multiplied by how swiftly it is converted to sugar) topped the scale. As the authors note, drinks with higher concentrations of alcohol are more addictive than their more diffuse counterparts. The finding is also consistent with animal studies, which highlight the role of dopamine, our brain's \"pleasure chemical\" that's often implicated in addiction. For instance, rats fed a diet consisting of highly processed foods showed changes to the brain's dopamine system that's also seen in response to illicit drugs.The respondents were segmented in order to explore how gender and body mass index (BMI) alter the difficulty to resist particular food components. Gender was not found to be relevant; people with high BMIs reported addictive-like attraction to more foods, although the correlation was not as strong as might be expected.Chocolate came up most often, followed by ice cream and french fries.However, the authors were not convinced they had solved the question of which food is the most craving-inducing. A further 384 people were asked online to rate the addictiveness of each food on a scale of 1 to 7.

The survey, released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University, didn't elaborate on what \"moral\" encompasses.That could help the Democratic candidate by making her policy positions appear stronger. According to new research, a perception of morality strengthens an argument, giving it more sway than opinions based on tradition or practicality.In the study, published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Ohio State University doctoral student Andrew Luttrell and his team hypothesized that the people or causes we most admire share a common trait: They're connected to our sense of morality, a psychological shield against outside attacks. As in: Oh, you disagree with me? Well, I won\u2019t be swayed because I\u2019m standing up for what\u2019s right.The researchers wanted to see if a person\u2019s opinion grew stronger or was more likely to withstand challenges if their viewpoint was declared to be \"moral.\" So, they set up a series of experiments with three groups of roughly 100 participants.[How Democratic and Republican morals compare to the rest of the world]Luttrell and his colleagues gave the first group, all college students, information about a new senior exam policy and asked them to write down their thoughts. Next, the participants, separated by partitions, received printed \"feedback\" on their opinions. Some were told their ideas on the phony exam policy reflected \"tradition.\" Others heard their ideas projected \"morality.\"Like this:\"While your thoughts were similar to other students' on a variety of dimensions, you seem to have based your thoughts about senior comprehensive exams on morality/tradition more than the average student.\"Simply telling someone their attitude was moral, Luttrull found, gave it more power. Compared to those in the \"tradition\" group, the participants who heard their thoughts reflected morality were more likely to say they\u2019d sign a petition to support the bogus policy, put their name on a list of students who support the policy and vote in favor of the policy. They marked their interest in these actions on a scale of one to nine:In the next two experiments \u2014 one with college students and one with a broader sample of adults \u2014 researchers asked participants to perform a similar task, this time focused on recycling.The group\u2019s consensus: Recycling is generally a good thing. After respondents wrote down their individual thoughts and took the same nine-point tests, they received feedback on their recycling beliefs. Some heard their views were \"practical.\" Others heard \"moral.\"Then the researchers tried to change everyone\u2019s mind. They slipped respondents a note that said recycling puts more cars on the road and encourages pollution.People's attitudes in the \"morality\" group and \"practicality\" group didn't significantly differ before they read the anti-recycling message. But afterward, a post-test revealed the \"moral\" respondents viewed recycling more favorably (7.56 on a nine-point scale) than the \"practical\" respondents (6.88).\"Those led to believe that their recycling attitudes were grounded in morality were more resistant to the anti-recycling message than those led to believe that their attitudes were grounded in practicality,\" the authors wrote.The takeaway, according to Luttrell: Framing a cause as \"moral\" is a smart tactic for politicians and advocates. Any issue, it appears, can be viewed through the morality lens, which is why we'll be probably fighting about politics forever.\"Is moral a magic word?\" he said. \"In some ways, it might be.

They can also search stations by artist, album or song to find stations that play similar music.Google's free music service comes two years after it introduced its paid version, which gives users access to more than 30 million songs for $10 per month. By creating free online radio stations, the tech giant is hoping to better compete against Spotify and Pandora, which have gained huge followings with their free music streaming services, and convert some free Google listeners into paying customers.Tuesday's premiere by Google coincides with recent tensions between streaming services and music artists. Over the weekend, Apple\u2019s upcoming paid streaming-music service faced withering criticism from pop singer Taylor Swift, who wrote a letter complaining about the company failing to pay artists royalties during a free three-month trial period.Apple quickly caved in. But it served as a big reminder about the tensions between the music streaming services and musicians, many of whom are angry about what they describe as low royalty rates.Google, with its new Internet radio, said it is paying the statutory rate to artists. As such, the company did not have to negotiate new deals with record labels. But Google is still vulnerable to some of the same challenges other streaming services over its payments to artists and record labels.On Google Music, Swift's previous records are available for streaming using the paid service but her most recent album, 1989, is only for sale. The album is not available on paid streaming nor will it be available on the free version.Spotify and Pandora\u2019s streaming services \u2014 both free and paid \u2014 have a big head start on Google. As competition heats up with Apple in the mix, Google will need a free service to pull in paid users. Google doesn\u2019t disclose subscriber numbers. But it did say that it has doubled the number of paid listeners in the last year.In comparison, Spotify recently revealed that it has 75 million users, 25 million of whom are paid subscribers.Google\u2019s free service will include two types of ads including a video pre-roll ad as well as banner ads. Marketers can buy ads as a part of the Google display and video networks.Some of the nuts and bolts behind Google's free streaming comes from Google acquisition last year of Songza, a music streaming service that used humans to curate playlists. Songza's team will help program the new streaming stations, in contrast to Pandora and Spotify, which are automated.Google says that with or without a subscription, users can continue store and play their own purchased music, which includes 50,000 songs, for free.", "answers": {"answer_start": [54], "text": ["Google"]}, "id": "613393346669772800"}, {"question": "Bernie Sanders' Secret Service code name is...", "context": "Vermont Sen.

Namely, the fact that there isn't much when it comes to African-American males, a troubling fact for one of the state's most elite institutions.A group of students, led by Sy Stokes, posted a video voicing their concerns about the number of black students on campus, and their message is hard to ignore. Stokes, a third-year Afro-American studies student who identifies as black, Cherokee and Chinese, recites a spoken word poem in the video, citing blaring statistics about the university's diversity issue.According to the school's enrollment statistics, African-Americans make up 3.8 percent of the student population. In the video, Stokes points out that black males make up 3.3 percent of the male student population, and that 65 percent of those black males are undergraduate athletes. Of the incoming men in the freshmen class, only 1.9 percent of them were black.In an interview with the Daily Bruin, Stokes said he almost dropped out of UCLA during his first year because he felt isolated and uncomfortable. Although he eventually found his niche in the minority community, he said he wanted to raise awareness about the school's lack of diversity before the university's application deadline on Nov. 30.\"We had to do something to put our issues on the map,\" Stokes said.In an email statement to the school paper, Janina Montero, vice chancellor of student affairs, said administrators acknowledge the need for more diversity and are attempting to work within the state's admission parameters.\"We certainly recognize that the low numbers of African Americans and other underrepresented students on campus does lead to a sense of isolation and invisibility,\" Montero said in her email statement. \"It is difficult to eliminate this painful imbalance without considering race in the admissions process.\"The state of California voted down affirmative action in 1996 and passed Proposition 209, which banned state schools from considering race, gender, ethnicity or national origins in their admissions processes. Black student enrollment has severely decreased since that provision and critics are saying that has to change.The students' video adds to the ongoing affirmative action debate both inside and outside of the state, raising awareness about diversity at institutions around the country. Stokes said he feels responsible for spreading the word about the unknown challenges of being a minority student at UCLA and the ongoing lack of diversity on campus.\"Being the cousin of Arthur Ashe, I feel as though it is my responsibility to uphold the strong voices of the Black Bruin community,\" he said.

The reasons for the parent\u2019s absence were varied randomly. It could be unintentional, for work, to volunteer for charity, to relax or to meet an illicit lover.Because the child\u2019s situation was exactly the same in all the intentional cases, the risks should also be identical.Asked what the dangers might be, participants listed the same ones in all circumstances, with a stranger harming the child the most common, followed by an accident.The unintentional case might be slightly more dangerous, because parents wouldn\u2019t have a chance to make provisions for their absence such as giving the child a phone and emergency instructions or parking the car in the shade.But survey respondents didn\u2019t see things this way at all.\"A mother\u2019s unintentional absence was seen as safer for the child than a mother\u2019s intentional absence for any reason, and a mother\u2019s work-related absence was seen as more dangerous than an unintentional absence, but less dangerous than if the mother left to pursue an illicit sexual affair,\" they write.The same was true for fathers, except that respondents rated leaving for work as posing no greater danger than leaving unintentionally.Moral disapproval informed beliefs about risks.That was true even when the survey explicitly separated the two factors, first asking participants to rate leaving the child from 1 (nothing wrong) to 10 (highly unethical/immoral).People rated the risk higher when they first made a moral judgment.\"People don\u2019t only think that leaving children alone is dangerous and therefore immoral,\" the researchers write.\"They also think it is immoral and therefore dangerous.\"That is, people overestimate the actual danger to children who are left alone by their parents, in order to better support or justify their moral condemnation of parents who do so.\"The result is a feedback loop that increases the legal and social penalties for leaving kids alone and reinforces the belief that even the briefest parental absence amounts to child abuse.These beliefs don\u2019t just affect busybodies.They lead police, prosecutors, judges and jurors to overestimate risks.Take what happened to Julie Koehler: she left her three daughters, ages 8, 5 and 4, watching a video in the minivan while she went into an Evanston, Illinois, Starbucks for three minutes. When she saw a police officer talking to the girls through the open windows, she thought nothing of it, until he returned and her 8-year-old started crying. She rushed out of the store, and the situation deteriorated from there.Koehler is a public defender in the homicide division. She knew she hadn\u2019t broken any laws and she had two lawyers, her husband and mother, to call to the scene.She wasn\u2019t arrested, but the state nonetheless initiated a child-abuse investigation.Officials interrogated the kids, required a pediatrician\u2019s exam, demanded that Koehler supply two references, and questioned them and her about her mental health, including whether she was on any medications.\"What if I was taking an anti-depressant? Would that have affected the outcome of the case?\" she asks.The investigation determined that the report of abuse was \"unfounded.\"But it taught Koehler the hazards of leaving your kids for even the briefest time under the safest circumstances.The real stranger danger doesn\u2019t come from would-be kidnappers.It comes from people who think they\u2019re doing good.", "answers": {"answer_start": [4838], "text": ["busybodies"]}, "id": "52wcr5"}, {"question": "Battlefield 1 might have a hilarious new game mode that sounds crazy", "context": "Battlefield 1 might have a hilarious new game mode that sounds crazyImage: www.battlefield.comBattlefield 1 has been one of the most hyped games this year and there has been a lot of rumors and leaks about it since its reveal.

Some consumers were crossing things off the list before back-to-school shopping even wrapped up.Erin Dunphy, 25, started her holiday shopping this summer. She says it\u2019s better for her wallet, and starting early better accommodates her work schedule.\"It really helps to spread out the spending that I want to do and really start to look at the things or experiences I want to give to others,\" says Erin. \"Also, August through February is my busiest time at work. So I make sure I try to cross things off my list early in the process.\"Erin also uses shopping early as a way to stick to a budget. She puts away money for the holidays well in advance, which guarantees she isn\u2019t draining her bank account as the holidays approach. It also spaces out her spending, and ensures she\u2019s not paying sizeable holiday markups on her purchases.\"I start saving early so I have a little stash that I know is for others. Buying now means if something goes wrong, I can pay for it all and not feel like I have to choose between [buying] presents or fixing my car if it were to break,\" she says.While we may cringe at the fact that holiday decorations go up as soon as the fake Halloween cobwebs get taken down, buying early does seem to be a budgeting tactic that a lot of millennials favor. According to the Rubicon Project While we may cringe at the fact that holiday decorations go up as soon as the fake Halloween cobwebs get taken down, buying early does seem to be a budgeting tactic that a lot of millennials favor. According to the Holiday Consumer Pulse survey , millennials are one of the primary groups controlling holiday spending this year. The Rubicon survey reports that millennials are predicted to spend an average of $1,427 in 2016, up from the $1,072 they spent last year. This is based off 1,003 interviews Rubicon conducted in late August 2016.Erin says she can see herself spending close to the millennial average by the time she\u2019s completed her shopping. She shops for her immediate family, her fiance\u0301, her fiance\u0301\u2019s parents and her two best friends.\"For the parents, nana and brother, my fiance\u0301 and I usually split the cost which helps tremendously. Right now I have all the friend presents, my mom\u2019s present and I know what I\u2019m getting for everyone,\" says Erin. \"My fiance\u0301 and I are going to Hawaii on our honeymoon, so we\u2019re getting each other an experience while we\u2019re there, that\u2019s the only one I\u2019m really waiting on.\"Millennials aren\u2019t the only ones controlling holiday shopping this year. Their spending still comes second to parents (though these two categories overlap). Parents plan to spend an average of more than $1,700 this holiday season. Not only is this about $300 more than they spent in 2015 (the average was $1,383 last year), but it\u2019s also substantially more than the $903 non-parents plan to spend.Parents are predicted to spend $495 per child this year, which is nearly $100 more than they spent last year. However, there is a discrepancy between how much each parent spends. Male parents plan to spend slightly more per child. The survey results for millennials and parents also revealed that more than half plan to buy a gift for themselves. (The men planning on buying gifts for themselves say they\u2019d spend approximately $400, compared to the average of $242 women say they\u2019ll spend on themselves.)As for where the money is going, millennials are by far the most digitally enabled shoppers, which means it will be another big holiday season for online retailers.\"Most of [my shopping] will be online,\" says Erin. \"It\u2019s just easier that way. I can compare prices a little easier than in the stores, and I use cash back extensions on my browser which helps get some money back.\"Walmart and Amazon are still predicted to be in the top retail spots for 2016 holiday shopping, but millennials heavily favor Amazon. And l ike Erin, 84% of shoppers research their gift selections online before committing.Overall, the average holiday shopper will spend $1,175 this year, up from last year\u2019s average of $1,051. Of those surveyed, 44% plan to spend more this year than they did in 2015.In addition, Cyber Monday sales might rival Black Friday sales this year. Of those surveyed, 42% will shop on Black Friday, but 47% will capitalize on Cyber Monday deals. Based on the behaviors of millennial and parent shoppers, it\u2019s not surprising that Cyber Monday will be so big; 58% of millennials say they are more compelled by online advertising than television advertising, while 38% of parents make purchases online directly from their mobile device.We\u2019re not even into October yet, so there\u2019s still plenty of time to start saving for your projected holiday expenses. And the sooner you start, the more you\u2019ll be able to budget little by little, instead of incurring one huge financial hit in December. Even if you\u2019re opposed to buying in October, you can start by browsing for sales, checking when prices on different items might drop, comparing reviews to find the right gifts, and of course, putting away whatever you can spare so you have a healthy holiday shopping stash.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1900], "text": ["$1,427"]}, "id": "554ep7"}, {"question": "This Rock Seems Out Of Place.

However, just because you can do something, doesn't mean you have to. The development team wants players of the new game to be abler to make their own decision as to how to play the game. This has apparently worked out so well that there's one major mechanic in the game you don't ever need to touch. I had a chance to sit down with both Watch Dogs 2 as well as the game's creative director where I learned that it's possible to beat Watch Dogs 2 without ever firing a gun. Something interesting is our LV Director, he finished the game without using the shooting mechanic...He used takedowns because sometimes in stealth you have to use them, but he never shot anyone. This is kind of our goal. You don't have to kill people and you don't have to shoot. Can we achieve that? Sometimes it's very difficult in a certain context, but we did it, so I'm super proud of that actually. The great appeal of open world games is that they're supposed to give you a variety of ways to attack any objective. However, quite often those same games tend to push you down a particular path, so one game mechanic is important in one mission and another is the focus later on. Ubisoft has tried to design Watch Dogs 2 so that players have more control. Jonathan Morin, the Creative Director of Watch Dogs 2 told me that while playing the game without guns isn't easy, it is possible. Instead, there are greater opportunities for using hacking in order to reach your goal. Every hackable object can be hacked in different ways, rather than just one, meaning that you have more control over how your environment reacts to you. The addition of rovers and drones also means that the player can get access to more areas without actually having to step foot in a place where you might be spotted. As a fan of the hacking aspect of the original Watch Dogs but not so much the Grand Theft Auto style gunplay, this more wide open world sounds much more interesting. I found myself far too often needing to fight off waves of enemies with a gun in the first game when I would much rather stun them with a hackable object before they even knew I was there. While my hands-on time with Watch Dogs 2 was limited, I can say I also never used a gun. Christopher Morin told me to \"think like a hacker\" while playing Watch Dogs 2, to consider how you can use the systems to solve the problems that you're dealing with. It gives the impression that the hacking aspect of the game has been set up more like a puzzle where the player will need to figure out how to hack the different parts of the game in order to solve it. However, the most important part of making that work is that you have to believe there is a solution. Based on the fact that you can apparently beat the game using only hacks and takedowns, it would appear the solution is possible. Will you try to beat Watch Dogs 2 without using a gun?

Pokemon has been around for what seems like forever, well actually 20 years now. For some of you readers, Pokemon may have been around since before you were born, which makes me feel even older considering I played link-battles on the school bus with my friends.With Nintendo's upcoming release of two new Pokemon titles, Pokemon Sun and Moon, I don't think they ever thought that their beloved games would wind up getting so complicated. But when you starting renaming one of the most famous characters in the franchise, it's easy to see why things are getting so complicated. With Nintendo's attempt to unify game releases in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan the games are going to be released in both traditional and simplified Chinese. This may not seem like a big deal, but until now differences in culture and dialect have spawned a variety of translations. This is going to change with Sun and Moon and as reported by Zheping Huang in Quartz, this is what we'll see:Now Nintendo wants to unify them: Poke\u0301mon in Greater China will be officially called \u7cbe\u9748\u5bf6\u53ef\u5922, or Jingling Baokemeng in Mandarin (Jingling means \"spirit\" or \"elf,\" and Baokemeng is a transliteration of Poke\u0301mon). Earlier in Hong Kong, it was \u5bf5\u7269\u5c0f\u7cbe\u9748 Pet Little Elves (or Spirits), while in Taiwan, it was \u795e\u5947\u5bf6\u8c9d, Magic Babies.This probably makes sense if you live in any area with a singular dialect, but when you're trying to make one unified language version of a game to an area that has several unique dialects there are bound to be some twists.Hong Kong is where one of these twists can be found - Hong Kong being where the common language has always been Cantonese, rather than Mandarin. Because Pokemon Sun and Moon will be translated into Mandarin now, it's causing a stir because Pikachu now has a new name!That's Right, I said it, Pikachu is now PikaqiuPikachu was originally translated as \u6bd4\u5361\u8d85 (Bei-kaa-chyu) in Hong Kong. Now it is named \u76ae\u5361\u4e18 (Pikaqiu). While the name \u76ae\u5361\u4e18 in Mandarin sounds similar to the global name Pikachu (as it was always called in China and Taiwan), it reads as Pei-kaa-jau in Cantonese, which doesn\u2019t sound the same at all.Fans of the bright electric mouse have been protesting NIntendo's translating choice saying that they will never buy from Nintendo again.

However, greenhouse gases as a result of human activity over the past 45 years \"have increased the rate of temperature rise to 1.7 degrees Celsius per century, dwarfing the natural background rate\".According to the two authors, these figures represent a change that is 170 times faster than natural forces.\"We are not saying the astronomical forces of our solar system or geological processes have disappeared, but in terms of their impact in such a short period of time they are now negligible compared with our own influence,\" Steffen said.\"Crystallising this evidence in the form of a simple equation gives the current situation a clarity that the wealth of data often dilutes.\"What we do is give a very specific number to show how humans are affecting the earth over a short timeframe.

Of course, the surprise was lessened by the news that the study was funded in totality by the American Beverage Association, the membership of which includes many soft drink companies.Due to the recency of those findings (they circulated in June 2014), the results haven\u2019t been totally disproven.

They did so five times per week for 24 weeks.The group drinking the water after their meals had a larger average weight loss than those who stuck with the diet beverages, and also improved the water group\u2019s insulin resistance, the benefit of which could be leveraged in various medical treatments.This is among the first studies to offer a rebuttal to the ABA-funded study, and it suggests, as many would believe, diet beverages do not beat water when it comes to losing weight.", "answers": {"answer_start": [130], "text": ["water"]}, "id": "1100188040002123_1112696008751326"}, {"question": "Is this @tomhanks best performance ever?", "context": "Tom Hanks has the scene in \"Captain Phillips,\" a moment that will play during the Academy Awards when Jennifer Lawrence announces Hanks as a Best Actor nominee on March 2, 2014. That Hanks, a two-time Best Actor winner and five-time nominee, is at his very best before the key sequence in Paul Greengrass' new film should provide Oscar prognosticators with all they need to know about the 57-year-old actor's awards chances.\"Captain Phillips\" is set to open the 2013 New York Film Festival, but Sony and producer Scott Rudin set up screenings this week for critics and journalists to see the film while all eyes are fixed on Toronto. Thus far, the move paid off: reviews have been solid, with some (In Contention editor Kris Tapley, HuffPost Entertainment's own Mike Ryan) more infatuated with the film than others (Variety critic Scott Foundas, The Wrap critic Alonso Duralde). Heed the words from the former camp: \"Captain Phillips\" stands at the very top of the recent spate of thinking-persons' action films from the last few years, on par with Kathryn Bigelow's \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and well ahead of Ben Affleck's Best Picture-winning \"Argo.\"The reason is Hanks, who gives the type of performance everyone has wanted to see from Tom Hanks since the early 2000s. His Richard Phillips is not the most emotional of men: an opening scene with his wife (played very briefly but beautifully by Catherine Keener) establishes him as the kind of thoughtful, quiet type who one can assume watches the History Channel and likes Tommy Lee Jones movies. Yet as Greengrass keeps turning the screws on Phillips and his situation, that cool demeanor begins to crack, shatter and, later, turn to dust. Hanks is put through the ringer -- Greengrass' closed-quarters camera work keeps in him the action even as things get impossibly physical -- and the results are breathtaking. Like the best acting, Hanks' performance actually feels real. By the end of the film, it's hard to tell where Hanks ends and Phillips begins.This is the time of year when a new Oscar front-runner debuts almost every day (\"Gravity\" and \"12 Years A Slave\" reached the top of the line after raves last week). Yet \"Captain Phillips\" belongs in those whispered early awards musings, not just for Hanks and Greengrass (a previous nominee for \"United 93,\" a film that bears similarities to \"Captain Phillips\" in structure and form), but for Best Editing (Christopher Rouse), Best Cinematography (Barry Ackroyd), Best Adapted Screenplay (Billy Ray) and, if a wave of support carries the film to multiple nominations, perhaps Best Supporting Actor for Barkhad Abdi. The newcomer plays Muse, the lead Somali pirate in the film, a relatively decent man turned to evil behavior by his standing in life. Abdi (and Barkhad Addirahman, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M. Ali as the other pirates) helps keep the film from ever truly demonizing Phillips' kidnappers, an easy pitfall that Greengrass deftly avoids. The problem is that Abdi doesn't have an easy road to Supporting Actor: the category is as loaded as usual, with actors like Daniel Bruhl (for \"Rush\"), Michael Fassbender (for \"12 Years A Slave\"), Josh Brolin (for \"Labor Day\"), Steve Coogan (for \"Philomena\"), Bradley Cooper (for \"American Hustle\") and even Hanks (for \"Saving Mr. Banks\") potentially standing in his way.That, however, is back-room chatter for another day.

LOZANO, Associated PressHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Evidence from more than 6,600 rape kits that went untested for years in Houston have turned up 850 hits in the FBI's nationwide database of DNA profiles, marking a major step in the city's $6 million effort to address the backlog, officials announced Monday.Charges have been filed against 29 people, six of whom have been convicted, since the city launched an effort in 2013 to test 6,663 rape kits \u2014 some of which dated back nearly three decades. Testing was completed in the fall, and the results have now been uploaded to a database used by investigators nationwide to compare DNA profiles of possible suspects, Mayor Annise Parker said.\"This milestone is of special importance to rape survivors and their families and friends because it means their cases are receiving the attention they should have years ago,\" Parker said at a news conference, where she joined local law enforcement officials to announce the results.Police are continuing to review the matches to see if charges can be filed in other cases. In the cases where prosecutors have won convictions, defendants have received sentences ranging from 2 to 45 years in prison. One case was dismissed after the victim decided not to pursue the case.Rape kits include biological samples and physical evidence gathered from sexual assault victims that are later processed to see if they match a suspect's DNA. Testing results are uploaded to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS.Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said there were some cases where suspects committed other crimes while rape kits that could have identified them sat untested.\"Now that the testing of these kits is complete, we know that it's up to us to finish the job and to seek justice for these victims. The ball is in our court and we will do our best to put the people who are responsible for these heinous crimes behind bars for as long as possible,\" she said.Experts say Houston's backlog \u2014 and similar backlogs in other U.S. cities \u2014 are due in part to the high cost of testing which can run from $500 to $1,000 per kit, though advocates argue that the lack of testing signals that sex crimes haven't always been law enforcement priorities.More than 12,000 kits went untested for years in Memphis, Tennessee, which is facing a lawsuit from rape victims as it tries to test the kits. In Detroit, prosecutors discovered more than 11,000 rape kits in an abandoned police warehouse in 2009, and Cleveland prosecutors have sent their entire 4,700-kit backlog for testing.\"This is not a Houston problem.

Strong has previously made her mark on Weekend Update with her popular character \"The Girl You Wish You Hadn't Started a Conversation with at a Party.\"Previously, Meyers gave Strong special praise in an interview with Jimmy Fallon, saying that Strong's \"natural ability has kind of blown everybody away.\"He tweeted a joke about Strong transitioning from a character to a co-anchor:As for The Girl You Wish You Hadn't Started a Conversation with, it's prob safe to assume that she died somewhere, mid-conversation. \u2014 Seth Meyers (@sethmeyers) September 15, 2013In addition to the changing of the Weekend Update guard, the upcoming season has drawn more curiosity than most.

Sylvia Allen (R), would allow lawmakers to meet privately to negotiate and draft measures and would require them to have public debate only once a body takes an action, such as a vote. Arizona's current laws require that officials hold a public meeting any time a quorum discusses matters that could result in legal action.State Sen. Carlyle Begay (D), one of the bill's co-sponsors, told The Huffington Post that the state's requirements on open meetings make it extremely difficult for lawmakers who represent rural areas, where officials have to travel hours to be in the same room, to accomplish anything. That can make it hard for officials to deal with matters that need urgent and swift attention, Begay said.\"It's a way to update how our elected officials are able to converse to associate with elected officials they sit on boards with in a way that allows them to do their business, to advocate and represent the best interests of their communities a lot easier,\" Begay said. \"Right now it's a hardship for these officials because they have to post open meeting laws and post notice for simple discussions if they need to get together to address issues.\"Begay said the bill isn't intended to give lawmakers an opportunity to discuss \"unethical or immoral criminal issues behind closed doors.\"\"We're all held to a certain standard and I think that's the expectation that we're not trying to decrease transparency and openness but we're leaving that discretion to the elected officials themselves to ensure that when public input and public comment is needed that they do that,\" he said.In fact, Allen told the Arizona Daily Sun that the state's open meetings laws produce an undemocratic law-making process. Because officials aren't allowed to meet privately to discuss legislation, officials must send staffers to serve as a go-between among colleagues to reach a consensus. That process, Allen told the Arizona Daily Sun, is undemocratic because it allows unelected staff members to play a central role in drafting laws.\"Staff wasn't elected, staff isn't accountable,\" Allen told the Daily Sun.Dan Barr, a First Amendment lawyer with the firm Perkins Coie, said the time when a policy is deliberated before a measure is introduced is a critical point for public input.\"It allows you to see how your various public officials are approaching their jobs, how they view certain issues, what their thought process is, what their reasoning process is,\" Barr told The Huffington Post. \"It allows people then to participate in that.\"Barr added that open meetings laws shouldn't be weakened just because they make the lives of elected officials more difficult.\"Efficiency in government is not the primary goal of a democracy,\" Barr told The Huffington Post. \"Our whole theory of government is that the people are the governors and that they give limited power to the government, and for the public to adequately assess what its government is doing, it needs as much transparency as possible.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [14], "text": ["Arizona"]}, "id": "563469314997886977"}, {"question": "Here's A New Clue About Where 'The Simpsons' Actually Takes Place", "context": "If you still have any energy left after waiting for an answer over the course of all these years, begin to !!!!!!!!!!\"I would say just judging by the street names and locations, it\u2019s closer to Springfield, Oregon, where Matt Groening is from, than any other Springfield,\" said Jean.Jean began his answer by saying the team behind \"The Simpsons\" could never actually reveal that, but then continued with a hint that was more or less an admission.During a press conference call promoting the series\u2019 new season that began last Sunday, a reporter from MyNewYorkEye bluntly asked executive producer Al Jean, \"Where is Springfield? Do you want to tell which state Springfield is in?\"So by this point, with \"The Simpsons\" entering its 28th season and still officially maintaining the mystery, any clue as to where the real Springfield is could be noteworthy.The Simpson family has resided in the American town of Springfield for nearly three decades. But despite millions of fellow Americans watching their lives every week, nobody has ever figured out where their \"Springfield\" actually is. The town name is extremely popular in this country and the family\u2019s creator, Matt Groening, has never quite revealed its true location.Groening has actually said in the past that the Springfield in the show was named after Springfield, Oregon, but didn\u2019t go so far as to admit \"street names and locations\" were, as well.In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine titled a piece In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine titled a piece \"Matt Groening Reveals the Location of the Real Springfield.\" Here\u2019s part of the piece that gets into the Oregon connection:OK, why do the Simpsons live in a town called Springfield? Isn\u2019t that a little generic? Springfield was named after Springfield, Oregon. The only reason is that when I was a kid, the TV show \"Father Knows Best\" took place in the town of Springfield, and I was thrilled because I imagined that it was the town next to Portland, my hometown. When I grew up, I realized it was just a fictitious name. I also figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, \"This will be cool; everyone will think it\u2019s their Springfield.\" And they do. You\u2019ve never said it was named after Springfield, Oregon, before, have you? I don\u2019t want to ruin it for people, you know? Whenever people say it\u2019s Springfield, Ohio, or Springfield, Massachusetts, or Springfield, wherever, I always go, \"Yup, that\u2019s right.\"This article led to quite a bit of backtracking from both Groening and Jean as they then claimed the location of the town still remained a mystery. The show responded to the article with a chalkboard gag where Bart Simpson repeatedly wrote, \"The true location of Springfield is in any state but yours.\"Jean told Jean told TV Guide at the time that Smithsonian Magazine \"misinterpreted something [he has] heard [Groening] say for at least 10 or 20 years.\" Jean continued, \"He was inspired by growing up in Portland, but it\u2019s really an every town. It\u2019s really funny. Matt grew up in Oregon and parts of \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 were definitely inspired by his childhood. But there is no specific state that Springfield is in, and we will never reveal that secret.\"Further trying to dispel that Groening revealed the location, Jean reminded TV Guide readers that \"The Simpsons Movie\" hinted that the town\u2019s true whereabouts are geographically impossible.\"In the movie we say [Springfield] borders on Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky,\" said Jean. \"So good luck finding that state. When you do, you\u2019re a true \u2018Simpsons\u2019 fan.\"For what it\u2019s worth, Ohio has a city named Oregon. The state of Oregon does border Nevada. The city of Portland, Oregon, was named after the city of Portland, Maine. And there is an unincorporated community that calls itself \"Oregon\" in Kentucky.In a way (however tenuous), all of those named states from the movie have geographical connections to Oregon. \"The Simpsons\" Springfield = Springfield, Oregon. The homepage of the official website for the Oregonian city even claims, \"Yes, this is the \u2018real\u2019 Springfield from \u2018The Simpsons.\u2019\"Of course, even if this is true, Jean and Groening will likely never fully admit it. Jean continued his answer about Springfield, Oregon, during the press conference by saying, \"But the great thing about [the show\u2019s city] is it\u2019s universal. I grew up in Michigan, and I can totally relate to it.

Rubbing? Grinding?). To keep things simple and specific, we\u2019ll just focus on the time to ejaculation.Measuring an average time to ejaculation is not a straightforward matter. What about just asking people how long they take, you say? Well, there are two main problems with this. One is that people are likely to be biased upwards in their time estimates, because it\u2019s socially desirable to say you go long into the night.The other problem is that people don\u2019t necessarily know how long they go for. Sex isn\u2019t something people normally do while monitoring the bedside clock, and unassisted time estimation may be difficult during a transportative session of love-making.What does the research say?The best study we have estimating the average time to ejaculation in the general population involved 500 couples from around the world timing themselves having sex over a four-week period \u2013 using a stopwatch.That is as practically awkward as it sounds: participants pressed \"start\" at penile penetration and \"stop\" at ejaculation. You may note this could affect the mood somewhat, and might perhaps not exactly reflect the natural flow of things. But \u2013 science is rarely perfect, and this is the best we\u2019ve got.So what did the researchers find? The most striking result is that there was a huge amount of variation.

The average (median, technically) across all couples, though, was 5.4 minutes. This means that if you line up the 500 couples from shortest sex to longest sex, the middle couple goes for an average of 5.4 minutes each time they do it.There were some interesting secondary results, too. For example, condom use didn\u2019t seem to affect the time, and neither did men\u2019s being circumcised or not, which challenges some conventional wisdom regarding penile sensitivity and its relationship to staying power in the sack.It didn\u2019t much matter which country the couples came from either \u2013 unless they came from Turkey, in which case their sex tended to be significantly shorter (3.7 minutes) than couples from other countries (Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Another surprising finding was that the older the couple, the shorter the sex, contrary to the prevailing wisdom (probably peddled by older men).Why do we have sex for so long?As an evolutionary researcher, all this talk of how long sex lasts make me wonder: Why does it last any time at all? All sex really needs to achieve, it seems, is to put sperm into the vagina. Why all the thrusting and bumping? Instead of sliding the penis in and out many hundreds of times per sexual session, why not just put it in once, ejaculate, and then go have a lemonade and get on with the rest of the day?Before you say, Because it\u2019s fun to go in and out!, remember evolution doesn\u2019t care about fun per se \u2013 it generally only \"designs\" things to be enjoyable if they helped our ancestors pass on their genes to future generations. For example, even though we like eating food, we don\u2019t chew each mouthful of it for five minutes just to make the enjoyment last longer.

In 2003, researchers showed \u2013 using artificial vaginas, artificial penises, and artificial sperm (corn syrup) \u2013 that the ridge around the head of the penis actually scoops out pre-existing syrup from the vagina.What this suggests is that men\u2019s repeated thrusting might function to displace other men\u2019s semen before ejaculating, ensuring their own swimmers have a better chance of reaching the egg first. Incidentally, this could explain why it becomes painful for a man to continue thrusting after ejaculating, since that would risk scooping out his own semen as well.So what to do with this information?

The nephew, Joe Ledington, did have it in a handwritten note taken from the colonel's second wife's will, and he claims that his job as a boy was to mix the spice blend in a tub.The famous blend of 11 herbs and spices includes only one real surprise: a ton of white pepper.\"The main ingredient is white pepper,\" Ledington told the Chicago Tribune. \"I call that the secret ingredient. Nobody knew what white pepper was. Nobody knew how to use it\" in the 1950s.Food scientist Dr. Steven Witherly, author of \"Why Humans Like Junk Food,\" was taken aback when he saw the recipe.\"Wow, that much white pepper?\" he says was his first reaction.But he also thinks that it makes a lot of sense.\"I've had a lot of chefs tell me that the most underappreciated of all spices is white pepper because it has subtle but very strong effects on the sensory system,\" Witherly said.White pepper is the husked form of the more common black pepper. Cooks Illustrated says that it has a more floral, earthy flavor and greater complexity, while black pepper is more aromatic with more spicy heat. Interestingly, Google searches for white pepper have doubled over the past decade.White pepper also has some powerful physiological effects thanks to a compound called piperine. Piperine has been shown to do a wide variety of things, including activating taste receptors to make salt taste saltier and sugar taste sweeter, activating a special receptor in your brain that triggers the release of feel-good endorphins, increasing intestinal water flow and production of digestive enzymes, and possibly even helping to counteract the effects of high-fat diets.The upshot, according to Witherly, is that it could make KFC more addicting.\"One of the theories I've put forth is that if you eat something that does something to you and it's beneficial, your brain figures it out ... it wants you to do it again,\" Witherly says.KFC's alleged secret recipe is as follows:2 cups white flour plus 2/3 tbsp. salt1/2 tbsp. thyme1/2 tbsp. basil1/3 tbsp. oregano1 tbsp. celery salt1 tbsp. black pepper1 tbsp. dried mustard4 tbsp. paprika2 tbsp. garlic salt1 tbsp. ground ginger3 tbsp. white pepperAs great as white pepper may be, of course, other factors may be more important in making it delicious. Witherly concludes in \"Why Humans Like Junk Food\" that the key to KFC's deliciousness is the combination of flavor-active compounds flour, salt, pepper, and MSG with a pressure-cooking technique that retains the chicken's moistness and juiciness.And that's why 12 million people eat KFC every day.", "answers": {"answer_start": [444], "text": ["white pepper"]}, "id": "770585517859700736"}, {"question": "Sex experts think that more straight men are exploring a formerly taboo hot spot", "context": "I was sitting around the fire pit in my backyard with a handful of straight male friends when drunken conversation inevitably turned to sex.

It wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d heard young heterosexual men talking about being on the receiving end of a wandering finger, or female friends dishing on their male partners\u2019 self-directed anal fixation, but the consensus in the room was startling nonetheless. For perhaps the first time in my life, I felt like a sexual square.Then, a week later, heavily circulated rumors (that have been completely unverified) alleged that R&B singer Usher\u2019s unreleased sex tape showed him on the receiving end of sex with his wife (perhaps wielding a strap-on). It\u2019s no secret that more Americans are having anal sex than ever before: A study published last year in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that more than 45 percent of women in their late 20s had tried anal sex. For my generation, the back-door option is like what the blow job was to the generation that came before \u2014 just a fun new taboo waiting to be broken. The phenomenon of heterosexual guys participating in all sorts of arse play is something different, though. I\u2019ve seen female-on-male strap-on sex go from the sort of thing tittered about in women\u2019s magazines to hearing a male friend once drunkenly blurting out in a bar that he loved it.But I live in San Francisco; my sample is skewed. I set out to find some reliable data on the matter, but no such luck. As Debby Herbenick, a co-author of the study mentioned above and a sexual health educator at the Kinsey Institute, told me: \"There is no good national-level data on this topic.\" Her research reflected that 11 percent of men in their early 20s reported having been on the receiving end of anal sex. But that survey didn\u2019t specify whether there was a sex toy or penis involved, or if it was oral or digital stimulation.Without solid stats, the best way to get some perspective on this phenomenon is to talk to sexologists. Charlie Glickman, a Good Vibrations sex educator, told me that he believed \"more heterosexual men are discovering prostate and anal play with their female partners than ever before.\" His colleague Carol Queen, a staff sexologist, says, \"Lots of guys don\u2019t talk about [it], but do it anyway,\" and \"plenty of heterosexual men include anal penetration in masturbation at least sometimes.\" In the years after her educational X-rated video \"Bend Over Boyfriend\" premiered in 1998, it was the shop\u2019s best-selling tape, and the top rental. Tristan Taormino, the sex educator behind several anal-focused porn flicks, including the \"Expert Guide to Anal Pleasure for Men,\" has noticed that guys are increasingly \"feeling safe enough to explore their fantasies\" in this area.Part of this is due to the practice rising to mainstream awareness. In 2001, popular sex columnist Dan Savage held a contest to come up with a slang word to describe the act. The winner was \"peg\" (the runner-up was \"bob,\" as in \"bend over boyfriend\"). It\u2019s a lot easier to talk about when you have a cute verb to describe it. Another major factor is that the stigma of receptive anal play as \"a gay thing\" has been somewhat lessened. I\u2019ve seen defensively heterosexual guys boast about prostate stimulation; these are the kind of guys I\u2019ve actually heard use the irritating I\u2019m-not-gay qualifier \"No homo\" (as in, \"I like your shirt \u2014 no homo\") \u2014 before I wallop them over the head. They haven\u2019t adopted a more fluid understanding of sexual orientation or anything; they\u2019ve just welcomed a new form of stimulation into their definition of acceptable straight sex. As Carol Queen joked, \"I wish I had a nickel for every time I\u2019ve had to explain that it is the gender of the partner rather than the sex act desired that speaks to a person\u2019s sexual orientation.\"", "answers": {"answer_start": [1146], "text": ["anal sex"]}, "id": "595980153529999360"}, {"question": "Both Campaigns Stunned After Houston Chronicle Makes VERY Surprising Endorsement", "context": "One of the largest newspapers in all of Texas, which One of the largest newspapers in all of Texas, which previously endorsed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, has now officially endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.On Friday, the On Friday, the Houston Chronicle made its official endorsement known in an article titled: \"These are unsettling times that require a steady hand: That\u2019s not Donald Trump.\"\u2018Any one of Trump\u2019s less-than-sterling qualities \u2014 his erratic temperament, his dodgy business practices, his racism, his Putin-like strongman inclinations and faux-populist demagoguery, his contempt for the rule of law, his ignorance \u2014 is enough to be disqualifying.

Normally, they wouldn\u2019t endorse any candidate this early in the race, but they explained their reason for doing so as follows:\u2018The Chronicle editorial page does not typically endorse early in an election cycle; we prefer waiting for the campaign to play out and for issues to emerge and be addressed. We make an exception in the 2016 presidential race, because the choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is not merely political. It is something much more basic than party preference.\u2019 \u2018An election between the Democrat Clinton and, let\u2019s say, the Republican Jeb Bush or John Kasich or Marco Rubio, even the hyper-ideological Ted Cruz, would spark a much-needed debate about the role of government and the nation\u2019s future, about each candidate\u2019s experience and abilities. To choose the candidate who defeated them \u2014 fairly and decisively, we should point out \u2014 is to repudiate the most basic notions of competence and capability.\u2019The Houston Chronicle clearly recognizes the fact that the Republican presidential nominee has sent the Republican party into turmoil. Many Republicans have purposely distanced themselves from Donald Trump, and there will undoubtedly be more Republicans giving a wide berth to the GOP candidate before the November election is upon us. Being that Texas is considered a \"red\" state, it is safe to assume that this election is about a lot more than respective parties.Michelle Obama rationalized this line of thought best in her Michelle Obama rationalized this line of thought best in her DNC speech\u2018Because when you have the nuclear codes at your fingertips and the military at your command, you can\u2019t make snap decisions.

You need to be steady and measured and well-informed.\u2019The issues affecting the United States are outlined by the Houston Chronicle, as are the reasons why Clinton is the best choice to address them. Clinton is praised for her experience and knowledge when it comes to issues like healthcare, energy, immigration, and foreign policy.\u2018On the issues, there\u2019s no comparison in terms of thoughtfulness, thoroughness and practicality. Acknowledging the influence of erstwhile competitor Bernie Sanders for example, she will focus as president on repairing an economy that has left many working people behind and struggling. She will address income inequality and wage stagnation and will work to create jobs. She\u2019ll work with Congress to end tax loopholes.
